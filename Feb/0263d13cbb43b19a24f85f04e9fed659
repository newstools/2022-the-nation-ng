Kidnappers on Sunday abducted Presiding Justice of the Court of Appeal, Owerri Division, Rita Pemu, around 11am. The Judge was seized while travelling from Owerri to Benin city along Azia-Orsumoghu-Ihiala Road. Disclosing this in a statement, the Chairman of Nigeria Bar Association(NBA) in Imo State, Bar, J.I. Ogamba and Secretary, Chinedu Agu, said when they paid His Lordship a visit at 5pm on Monday, it was gathered the kidnappers double-crossed His Lordship’s vehicle at a speed break, ordering her to lie prostrate on the road while pointing guns menacingly on her head. The statement said Hon. Justice Pemu, who by happenstance was in her Hiace Bus instead of her SUV dressed in a simple, spartan and free-flowing gown, was mistaken by the kidnappers as one of “Oga’s stewards,” as they kept demanding to know in which car their “Oga” was.
