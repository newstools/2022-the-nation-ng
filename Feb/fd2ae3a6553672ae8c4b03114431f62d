Edo State Deputy Governor Comrade Philip Shaibu has lauded the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) for sticking with the coaching duo of Augustine Eguavoen and Emmanuel Amuneke to tinker the Super Eagles ahead of the decisive FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 Playoff against Ghana in March.  “ My first fear was that they (NFF) were going to bring the white man (Jose Peseiro) to coach the Super Eagles,” the sport-loving Shaibu said in Lagos at the weekend. “ It was a fear for me; but I celebrated when I heard Eguavoen will remain and over the appointment of Amuneke because I know they are professionals and I know they can work together.”  Shaibu likened the appoint of Eguavoen and Amuneke to the heady days when the Super Eagles was managed by late coach Shaibu Amodu and Stephen Keshi, adding the two must overcome innate differences in order to seal Nigeria’s qualification for her eighth Mundial after missing only the 2006 edition since her debut at the USA’94 finals.
