Pan Yoruba socio-political organisation Afenifere has expressed support for the position of Southern Governors’ Forum (SGF) on the need for power to shift to the South in 2023, as reiterated by its Chairman, Governor Rotimi Akeredolu, while hosting members of the “Power Shift Movement”, who visited him in his office in Akure. The Movement was led to the governor by its leader, Dr. Pogu Bitrus and co-chair, General Collins Ihekire (rtd). The stand was contained in a statement by the National Publicity Secretary of Afenifere, Jare Ajayi, following the criticism of Akeredolu by Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) and Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG).
