Chelsea snatched a 1-0 win at Crystal Palace on Saturday courtesy of an 89th minute strike by Hakim Ziyech as the newly crowned world champions returned to winning ways in the Premier League after nearly a month’s absence.

Palace limited the visitors to only a handful of opportunities including a 35-yard pile-driver shot by centre-half Antonio Rudiger in the 11th minute that Vicente Guaita palmed away acrobatically.
