Rapper Ycee has offered suggestions on how to handle mental health. He said those suffering from mental health should speak up and seek help. He spoke against the background of the recent spike in suicide among young entertainers locally and internationally. A popular Dubai-based socialite, Sodiq Oluwadamilola aka Dammie Richie reportedly committed suicide after battling depression at the weekend. Just like Hushpuppi, Dammie Richie was known for his lavish display of his assets and wealth on social media. He reportedly died after battling depression for about two years.

Empathising with sufferers of mental health issues, Ycee empahsised the importance of setting aside shame and speaking up. The 29-year-old “Condo” singer also urged sufferers to seek professional intervention which he noted was more result-oriented than the short-term relief they get from consuming weed and alcohol. He wrote: “Feel like a lotta people going through a lot and not speaking about it cos they don’t wanna show but I promise you, internalizing your issues will eat you up!! “Mental health problems are no joke. DO NOT BE ASHAMED TO SEEK HELP. “Speaking with a professional and getting a diagnosis goes a long way. The quicker you do this, the quicker you can get the right prescription medicine to help you (weed and alcohol will only provide temporary relief).”
