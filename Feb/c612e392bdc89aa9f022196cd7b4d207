Former House of Representatives Deputy Speaker Chibudom Nwuche has commended President Muhammadu Buhari for signing the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill into law. By this singular act, according to Nwuche, Buhari has returned the confidence of the generality of Nigerians into the electoral process. He stated many well-meaning Nigerians were beginning to lose faith in the electoral process but for the timely assent to the bill that ensures electronic transmission of results. He also commended the National Assembly for passing the bill, which will reasonably guarantee free and fair elections so that democracy can be entrenched and the votes of the masses will count.

He noted that such leaders will not work for the masses as they didn’t get into positions of authority and trust with their votes, but rather via rigging, godfatherism, or vote-buying. “Good governance that delivers the dividends of democracy and leads to rapid socio-economic development begins on a foundation of free, fair, and credible elections. “Countries that have entrenched free and fair elections will develop more rapidly than those that haven’t,” he said.
