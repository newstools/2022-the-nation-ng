The transfer, which is approved by the National Pension Commission (PenCom) under its RSA Transfer System (RTS), was concluded in the first week of last October. The commission created the RTS for aggrieved contributors to switch their PFAs to ensure good customer service among PFAs. The Director-General (DG), PenCom in a report obtained by the newspaper, said the transfers covered requests submitted by PFAs between last June and August. She stated that of the RSA Transfers initiated, 12,872 RSAs were transferred to their new PFAs along with their pension assets, while the others were outstanding due to non-upload of the transaction history of their RSAs. - Advertisement - On the RSA membership count by PFA, the PenCom boss said PFAs registered78,115 RSAs under the Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS) during the quarter under review. She said this brought the cumulative RSA registrations to 9,461,173 by last September. She further stated that an analysis of the new registrations under  the CPS showed that 85 per cent of them were below 40 years.
