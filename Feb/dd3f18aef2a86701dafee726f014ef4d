According to him: “This is simply a case of assassination because they went to only the victim’s house, killed him and left the community. They did not take anything in his house neither did they attack the guard and his wife. “Even the other village that was attacked, no life was lost. They just caused commotion and left. We feel they just did that to make it look like an attack. “We have been facing various security breaches in the community informed by the vast ungoverned land taken over by the Nigerian Air Force (NAF). You know we were in court, we won at the High Court but they appealed the case at the Appeal Court here in Kaduna.” Kaduna Police spokesman ASP Muhammad Jalige could not be reached as at the time filing the report as his mobile was switched off.
