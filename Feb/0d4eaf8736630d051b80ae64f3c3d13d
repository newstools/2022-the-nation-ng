An expectant mother has allegedly collected over N2 million from her rich Facebook lover by pretending to have been kidnapped. Jamila Ardo was said to have kept the transaction from her husband while giving her well-off internet suitor the impression that she would marry him. It was learnt yesterday that Jamila managed to get the internet sweetheart to spend heavily on her. She reportedly arranged her own kidnap with connivance of a man simply named Abdulaziz, who contacted the Facebook boyfriend, Adamu Ahmed, telling him that she had been kidnapped. After the negotiation handled at Jamila’s end by Abdulaziz, Adamu deposited the money in a bank account which he was given. After that, Jamila told Adamu that she had been freed by her captors. But our correspondent learnt that Adamu became suspicious after a while, and notified the police.

They eventually apprehended the owner of the account named Amina Mohammed. Amina Mohammed reportedly told the police that her friend, Jamila, requested for her account number so that somebody would send in money for her. The 25-year-old Jamila has been taken into police custody for kidnapping herself and collecting N2.076 million as ransom from Adamu Ahmed. She pleaded not guilty when she was arraigned before a chief magistrate court in Yola charged with criminal conspiracy and kidnapping. After the not-guilty plea, police prosecutor Abubakar Nurudeen prayed Magistrate Abdullahi Mohammed Digil to adjourn the matter to enable the prosecution forward the case file to the director of public prosecution for legal advice. Magistrate Digil adjourned the case till March 10.
