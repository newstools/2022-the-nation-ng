Coleman Technical Industries Limited (CTIL), a manufacturer of wires and cables, has fully repaid its Series 1 Commercial Paper (CP) issuance to investors. In a statement signed by its Managing Director, Mr. George Onafowokan, the company stated that it promptly fulfilled its obligation on the Series 1 CP issued for 180 days, which matured on January 10, 2022, and informed FMDQ Securities Exchange Plc of the payment in line with best practice. Coleman accessed the CP market for the first-time last year, in a bid to increasingly diversify its funding structure to ensure it continues to provide good quality cables at competitive prices to its customers. With a successful outing, the Series 1 CP issuance attracted high net worth individuals, asset managers, insurance companies and pension fund administrators.
