The Borno State Emergency Management Agency has confirmed three deaths in Saturday’s fire at the Muna El-Badawy Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) camp in Maiduguri. According to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), its Director-General, Hajiya Yabawa Kolo, confirmed the death toll during an impact assessment visit to the scene. She said at least 3,000 shelters were destroyed while dozens of households in the camp were displaced. She said the fire, which began from a tent, gutted other shelters because there was no immediate fire service response in the camp at the time of the incident. Kolo noted that fire outbreaks in camps and communities where returned IDPs had been resettled were becoming a regular occurrence.
