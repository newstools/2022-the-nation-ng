Israel said on Sunday that it could halt Israeli airlines’ flights to Dubai in the next few days due to a dispute over security arrangements, but is looking at rerouting them to Abu Dhabi instead. An Israeli official said current security arrangements for three Israeli airlines that fly into Dubai International Airport – El Al, Israir and Arkia – were due to expire on Tuesday, leaving negotiators 48 hours to find a solution. Direct flights from Israel to the United Arab Emirates began after the two countries’ formalised ties in 2020. Hundreds of thousands of Israelis have since visited the Gulf state.

The Dubai government’s media office did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Emirati state carrier, Flydubai, would be likely to benefit if Israeli carriers stop flying to Dubai as it operates direct flights to Tel Aviv. Spokespeople for El Al and Israir said their flights to Dubai were on schedule, for now. Arkia had no immediate comment. (Reuters/NAN)
