The Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) has raised the alarm over persistent vandalisation of rail tracks across the country. NRC Managing Director Fidet Okhiria stated this while addressing reporters yesterday at the corporation’s headquarters in Lagos. He said: “We called this press conference to call attention to the increasing rate of vandalisation of some of our lines by hoodlums across the country. It is becoming alarming and very serious. It is our desire to reiterate that we need to maintain what we have and keep it working rather than destroy it and go back to where we were before.” Okhiria, who said the removal of the rail tracks were hitherto restricted to the narrow gauge, said the hoodlums have become so daring that they have started attacking the standard gauge, removing the clips with the intention to remove the tracks.

Okhiria said: “The rate of vandalisation of our infrastructure is becoming alarming and very serious. I don’t want to mention particular regions but people are sabotaging the tracks so badly. We have had issues between Papalanto and Abeokuta. We have had issues close to Ajaokuta, of people trying to vandalise the tracks and even the coaches. “Last week, they attacked out train en route Ajaokuta station. There was an attack affecting some passengers. We should let the world know that this bad set of people is not allowed to thrive in Nigeria.” SPONSORED
