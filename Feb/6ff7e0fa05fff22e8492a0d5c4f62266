French President Emmanuel Macron held separate phone calls with his Russian and Ukrainian counterparts on Monday in a bid to stop the bloodshed in Ukraine. Macron spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy “several” times and also had an hour-and-a-half-long phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who he urged to “end the Russian offensive against Ukraine,” Macron’s office said. Macron “reaffirmed the need to implement an immediate ceasefire” in his call with Putin, and called for a “halt to all strikes and attacks against civilians and places of residence” while discussions are going on between the two countries.
