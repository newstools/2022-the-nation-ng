That is a core belief in the tenet of this religion. So, if you believe that Jesus Christ is coming back now, how can you be saving for tomorrow? “That means, if you believe Jesus Christ is coming tomorrow, you still don’t believe because you are planning for tomorrow. Your bank account is evidence of that. Once you have a bank account it means you don’t believe that Jesus Christ is coming now. Somewhere in your heart there is doubt, you are like me, and we are going to the same place. “Don’t come and preach to me, live by the day. Abrahamic religions are religions of now. You cannot be planning for tomorrow when you claim to believe that Jesus Christ is coming now,” he concluded.
