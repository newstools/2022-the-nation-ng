The Aare Onakakanfo of Yoruba land, Chief Gani Adams has stressed the need for Nigeria to go back to regionalism ahead of the 2023 polls. Speaking during the Oodua Progressive Union (OPU) 10th year anniversary, book presentation and grand reception at the Vantage Point, Lagos, Adams said Nigerians have wasted their time by drifting from regionalism in 1966 to a unified system of government. He said: “As the global Convener of OPU, I am of the view that Nigeria must duly be restructured along regionalism. A country of over 250 million people cannot make progress with the existing structure. There is a need for Nigeria to go back to regionalism. Regionalism allows the federating units to develop at their own pace.

We have wasted our resources and lost our glory; the federal government pretends to control almost hundred percent of the power, reducing the influence of the states and the local governments. In 1963, our political leader wrote a constitution of the people that was not being infiltrated by any government, it is called republic constitution, if we can draw many things from the content of that constitution, it will help a lot.” The OPU also presented a book where its history is documented titled: OPU: globalising Yoruba values and culture. - Advertisement - Adams stated that they decided to write their story to set the record straight and rid themselves of unnecessary misinterpretations of history.
