Liverpool staged a second-half comeback against a resilient Norwich side to keep their Premier League title hopes alive with an eighth successive win in all competitions. The Reds had threatened the Norwich goal countless times but they were stunned into emergency action moments after the interval when Milot Rashica’s deflected strike gave the Canaries hope of a first win at Anfield in 28 years. Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp, who made seven changes to the side that won at Inter Milan in the Champions League in midweek, intervened to make attacking changes on 62 minutes and within four minutes his side had turned the game around.
