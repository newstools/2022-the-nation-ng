The Oba of Benin, Omo ‘N’ Oba N’edo, Ewuare 11, said yesterday that the Benin people were writing their history by themselves for proper presentation of issues and events. He said many accounts of the history and people of ancient Benin kingdom were written by others, who chronicled things from outsiders’ perspective. The monarch said it was time they wrote their history by themselves for posterity. He spoke at the palace of Alake of Egbaland in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, after presenting a -7kg book – an anthropology containing short history of Benin, to the Alake of Egbaland, Oba Adedotun Gbadebo.
