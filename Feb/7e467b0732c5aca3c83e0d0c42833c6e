At the end of last year, some 4.75 million telecommunications users were cut-off from the networks in the country, according to the latest subscription statistics released by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) yesterday. This appeared to be a carryover from what happened the previous year when over eight million telephone lines were cut off the network. According to the latest subscription statistics, the December data showed that the country ended 2021 with 195.5 million active telephone lines. The country began 2021 with 200.2 million telephone users. As at the period, the sector contended with the enrollment and verification of the National Identification Number (NIN) to Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) cards policy imposed by the Federal Government, weak consumer purchasing power and Average Revenue Per User (ARPU). These challenges, combined with COVID-19, slowed subscribers capability at the time. Specifically, the 200.2 million subscribers in January 2021 dropped to 196 million in February and further slumped to 192.4 million in March 2021.   ‘Using data key to transforming SMEs’     Lagos to hold summit on youth unemployment     Deel: technology boosts hiring   - Advertisement - By April, the figure dropped further to 188.7 million and to 187 million in May.
