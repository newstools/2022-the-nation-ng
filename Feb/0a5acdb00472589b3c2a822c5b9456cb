Akwa Ibom State Governor Udom Emmanuel has said his choice of Pastor Umo Eno as his successor has not created division in the state chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). He spoke at the weekend during the 10th series of “The governor speaks” programme aired live on the state-owned and private radio stations operating in the state, monitored by The Nation in Uyo. The governor re-echoed his admonition against those who desired power by use of violence, saying he would not be distracted. He said he would rather remain focused on his agenda.   ‘Why Isoko North should allow South to produce…     Northern governors mourn Sardauna’s grandson Hassan…     Emir of Nasarawa hails NYSC D-G over museum   Emmanuel said: “As a leader I am entitled to only one vote during the primaries and general election. And that my vote is not for violence, it is not for the man that will go and carry gun and point on your head to grab power. - Advertisement - “Whoever grabs power by violence will rule by violence. So I am telling you that my vote is for peace, it is for progress, it is for economic prosperity, for infrastructural development, unity and I can keep counting. “So our party, the PDP, is not divided. Those social media things we read are not helping us in any matter. I don’t follow those things, I must get focused; I don’t need those distractions.” On his promise to complete ongoing projects before the end of his tenure, including road infrastructure, the governor said that his administration was doing everything to ensure that was achieved. He thanked God that his administration completed some of the capital projects it started despite the recession in the country and the negative effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy.
