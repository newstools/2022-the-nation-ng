A Professor of Industrial Relations and Human Resource Management, Yunus Dauda, has said introduction of technologies have led to reduction of workers in all sectors. He spoke yesterday at Lagos State University (LASU) 83rd inaugural lecture, “Managing Technology Challenges: Workers, Employers and Government Perspective.” Dauda said technology had profited investors more and lowered income of middle and low income workers. Changes in technology he said, had increased unemployment which further aggravated poverty.   ‘Denounce people distracting you’     Fed Govt: we’ll become world’s largest in cocoa     Pat Utomi advocates effective leadership   he Professor said technological development has not made the Human resources irrelevant, saying that people are still the only appreciating asset in business that you can challenge their desire and innate experience. - Advertisement - He further said that workers and people globally, should be the beneficiaries of technology change rather than its victims. “New technologies and the sciences that underlie them are the products of a world wide centuries-long accumulation of knowledge and should therefore be used and managed to promote human progress and wellbeing,” he said. Dauda added that for Nigeria to benefit from global technology, resources and policies of the government should be directed to improve technological innovation for improved organizational performance and national development.
