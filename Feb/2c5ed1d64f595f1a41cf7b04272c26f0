I’ve always been a funny person. When I got to UNIPORT, my friends wanted me to try comedy well. “I studied Linguistics and Communication at UNIPORT but at 100 level I was given a change of course form to change to Theatre arts from the HOD then, but I did accept because my father wanted me to study Law at the beginning. “My father wanted me to be a Lawyer, not even that Linguistics and Communication that I studied. He told me nothing but law. So from school shows, we found our way here.”
