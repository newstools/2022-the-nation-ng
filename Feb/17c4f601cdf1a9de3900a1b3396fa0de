CEO, Sportsville Communication Services Ltd,  Frank Ilaboya, is excited with the widespread acceptance of the annual Sportsville Recognition Awards. Ilaboya stated as much ahead of awards ceremony, which holds February 13. “I’m excited with the reviews the award is getting within such a short time,” Ilaboya said. “When we started the project last year, little did we know that we would be getting this huge followership within such a short period. “The reason behind the award, like we stated during the maiden edition, was to recognise  and appreciate personalities who have contributed in no small way to the growth and development of  sports over the years. We recognise that such appreciation will not only give them inner satisfaction, it will also spur them to do more while also encouraging others to follow their steps.
