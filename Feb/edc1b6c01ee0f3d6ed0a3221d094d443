NIMC said following the full restoration of the portal, customers and service providers can now take full advantage of the two verification platforms – Tokenization and NVS – which  are both effective for verification and authentication of the National Identification Number.” A statement signed by NIMC head of Corporate Communications, Mr Kayode Adegoke, expressed “its profound gratitude to the general public and partners for their support during the NVS downtime and use of the tokenization platform.” SPONSORED
