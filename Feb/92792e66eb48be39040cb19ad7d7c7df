There’s no nation in the land where there are no challenges. No matter the crisis we’ve had in this country, God is still interested in our nation. We thank God for his interest in our nation. I know that God has Nigeria in his plan. He has been good towards this nation, despite all the challenges. “God is the creator of man, and is the one that knows the mind of man. So, it is better to talk to God who knows man to give us a leader. A self-appointed leader in 2023 is not advised. God will give us a leader of his choice.” - Advertisement - The cleric noted that the church’s Special Power Touch Programme would be held on February 18, at the Velodrome of the MKO Abiola Stadium. “God gave me the mandate to deliver, rescue, restore, and protect believers with mobile fire.
