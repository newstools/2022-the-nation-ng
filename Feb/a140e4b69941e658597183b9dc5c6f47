At least two policemen guarding the member representing Nkanu West and Nkanu East Federal Constituency, Nnoli Nnaji, were killed yesterday during the local government elections in Enugu State. Six other persons, including three unidentified persons suspected to the hoodlums, were also killed. Efforts to reach the lawmaker were unsuccessful at press time. However, sources told our correspondent that the policemen were attacked at the home of the lawmaker at Akpugo in Nkanu West Council where they were shot dead. The gunmen also set ablaze vehicles parked in the house of the federal lawmaker. In the same community, a vehicle belonging to a councillorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), was equally torched by the hoodlums, who had earlier attacked Obeagu Amaechi in Enugu South Local Government.

The gunmen made away with the station’s utility vehicle and camera as well as the phones, cash and other valuables belonging to some journalists in the vehicle. The hoodlums were said to have used the ESBS bus to enter voting centre premises  without suspicion and disrupted the exercise by destroying electoral materials after chasing away voters. Eyewitnesses said the gunmen were heard shouting that they had warned that there should no longer be elections in any part of the Southeast. Contacted, police command spokesman Daniel Ndukwe told our correspondent to call him back, as he was busy. Besides the attack on the polling units, the election was generally peaceful across the state, with impressive turnout of voters across the 17 local governments.
