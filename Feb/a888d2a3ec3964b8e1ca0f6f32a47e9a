Super Eagles striker Umar Sadiq has staged a comeback into the La Liga SmartBank highest scorer race after his brace handed Almeria a 2-1 win over Mirandes on Sunday night. Umar’s two goals have now taken him to the fifth spot behind the trio of Ruben Castro (Cartagena), Cristhian Stuani (Girona), and Borja Baston (Real Oviedo) who are on 15 goals as well as 14-goal Eibar’s Stoichkov. The former Partizan Belgrade striker with 12 goals from 23 games is only three goals away from catching up despite playing fewer games because of his involvement with the national team in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations hosted by Cameroon. Umar will hope to be on the scoresheet when Almeria face Fuenlabrada in another league tie on Friday.
