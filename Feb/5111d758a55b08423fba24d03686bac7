I was literally palpitating, questioning myself if I’m ready for this and what are people doing… people that you thought were really in love and had been together for seven years couldn’t live one year together. I just switched to my God energy because he created marriage and he knows marriage so I’m relying on him to teach me”, said Nze. - Advertisement - I’ve always known that I like my private life to be my private life even though you cannot be so private but you can control the narrative. It was even going to be under the wraps until I went for my honeymoon but she was like can we just post a picture so they won’t think I’ve gone to marry somebody’s husband or people will now post one picture that we are not looking our best so let us control the narrative which was why I posted the picture. “We’ve been together for three and half years but only people that are close to us knew. Some people said “oh we thought you guys are friends but of course it is Nollywood and you don’t want to overshow emotions outside so we decided to keep things to ourselves and I think it kind of worked and even till now I don’t want to be a social media husband.” SPONSORED
