The Federal Government on Monday urged filmmakers to avoid money ritual contents in their movies. This follows the recent confession of a money ritualist that he learnt the act from social media. Speaking during a media sensitisation visit to Daily Trust Head Office in Abuja, Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, said: “To mitigate this, I have directed the National Film and Video Censors Board, the body set up to regulate the film and video industry in Nigeria, to take this issue into consideration while performing its role of censoring and classifying films and videos. “I have also directed NFVCB to engage with stakeholders in the film industry in order to express the concerns of the government and Nigerians on the need to eschew money ritual content in their movies.” He added: “Many have also blamed Nollywood for featuring money rituals in some of its movies, saying this has negatively influenced the vulnerable youth.

Of course, you are also aware of a case involving a female student of the University of Jos who was allegedly killed by her boyfriend for ritual purposes. These killings have been widely reported by the media.” Mohammed said the government won’t allow the social media space to be suffused with dangerous contents, adding the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari won’t relent in its efforts to ensure responsible use of social media.   SPONSORED
