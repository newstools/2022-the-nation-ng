WHISTLE BLOWERS need to be protected against unforeseen circumstances. This is part of deliberation at Southwest zonal conference on the Whistleblower Policy, organised by Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning at the Adeyemi Bero Auditorium, Alausa in Ikeja. Minister of Finance Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, represented by the Permanent Secretary (Special Duties) Shehu Shinkafi, said the conference was to sensitise people on the need to uphold and strengthen the policy.   ‘Youths targets for subversive influence, others’     Assembly promises to intervene in communal crisis     ‘Boys deserve attention too’   She noted that the policy followed the Federal Government’s resolve to fight corruption, which is one of the campaign promises of President Muhammadu Buhari in 2015. “The Southwest zonal conference is therefore historic because of the importance of Lagos as the economic hub of the country, especially since majority of private sector investments are domicilled in the state. “The goal of the policy is to strengthen the fight against financial crimes and corruption by revealing information on financial crimes and rewarding whistle blowers,” she noted. Representative of Inspector-General of Police AIG Adeleke Adeyinka noted there should be a law to protect them against discriminatory or retaliatory action.
