A group, Concerned Northern Forum (CNF), has rescinded its earlier call for the removal of the management of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation Limited (NNPC). According to the statement by CNF’s Chairman, Mallam Ibrahim Bature and spokesperson, Comrade Abdulsalam Moh’d Kazeem, the CNF based its new position on the “new information at our disposal and the attempts by certain special interests to hijack our demand and use our position to blackmail the present NNPC management over the current artificial PMS scarcity occasioned by marketers dispensing fewer pumps at a time”.

Besides, the group commended the management of the NNPC for taking prompt action by alerting the nation on the toxic fuel and for taking measured steps to recall the bad product and injecting over 700 million litres of petrol with a promise of additional 2.1billion litres to address the shortfall. It called on the regulatory and security agencies to ensure that fuel stations sell at the maximum installed capacity and in the event any station is found to be sabotaging the government’s effort, the product be dispensed free to motorists and such station sealed. “We withdraw our notice for the sack of the NNPC management and nationwide protest but remain committed to the sanctioning of the importing companies and their officials,” it said.
