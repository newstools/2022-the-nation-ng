Victor Osimhen managed to secure at least a point for Napoli last night following a tough draw in Sardinia against Cagliari, reports football-italia.net. The Partenopei found themselves 1-0 down after a second half goal from Gaston Pereiro, but they didn’t give up and eventually their hard work was rewarded, when Osimhen headed home a Mario Rui cross to tie things up in Sardinia, securing an important point for the title race. Napoli kicked off the match but it was Cagliari who started on the front foot, settling into the match quicker and having the majority of the early possession. They had a few chances in the first half before the Partenopei finally woke up and had a few of their own. Despite the electric flow of the game, things were goalless heading into the half-time break. Both teams had taken four shots each in the first 45 minutes.
