Reality TV star Lucy Essien has taken a swipe at ‘unbelievers’ over her ‘32’ years of age. Essien was among the 20 housemates who contested in the BBNaija Lockdown season 5 edition and the tenth to be evicted from the house in her time. While it’s a tradition for housemates to state their age in the course of applying for a slot on the show, however, many who watched the reality show have continued to doubt Lucy’s age which read 30 as of 2020. She said: “Some people’s logic is so messed up. So, I want to claim age, I did not see younger age to claim? I will now claim 32!”   How I almost missed my convocation, by Obi Cubana     NDLEA picks up Marlian music acts as Naira Marley reacts     Thugs imported to disrupt Osun PDP primary, Davido alleges   Baffled at the fact that she could have claimed a lesser age but didn’t, she said: “Not as if I’m claiming 22, 24, 26, 28! I didn’t claim any of those. “I claimed 32! In other words, I’m still old. So, what the f*ck?! At least by your standard. But I am not older than your mother so, what the f*ck? Get off my back, okay? Urging critics to mind their business, the media personality said: “You guys didn’t give birth to me. I can decide to be 100 years if I want to. I can decide to be 2 years old today if I want to. It’s not your business. Lucy added: “As long as you ain’t feeding me, I don’t think it’s your problem. It’s not even your place to say someone is so-so age or not. It’s not your damn business. “Go and mind the business that pays you. I am not the cause of your problem like I always say.”
