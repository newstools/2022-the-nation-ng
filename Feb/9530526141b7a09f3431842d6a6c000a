Kaduna Governor Mallam Nasir El-Rufai has argued the only way to end terrorism is through the total elimination of terrorists. The Governor spoke at the weekly ministerial briefing by the Presidential Media Team in Abuja. He stated the Fulanis involved in criminality will never abandon the business on their own because they make far more money from it than from legitimate cattle businesses. According to him, some Governors had the impression that negotiating with terrorists would end the problem but later realised it was a mistake. He revealed Northwest State Governments began the process of cooperation and co-financing military operations against cattle rustling.

He also lamented lack of capacity of security agencies in terms of adequate personnel and equipment, stressing the need to recruit more hands and procure sufficient equipment. He expressed delight over the recent declaration of banidts as terrorists by a court ruling. El-Rufai said to deal with terrorism permanently, there must be simultaneous ground and air attacks in all the States where the terrorists are hiding to prevent them from escaping. He said the locations of the terrorists are known, saying that they must be wiped out at once rather than the current piecemeal approach.
