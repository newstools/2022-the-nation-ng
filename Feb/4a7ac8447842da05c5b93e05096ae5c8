Veteran actress Rita Edochie has reiterated the call for the release of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB’s) leader, Nnamdi Kanu. Edochie, who has shown no sign of backing down in her call for Kanu’s release, said neither he nor Nollywood was responsible for the problems in the country. According to her, leaders are the problems with Nigeria claiming they created nearly all the challenges in the nation. She called on the FG to release Kanu and face their ‘self-inflicted” problems. On her Instagram page, the thespian posted a musical video chiefly to extol the IPOB leader and his works.
