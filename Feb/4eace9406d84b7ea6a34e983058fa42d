I do not know where I can go yet but he has infinite potential. In the last match he made a lot of tears taking back all the defense. He is also a very generous striker, and sometimes he makes mistakes because he runs a lot,” Spalletti told the club’s official website. - Advertisement - “The team must help him and he must help himself to optimize his quality. We have a group with many champions and everyone knows what they have to do to help each other and continue on this path of growth.” In a related development, former Napoli coach  Edy Reja has described Osimhen as a valuable player. “When he (Osimhen) leaves, no one takes him. Sure, a bit of an anarchist he is, but how can such a guy be caged?” Reja told Tuttomercatoweb. “ It can’t be done, you have to keep up with his tears, you have to let everyone close to him adapt. However, due to his overwhelming strength, it is worth putting yourself at the service of someone so strong.” SPONSORED
