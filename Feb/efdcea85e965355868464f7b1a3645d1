The Brazilian international Neymar, who is under contract at Ligue 1’s PSG through June 2025, said on a podcast he’s more keen to play in MLS than return to his native Brazil.  “I don’t know, I have some doubts about that. I don’t know if I’ll play in Brazil again,” Neymar said. “I’d love to play in the U.S. actually. I’d love to play there at least for a season.” When pressed further, Neymar cited a shorter season in MLS than in Europe, which would allow him more vacation time and elongate his career. However, with the Audi MLS Cup Playoffs, teams can play for upwards of 10 months. “I’d play many more years,” he said laughing. This isn’t the first time the 30-year-old has hinted at an MLS move. Two years ago, David Beckham made a pitch of sorts to Neymar in a one-on-one interview for Otro.

It’s going to be a contract for Miami for 10 years’ time,” the Inter Miami CF co-owner said. After Beckham joked Miami weren’t “going to pay much,” they smiled, shook hands and said “deal.” Neymar said off-camera, “I told him I will play there one day.” Neymar originally turned pro in 2009 with Santos before signing with FC Barcelona in 2013. His move to PSG in 2017 for €222 million stands as the most expensive transfer fee in global soccer history. With Seleção, Neymar is their second all-time leading scorer. His 70 goals only trail Pele’s 77. SPONSORED
