Gareth Bale made his first club appearance in nearly six months – and struck the crossbar – as Real Madrid drew 0-0 at Villarreal in La Liga. The Wales international had not played for Madrid since their 1-0 win at Real Betis on 28 August. The 32-year-old went closest to firing the visitors in front when he rattled the crossbar early in the second half. Villarreal’s Arnaut Danjuma struck the post in the first half, while Real’s Luka Jovic also hit the bar late on.
