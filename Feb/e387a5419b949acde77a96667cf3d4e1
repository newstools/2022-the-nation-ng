Filmmaking company, Aforevo has said that its recently launched screen writer’s competition is aimed at empowering promising screenwriters. According to the organiser, Lawrence Onuzulike, Nollywood Screenwriting Contest (NSWC) will empower screenwriters, who partake in the competition with a star prize of One million naira to be won. Onuzulike noted that empowerment doesn’t stop at winning the money. He also assured that the winning script would be made into a Nollywood movie with a one-year scriptwriting contract with Aforevo. “Nollywood screenwriting contest was created to reward hard-working screen screenwriters and highlight the vital roles they play in film making. In Nollywood, there’s this overall feeling that screenwriters, despite playing very important roles in film making, are not being well recognized and rewarded in the Nigerian film industry”, said Onuzulike.

This is one of its kinds of a project and has never been done on this scale in Nigeria.” He further disclosed that entries are open to interested persons between February 7, 2022, and February 24, 2022. Judges for the competition include veteran actress, Clarion Chuckuwra, Segun Arinze, President Directors Guild of Nigeria, Victor Okhai, and Script Writers Guild of Nigeria, Yinka Ogun.
