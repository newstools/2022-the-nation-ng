Nigerian equities were the contrarians at the weekend as the global stock markets panicked over the escalating crisis between Russia and Ukraine. Russia attacked Ukraine last week and continued a major aggressive push of what it called special military operation to demilitarise and ‘denazify’ Ukraine by destroying the latter’s military capabilities. Russia vetoed a United Nation’s resolution deploring the attack and has threatened never-seen dire consequences for any foreign country that interferes. The United States, Britain and European Union have unveiled a bouquet of sanctions against Russia, the world’s second largest supplier of crude oil. Gasoline prices shot up in many global economic hubs amidst anxiety over the escalation of the crisis. Nigeria’s benchmark equities index closed weekend with an average return of 0.40 per cent, equivalent to net capital gains of N101 billion.

Analysts at Cordros Securities said they expected corporate earnings and dividends to drive activities at the stock market this week. “As things stand, we believe investors have fully priced-in dividend expectations. Hence, we think positive surprises from dividend-paying stocks would provide a catalyst for increased buying activities. Notwithstanding, we advise investors to seek trading opportunities in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings,” Cordros Securities stated. Analysts at Cowry Asset Management said they expected the equities market to witness speculative buys ahead of year end corporate releases particular for companies which opted for 60-days filing option. “ Overall, we anticipate that the bourse will close in the bullish territory,” Cowry Asset stated in a weekend investment note.
