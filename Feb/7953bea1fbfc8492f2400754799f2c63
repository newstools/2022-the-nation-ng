Kwara State Government has said that more than a cumulative sum of N5 billion of public funds and loans secured with the government as guarantor was sunk into the Shonga Farms agricultural project by past administrations, with no traces of any dividends to the people of the state. It added that the state had been fraudulently negotiated into underwriting the debts incurred by the former administrations in the name of Shonga Farm. Shonga Farm is a venture that was funded 100 per cent at inception with taxpayers’ money without any gain accruing to the people of the state under whatever guise.

It explained that the reason AMCON took over the Kwara properties in Abuja is to recover the bad loans that the Farm owes a consortium of banks that invested in it dating back to 2007 because the Shonga Farm Holdings could not pay back on the agreed timeline.
