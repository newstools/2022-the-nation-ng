A pressure group, Patriotic Elders Network (PEN) has called on Nigerians to focus on the performance of individual politicians and not their region come 2023 general elections. The group said Nigerians should not be bothered about the region that the next President comes from, as long as he is able to perform. Founder PEN, Dr. Bature Abdulaziz said the group was created to prevent elders in the country from simply sitting, watching and folding their arms while people soil the good name of the nation. He said the group intends to write Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to cancel any politician caught buying votes or encouraging youths to partake in any form of violence.

He said, “Nigeria is our country, we have no other country to call our own than this, so we need to ensure its growth and not support people trying to tear it apart for their own benefits. “Come 2023, the elders in this country will not support a party but the individual that will perform. We are calling on Nigerians to ignore party affiliation, region and concentrate on a person that will perform and get us out of the predicament that the country has found itself.”
