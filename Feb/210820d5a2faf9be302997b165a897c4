Absence of Justice Donatus Okorowo of a Federal High Court, Abuja, on Thursday, stalled the hearing of a suit filed by a group against the police over the suspension of DCP Abba Kyari. Although counsel to the applicant, the Incorporated Trustees of Northern Peace Foundation, Hamza N’Dantani, was in court, the court registrar apologised over the inability of the judge to sit. The matter, which was on number six on the cause list, was however fixed for April 4 for hearing. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) also reports that the matter could not proceed, on Jan. 12, due to the absence of counsel to the plaintiff and the respondents in the suit. Justice Okorowo then adjourned the matter until today for hearing.
