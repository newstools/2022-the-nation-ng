Billionaire business mogul Obi Cubana is trending on the microblogging app, Twitter after the arrest of the suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police Abba Kyari. He was arrested alongside four others on Monday over alleged illicit drug links. The arrest came hours after the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) declared him wanted over alleged drug links. After Kyari’s arrest, the Chairman of Cubana Group has begun to trend on Twitter. Many argued the popular nightlife boss may just be the target of the NDLEA seeing he was reportedly grilled by operatives of the agency on January 13 over alleged drug ties. - Advertisement - It was reportedly alleged that suspicious payments were made into Cubana’s account by three convicted drug dealers from Malaysia, Nigeria and India. Some others hoped Obi Cubana was not involved in drug trafficking as it is no news that the duo has a good rapport.
