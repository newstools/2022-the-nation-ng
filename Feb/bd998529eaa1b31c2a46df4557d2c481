Napoli doctor Gianpaolo Tartaro has expressed his elation with the speed of Victor Osimhen’s recovery, and he stated that the Nigerian talisman could soon be able to play without using a face mask. The Nigeria international sustained a severe facial injury when he collided with Milan Skriniar in their 3-2 loss to Inter Milan in the Serie A last November. Because of the injury, the 23-year-old had to undergo an operation, and he was ruled out of action for two to three months. Though his time on the sidelines was cut short after a face mask was designed for him, Osimhen still missed out on the Africa Cup of Nations. However, he played 20 minutes of action two weeks ago in Napoli’s 2-0 victory over Bologna and underwent a check-up on Tuesday.

Fortunately, the supports on which we have downloaded can be modified because the callus has formed.” “We have also listened to his requests to open the view a little. We have enlarged his eyeball, both the upper and lower part.” “Surely, the mask gives him some difficulty but is the only thing that allows him to play. “Until the end of February, he will certainly wear a mask, then after the control scan, it will be decided whether he can take it off or continue to wear it in March,” Tartaro added.
