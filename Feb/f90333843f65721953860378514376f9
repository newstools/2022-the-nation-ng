The Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) yesterday denied paying N20 billion to ghost contractors. The commission urged Nigerians to disregard “these self-seeking elements and the concocted figments of their blurred imagination.” A statement by the Director, Corporate Affairs of the NDDC, Dr. Ibitoye Abosede, described as untrue the spurious publication in some dailies and online news channels by some Ijaw youth groups.

This is not only laughable, but also most unfortunate. - Advertisement - “The public is hereby put on notice that these spurious lies are being masterminded, fabricated and orchestrated by persons who are positioning their relatives and associates for ultimate appointment into the board of the NDDC.”   SPONSORED
