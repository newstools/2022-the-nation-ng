Rapper, Erhiga Agarivbie aka Erigga has tipped men on the only criteria for which any girl should receive a gift on the forthcoming lover’s day, February 14. While many lovers anticipate Valentine’s Day to receive and give gifts, the Warri-based artiste said no girl should be given any gift if she doesn’t have a PVC (Permanent Voters Card). He made this known recently on his Twitter handle. “Let no man buy gift give any girl on Valentine’s Day unless she get her PVC”, he tweeted.
