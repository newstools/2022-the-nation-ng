The Bola Ahmed Tinubu (BAT) Vanguard has said the former Lagos State governor will bring his wealth of experience to solve national issues. The convener of BAT Vanguard, Sola Olofin, stated this while fielding questions from journalists. Olofin examined how Tinubu intervened to ensure the party holds its National Convention on February 26. Olofin said: “He (Tinubu) has been making frantic efforts to ensure there is no rancour in the party, being the leader of the APC. So far, he has been able to organise peaceful meetings with the necessary arms of the party whom I perceive are in an amicable solution towards ensuring that the convention would hold peacefully. I want to believe that this is one of his efforts in ensuring that the party holds a smooth convention.

If you look critically at some western countries, particularly America, their President is of age, and also some of the African countries. They have Presidents that are of age, and I believe that the older you are, the more experience you have to handle the national issue, and also ensure that rule of law is well taken care of.” Co-convener of BAT Vanguard Sola Gabriel, said their principal was in full support of recent moves of the party to review its constitution. He said: “As you can see, the last constitution amendment took place in 2014. It has been overtaken by time. New things need to be accommodated into it. That’s why our constitution needs to be reviewed to accommodate new happenings to make the party move forward.”   SPONSORED
