I used that period to my advantage and decided to focus more on my music,” said Shady Blue. “I’m a mother of two boys and I work as well. I’m a program manager in an information technology firm, but I’m a musician first because that’s the way I was born. It’s in my blood and I’m also a business owner. The business didn’t actually happen until COVID started and since then, I’ve released a lot of songs in the last two years. I’m focusing more on my music now because my kids are at the age where I can afford to focus on music fully and I am back home to promote a couple of my songs,” she said. Aboderin further revealed that her new single which features Neo Phlames is already receiving massive airplay with lots of buzz in the Nigerian entertainment space.   SPONSORED
