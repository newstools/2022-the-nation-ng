Music superstar Davido has alleged thugs have been imported to disrupt the Osun PDP primary slated for Saturday, March 7, 2022. The Nation had reported that Davido had launched a scathing criticism at his cousin Bamidele Adeleke, who declared his interest to run in the 2022 Osun gubernatorial election on Twitter. Davido, a strong supporter of his uncle, Ademola Adeleke, who is contesting the primary, however, assured everything was under control. The singer tweeted: “It has been brought to my attention that certain individuals have imported thugs and their mercenaries to our dear state to intimidate delegates, I will like to reassure Imole supporters and All Adhoc delegates that there is nothing to fear.   2023 president: APC zoning tilts ticket in South’s favour     What I’ll do to any woman that comes close to my ‘property’…     PDP Congress: Police confirm killing of one person in Iwo   “I appreciate the fact that great PDP members are resolute and have trooped out en-mass to defend the process. In the Imole camp, all we want and are clamoring for is a free and fair ad-Hoc congress election. “We believe in the national leadership ably led by Distinguished Senator Ayu under whose leadership the ad hoc congress is being conducted, to do a thorough job that represents the wish of the Adhoc Delegates and PDP members in Osun state @OfficialPDPNig” “ADAGUNODO OF OSUN PDP RESPECT D COURT !!!
