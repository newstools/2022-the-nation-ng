There was tension yesterday in Ede town, the host community of Federal Polytechnic, Osun State, as students went on the rampage to protest the killing of a prospective corps member and a commercial motorcyclist. The Nation gathered that the prospective corps member, Hassan, had just graduated from the institution, but was still in the community to tidy up his clearance before proceeding for the compulsory youth service. A resident of the community, Kabiru, told our correspondent that “Hassan and the motorcyclist were shot several times at Bode, via Agbalemobode, around 10pm on Wednesday. “On Thursday morning, students thronged the streets and made bonfires at junctions. They were so violent in their protest. Shops and businesses were closed down around the campus because the students attacked residents.” The polytechnic spokesman, Sola Lawal, confirmed the incident.
