A former Commissioner for Commerce and Industry in Ondo State, Mr. Akin Akingbesote, has said that he and others joined the Tinubu Support Organisation (TSO) to ensure the presidential ambition of a former Lagos Governor, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, becomes a reality. Akingbesote, who spoke in Akure at the inauguration of local government coordinators of TSO in Ondo State, described Tinubu as the only candidate that has the capacity to win the 2023 election for the APC. He boasted that Tinubu would win the APC primary owing to the array of personalities that are backing the Tinubu project. The former Commissioner said Tinubu has genuine humanitarian interest and personified nucleus of Nigeria politics. He said: “Our desire to follow Tinubu was based on his various activities and the way he handled the APC to take power in 2015.”   BREAKING: Sunday Igboho will be released soon – Lawyer     UPDATED: Ex-Gov Oni, supporters dump PDP for Ekiti 2022     Army plotting execution of detained Obigbo youths, IPOB…   - Advertisement - Director General of TSO, Aminu Sulaiman, said the northerners were in the lead for Tinubu’s presidential bid to pay him back for supporting Buhari to power in 2015.
