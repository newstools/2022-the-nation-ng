The cost of feeding a child per day under the Federal Government’s National Home-Grown School Feeding has increased to N100 from N70, it was learnt yesterday. National Coordinator of National Social Investments Programme (NSIP) Umar Bindir spoke at a two-day National Consultative meeting on public food procurement in Abuja.   ‘Youths targets for subversive influence, others’     ‘Whistleblowers should be protected’     Assembly promises to intervene in communal crisis   He said: “When we started in 2016 before COVID-19, we experienced difficulty implementing the N70 per child. We have made presentation to the minister, who made submission to the President, and Mr President has approved the raise from N70 to N100 per child. The minister of Finance is also cooperating to ensure this is implemented quickly. “We also hope the states will realise the importance of this programme meant to tackle poverty. It is not just about feeding the children, but engaging women to become entrepreneurs and good food providers. It is also about enhancing the value, the commercial and entrepreneur value of our small scale farmers.”
