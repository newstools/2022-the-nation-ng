Cuppy’s Valentine’s date, Lanre Akintomide aka A$AP Lerry, has expressed hope that their date would someday go beyond social media. He said this in an interview with Sunday Scoop over the weekend. On February 10, the disc jockey proposed a date to an Ibadan-based man ahead of Valentine’s Day celebration. The billionaire heiress, in a tweet, asked the young man if he was willing to be her valentine while suggesting they have their first date on Twitter Space because of their different locations. “Dear A$AP Lerry (@_AsiwajuLerry) Will you be my 2022 #Valentine? I know you’re in Ibadan, and I’m in Oxford but let’s meet on Twitter Space at 7pm on Feb 14th for our first date #CuppyLove,” Cuppy tweeted. - Advertisement -   Iyabo Ojo shares stunning Valentine’s Day photos     Teachers needs mental evaluation – Laura Ikeji     Bella Shmurda advises lovers’ in-view of Valentine’s Day…   This came after A$AP Lerry made a tweet inviting the “Gelato” crooner to Twitter Space on Valentine’s Day to celebrate their 2 years relationship anniversary. “I’m planning on bringing Cuppy to Twitter space on Valentine’s Day to talk to her ‘cupcakes’ and to celebrate our two years relationship anniversary,” he tweeted. Responding to Cuppy’s proposal, the Ibadan-based Twitter user gladly accepted. He wrote: “Cuppy Dat My Queen! you know your wish is my command.” Following the development, A$AP Lerry was approached and asked about his expectation of seeing the play out of events. He said: “The acceptance of the date came as a surprise to me. I really do not see this metamorphosing into a relationship because it has always been about social media sensation, which she seems good at catching. “However, I have always been a big fan of hers. Of course, this could go beyond just a virtual date. “She tweeted, ‘our first date,’ which means there is more to come, and I am ready for all of it. I don’t just have a crush on her; I am a big fan of hers.” SPONSORED
