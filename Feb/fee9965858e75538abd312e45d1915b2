The committee said: “That in view of the exponential increase in the number of law graduates from our universities and even foreign universities, coupled with the backlog that existed over the years, this legislative intervention measure is not only apt and timely but paramount; “That without prejudice to the establishment of the Law School Campus in Port-Harcourt, the provision for additional campuses in the six geopolitical zones of the federation in this Bill is appropriate as it has not tampered with the seven existing campuses p, established by administrative responsibilities of the Council of Legal Education; “That the existing campuses are overstretched and the infrastructures are not enough to accommodate thousands of law students graduating from the universities; “That apart from the statutory requirement for the creation of additional campuses, it should be strictly on the basis of need assessment and fulfilment of other indicators, such as convenience, and accessibility by lecturers, staff and students, availability of office, lecture theatre and hostel facilities, proximity to courts and law offices; and “That the Federal Government should, as a matter of priority, provide adequate resources for the funding of the infrastructural needs of the Law School campuses, across the country.”
