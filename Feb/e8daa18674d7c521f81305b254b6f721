Alternative Rock singer John Ighodaro aka Johnny Drille has appeased unmarried people with a song titled, ‘You are just single.’ The classic tunes offer motivational messages that encourage spinsters and bachelors, especially in this Valentine season. In the song, the 31-year-old singer inserts a witty line that Jesus didn’t have a Val. “Remember that Jesus didn’t have a Val. So don’t feel any pressure, just raise your head high. And look to the sky so you don’t see Girl’s and boys,” his lyrics goes.
