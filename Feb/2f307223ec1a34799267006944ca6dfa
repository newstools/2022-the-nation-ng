Rosy and Churchill are beautiful souls. “Why will people on earth criticise me for hanging out with them? “I love them, they are my friends and that’s all that matters. They equally love me. Because of that, people call me Tonto Dikeh’s enemy? Oh, really… I didn’t know. Really? They do call me that? “We are not enemies but we are not friends. We’ve never been friends. We have never had any friendship connection in the past. “Ever since I got into Nollywood, we’ve never been friends.
