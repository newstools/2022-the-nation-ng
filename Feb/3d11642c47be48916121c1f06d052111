Actress-turned-preacher Eucharia Anunobi has condemned couples, religious leaders and many others guilty of ‘immoral acts’. The evangelist, in a video shared on her Instagram page on Monday while addressing her audience, argued couples who don’t know each other’s shoe sizes are bound in ‘grave clothes’ as well as any other who is guilty of the under-listed acts. Anunobi said: “If you don’t know the shoe size of your wife or husband, you’re bound in grave clothes. If you’re still hiding your financial status, banks statements and accounts from your husband or wife. You are bound in grave clothes. “Hear me, if you’re sleeping with your housemaid or sleeping with that dirty girl that sells orange or groundnut along the street; you’re bound in grave clothes.

You say you are a lead pastor; you are still bound in grave clothes.” The grave clothes are those things that represent death to a person’s spiritual, physical, and emotional life. Importantly, grave clothes also represent unbelief or whatever holds one back from believing in Jesus and receiving salvation and eternal life. SPONSORED
