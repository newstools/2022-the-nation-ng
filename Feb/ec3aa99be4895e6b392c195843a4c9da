Speaker of Lagos State House of Assembly Mudashiru Obasa, and the lawmaker representing Eti-Osa II, Gbolahan Yishawu, have advocated earnest policy direction ahead of 2023 elections. The lawmakers, who spoke at the 17th Executive/Legislative Parley, said adequate preparations were needed to make the elections successful. Both emphasised the need for collaboration between the two arms of government for seamless governance. The parley has the theme: ‘Mobilising Citizens as a Social Capital Towards 2023 General Elections’. According to Obasa, there should be adequate voter education to avoid apathy, violence and void votes.   ‘Youths targets for subversive influence, others’     ‘Whistleblowers should be protected’     Assembly promises to intervene in communal crisis   He stressed that Nigeria’s preparedness for 2023 meant that democracy had become entrenched in the country. Obasa said: “The fact that Nigeria is planning another election after 23 years of democratic transition is a sign that democratic principles have been widely accepted despite the problems confronting the process. “As the nation shows commitment to its stability, the time is ripe for civil society to prepare and the citizenry to demand power sharing in a participatory democracy.” Yishawu, on his part, said: “For me, and a lot of people, we believe that Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu is the only candidate to beat in 2023. This is somebody that has distinguished himself, his records and pedigree speak for him. “But in politics, you don’t just sit back and say I know who I am. This is a leader that is able to see the unseen and foresee the unknown. So we need that kind of qualities to be able to take us from where we are today and take us to where we ought to be.”
