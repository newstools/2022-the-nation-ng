Officials of Bayelsa State Vigilante Service (BSVS) have arrested a suspected ritualist, one Ebere Nwosu, 49, in Yenagoa, the state capital. The suspect was arrested while allegedly plotting to lure three minors away at the popular Tombia-Etegwe Roundabout. Nwosu was reportedly apprehended after a close observation of his suspicious interaction with the minors who were hawking sachet water, popularly known as pure water. It was gathered that the BSVS operatives, stationed at the roundabout, noticed that at about 5pm on Monday, the suspect was engaging the minors in a suspicious conversation while making several phone calls.   ‘Queen Elizabeth II alive, death reports false’     Buhari swears-in six new INEC Commissioners     JUST IN: Court orders forfeiture of 10 properties, funds…   It was learnt that one of the operatives, after several minutes of observation from a distance, approached the suspect to ask what the problem was and why he held up the minors.
