Many motorists in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) yesterday shunned the council election to queue for fuel at filling stations. As The Nation monitored the sale of petrol around the city alongside the voting exercise, it was observed that different retail outlets, including those of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) opened to customers. On the Kubwa Expressway route, Etena petrol station, Dutse Junction, sold the product just like the NNPC outlet beside Gwarimpa. The mini NNPC in Jahi; A.A. Rano in AYA and Evergreen Oil and Gas, Jikwoyi  also sold the product.
