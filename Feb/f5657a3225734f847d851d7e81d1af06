The Confederation of African Football (CAF) have rejected Ghana’s plan to change the venue for next month’s 2022 World Cup playoffs against the Super Eagles. The Ghana Football Association (GFA) requested CAF they wish to move the match from Cape Coast Stadium to the Baba Yara Stadium in Kumasi. The epic clash is fixed for March 23 with the return leg in Nigeria six days later. However, CAF have replied saying this application fell well outside the time allowed for such and as a result the match is confirmed for the Cape Coast Stadium.
