Quadri Aruna could not save TTC RhönSprudel Fulda-Maberzell from going down 2-3 at home to Saarbrücken in match day 16 of the Table Tennis Bundesliga (TTBL). The defeat against the German Cup champion at the weekend saw TTC RhönSprudel Fulda-Maberzell dropping from the play-off zone to fifth place on the league table. Frenchman Alexandre Cassin gave TTC a smooth 3-0 (11-9, 11-8, 11-8) win against Darko Jagic and steered the game in the right direction. But in the second game Aruna despite spirited efforts lost 2-3 to German international Patrick Franziska. In the epic confrontation, the Nigerian was on the brink of an important win against the German with a match at 2-2 (11-6, 5-11, 11-8, 6-11) as he was leading 10-4 in the fifth set only to lose seven points in a row and lost eventually. Ruwen Filus clearly won his tie against Tomas Polansky 3-0 (12-10, 11-5, 11-3) to hand TTC a 2-1 lead.

However, with Cassin’s defeat, it was clear that the final doubles would be difficult for the TTC since Saarbrücken was clearly favoured .  The TTC duo consisting of Filus and Aruna were uncoordinated against Jorgic and Polansky and subsequently lost 3-0 (7-11, 10-12, 9-11). “It was an amazing game. Fulda deserved it just as much as we did,” Franziska said afterwards. “We’re happy to have won against a playoff contender, but we were definitely the happier team today.” Although Fulda missed the hoped-for return to fourth place due to their seventh defeat of the season, they are still one game behind. The game of the 12th matchday against TTC OE Bad Homburg will be rescheduled for February 18th. The TTC is currently two points behind TTF Liebherr Ochsenhausen.
