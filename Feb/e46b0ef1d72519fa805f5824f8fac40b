Ethica noted that the next generation of Islamic finance professionals is currently in university, and it is critical that standards-based Islamic finance knowledge is imparted on them before the students enter the workforce. “We look forward to Majan University College becoming a beacon of Islamic finance learning in Oman and are delighted to offer them country exclusivity,” Ethica stated. Ethica’s certifications are officially recognised by the Accounting and Auditing Organisation for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI), the world’s leading standard-setting body in Islamic finance.
