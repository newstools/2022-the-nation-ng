Despite not declaring open, employment into the core civil service since 2015, investigations have shown that the Akwa Ibom State Government is secretly recruiting employees. Findings also reveal that workers have been resuming in ministries, departments and agencies without undergoing any formal employment process. Although the government, through the Head of the Civil Service (HoCS), Mr. Effiong Essien, has denied the development, applicants have accused the government of insincerity and double standards. Many of the commissioners and permanent secretaries have feigned ignorance about the recruitment, saying they were not privy to any notice or declaration of vacancies.

One of the applicants, Mrs. Enobong Akpaah, said she paid N250,000 to a top government official to secure a job, but had not gotten the job. “We are many who have paid money to get civil service jobs.

He, however, admitted that those being employed were selected from the data bank of those who had responded to the advertised vacancies.
