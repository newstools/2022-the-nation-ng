Gospel singer Sammie Okposo and his wife appeared to have put the recent adultery scandal behind them after embarking on a vacation to Cacum, Mexico. Okposo made the headline last month after he confessed to an adulterous affair with a US-based woman. The previous month, a Houston-based American citizen simply known as African Doll accused the singer of impregnating her. According to the lady, she met the singer in Dallas, United States of America, during one of his tours. She said she didn’t know the singer was married until after she got pregnant.

He particularly sought his wife’s forgiveness for the disgrace and embarrassment his actions caused. The singer however, deleted his public apology less than 24 hours later. Few weeks after the infidelity scandal, the gospel music star has taken to his Instagram page to share a video from their vacation in the North American country. “Me and my Queen we Aaaaaaaaside chilling in Cancun Mexico”, the “Wellu Wellu” singer captioned the video. Okposo got married to Ozioma in July 2010.
