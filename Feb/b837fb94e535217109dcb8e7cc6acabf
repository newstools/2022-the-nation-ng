Tyson Fury has predicted his former opponent Deontay Wilder would knock out Anthony Joshua in three rounds if the pair fought. Wilder and Joshua have been linked to fighting each other for several years, with Eddie Hearn stating in 2018 that ‘AJ’ would fight the American in a unification bout. Joshua held three world titles at that point whilst Wilder had reigned as WBC champion for several years, defending his belt six times. But a highly-anticipated fight between the two heavy hitters would never materialise and they would both go on to lose their titles. Joshua lost his belts to Oleksandr Usyk in his last fight whilst Wilder dropped his WBC belt in his 2020 rematch with Fury.

Joshua will try and become a three-time heavyweight champion by seeking to avenge his loss against Usyk when he rematches the Ukrainian later this year. Fury has fought Wilder three times, stopping him twice after fighting to a controversial draw in their first meeting four years ago. Wilder pondered retirement after his recent loss to Fury, but has promised he will not give up on his boxing career stating “the best is yet to come”.
