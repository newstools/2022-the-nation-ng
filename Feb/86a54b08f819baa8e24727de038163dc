Debutants north east succumbed to a very experienced south -south zone in the first female game of the third national U-17 Cricket Championship, losing by 223 runs. The tournament organized by the Nigeria Cricket Federation and sponsored by Pricewaterhouse Coopers (PwC) began Wednesday at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium, Abuja. The North East zone until now, had failed to present participants for the event as a result of insecurity challenges in the region. The first group A game proved to be a difficult one for the Northern side, who are facing champions of the female event since the tournament’s inception in 2019. Expectedly, south -south zone got off an amazing start,  even after losing the toss to North East– who opted for field first. - Advertisement - South -south scored 232 runs for the loss of six wickets in 20 overs in the first innings.

The runs for total for south-south looked a very challenging one for the Northern zone to chase as they fell to the fielding prowess of their opponents in the second innings. It was a consistent fall of wickets even from the first ball as the defending champions needed only four overs to dislodge the debutants, leaving them with nine runs, all out in 4.4 overs. After the game, Mercy Ene, team manager of north east, said her players were only in the tournament to learn, adding that it was difficult getting the team to come to Abuja in the first place.     SPONSORED
