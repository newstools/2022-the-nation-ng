The Finance Minister stated that “the government will continue to prioritize spending on critical infrastructure in order to sustain the momentum on GDP growth. As you may be aware, the GDP is projected to grow by 4.20per cent in 2022. This can only be possible through steady increase in spending on critical infrastructure, such as roads”. Speaking at the occasion, Mr Fashola (SAN) said: “Recall in 2016 or thereabout, there was recession. The Economic Management Team is tasked to mobilize capital for infrastructure partly to ease cost of doing business, transportation of goods and people. One of the funding sources adopted was sukuk. As soon as announced, hell was let lose. They claim its adoption was to Islamize Nigeria. The first sukuk, N100 billion was applied equitably to each zone. In the fullness of time, people began to see its usefulness”. Earlier in her opening remarks, the Director-General, DMO, Ms. Patience Oniha said deploying Sukuk proceeds to fund infrastructure projects aligns with one of the strategic objectives of the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, which is the development of infrastructure. “Improvement in infrastructure due to its multiplier effects is widely accepted as one of the best means of creating jobs, supporting and attracting new business and promoting overall growth and development,” DMO chief said.
