A private worker, Mrs Juliet Akaeze, has denied that she and her children were held hostage by her husband, Felix Akaeze, a staff member of FIRS, at their residence in Chevron Drive, Lekki, Lagos. Mrs Akaeze, while describing the online report as a figment of the writer’s imagination, stressed that she was sure that it emanated from the deepest part of the pit of hell with the sole aim to set her family on fire and distort the peace of her household. She said: “This is a very bad experience and an act of wickedness for my entire family, coming to me as a rude shock because nothing of such as reported by the newspaper ever happened to me and my children. “I have been reporting every day on my workplace and attending to necessary assignments and job details on my desk during the five days that I and my kids were reportedly held hostage with a gun by my husband. The irony of the whole saga is that my husband was out of Lagos for over five days before he came back to the house, on Sunday.   25 suspected Yahoo boys arrested in Ibadan     Man kills neighbour over bucket of water      Hanifa: Kano re-arraigns school proprietor   “Since the fake and damaging report came online, several of my family members, friends and colleagues had been calling me to enquire about my state of health and that of my children.” - Advertisement - “I don’t know how a normal, healthy and pure family affair became a public knowledge that was targeted at smearing and damaging my privacy and peaceful living as a wife and mother. My husband is a responsible family man that works tirelessly to provide for his family to make us happy and stay safe and unhunt, all the time,” Mrs. Akaeze stated. Counsel to the family, Babawibe Gbenga frowned at the attitude of the report, saying: “it’s evil, irresponsible and unreasonable act of journalism practice.” Babawibe said his client family’s good image and reputation has been seriously battered and put to ridicule beyond repairs.     SPONSORED
