Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has agreed to hold talks today with a Russian delegation at the Ukraine-Belarus border amid the Russian invasion. “We agreed that the Ukrainian delegation would meet with the Russian delegation without preconditions on the Ukrainian-Belarusian border, near the Pripyat River,” Zelenskyy said in a statement. Russian President Vladimir Putin yesterday accused Ukrainian authorities of wasting “an opportunity” to hold talks after Moscow’s invasion of its pro-Western neighbour. The Kremlin said Putin had briefed Israel’s Prime Minister Naftali Bennett about “the course of a special military operation to protect Donbas”. Bennet for his part proposed that Israel act as a mediator in talks between Russia and Ukraine “in order to halt the hostilities”, the Kremlin said.

The call followed reports that Zelenskyy had asked Israel to play a mediation role following the Russian invasion. Bennett and Zelenskyy spoke on Friday. Earlier, the Kremlin said a Russian delegation had arrived in Belarus for talks, but Zelenskyy rejected the move as “propaganda”, as Belarus had allowed Russia to stage an invasion from its land, calling for a more neutral location. Zelenskyy also announced Ukraine had filed a suit against Russia in the International Court of Justice, with the President saying it “must be held accountable for manipulating the notion of genocide to justify aggression”. He tweeted: “We request an urgent decision ordering Russia to cease military activity now and expect trials to start next week.”
