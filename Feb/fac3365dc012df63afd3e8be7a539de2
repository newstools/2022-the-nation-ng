Retired striker Bruno Giordano is not impressed with certain reports in the Italian media that Napoli captain Lorenzo Insigne had a better outing than Nigerian striker Victor Osimhen during Saturday’s 1-1 draw against Inter Milan. Insigne scored the only Napoli goal in the 7th minute from the penalty spot, but much of the credit goes to Osimhen, who won the spot-kick two minutes earlier. But Edin Dzeko equalised for the reigning champions moments after the halftime break to ensure a share of the spoils. With his goal, his 116th in the blue shirt, Insigne became the third-highest scoring player for Napoli in all competitions, overtaking late Argentine legend Diego Armando Maradona.

Insigne took only the penalty.” Osimhen featured for 84 minutes against Inter, had two shots blocked, had one shot off target, and had another one saved by goalkeeper Samir Handanovic. SPONSORED
