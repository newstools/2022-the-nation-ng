Galala singer Daddy Showkey has been left nostalgic after a visit to his birthplace in Ajegunle, Lagos. The “Galala” crooner decided to take his fans and followers on a tour to the house (a single room) where he was born and raised alongside his siblings. During the visit, Showkey revealed the video of his hit project, ‘Diana,’ which is considered one of his most successful songs released in 1999, was shot in the same compound he was born and raised. “This is where I was born. This is the compound where I grew up. And this is where I shot the video of my song “Dyna” (Diana). This is a jungle. We are in the jungle. No shaking!” he said.”   Wizkid’s announces collaboration with Asa after 7 years     Simi explains absence from Nigerian idol for two weeks     Mr Macaroni: stop asking when I’ll get married   - Advertisement - Speaking further, the Ajegunle dance hall king said he still pays rent for the room even though he doesn’t know the current occupant(s). “I took a visit to the house and the room I use to leave with my mother and my brothers. You can’t believe I was born in this house, in this same room. “I still retain the room. I still pay for the room to date. I don’t even know who is living in the room today. I have a lot of history in that house, oh my God.”
