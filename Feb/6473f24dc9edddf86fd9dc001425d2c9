They picked me at first but they later said I needed better management, and they rejected me. “However, that did not really discourage me. Rather, it encouraged me to do better and push harder. “My mum told me, “You can’t just start this thing and be successful immediately”. She made me understand that one has to fail before one succeeds. “In the early days of my modelling career, I felt a bit intimidated because of my hijab. I was turned down severally because brands did not want to work with a hijab model. On several occasions, I was blatantly told I had to take off my hijab if I wanted to succeed as a model.”
