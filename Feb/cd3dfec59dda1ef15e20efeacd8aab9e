The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) has restored 180Mega Watts (MW)of out the 630MW shutdown in Egbin Power station. It noted that the ongoing load shedding in the Lagos axis is as a result of the fire incident, which occurred in Egbin Power station on Wednesday. TCN’s General Manager, Public Affairs, Mrs. Ndidi Mbah, who made this known in a statement, recalled that the fire necessitated the shutdown of all the power generating units in the power station. She explained that with the shutdown of the units, a total of 630MW was removed from the grid.

This it did by reducing bulk electricity to Lagos, to avoid overloading the 330kV lines within the state, while the third unit at the Shiroro Station was tied. These were necessary to avoid the collapse of the nation’s grid. Meanwhile, Egbin Power Station is working assiduously to ensure a full restoration of its generating units to the grid and until this happens, TCN will continue to do all it can to keep the grid stable. TCN will continue the evacuation of generated power from Egbin Power Station as soon as the station resumes power generation.
