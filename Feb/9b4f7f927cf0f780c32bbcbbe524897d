Osimhen’s early attempt was deflected over the bar, while Matteo Politano’s half-volley after a Giovanni Di Lorenzo knockdown skimmed the woodwork. There was a bizarre incident in the early part of the second half when Ebuehi accidentally ran into the referee, the clash of heads left both in need of patching up for nasty cuts. Napoli took the lead when Politano whipped a ball to the back post where Osimhen peeled away from his marker to steer the header back across the face of goal into the far top corner. In stoppages Ebuehi saw a straight red card following a VAR on-field review for his very high tackle on Dries Mertens.
