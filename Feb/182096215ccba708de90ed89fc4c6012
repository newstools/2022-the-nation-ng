Secretary-General António Guterres, on Wednesday, strongly condemned the arrest of four members of the UN peacekeeping mission in the Central African Republic (CAR), who were arrested in the capital, Bangui. UN Spokesperson, Mr Stéphane Dujarric, in a statement, said the secretary-general called for their release. Local gendarmerie arrested the personnel on Monday while they were escorting a senior military officer from the mission, which is known by the French acronym, MINUSCA. The incident occurred at the airport and those arrested were French peacekeepers, according to international media reports. The UN chief emphasised that MINUSCA personnel “enjoy privileges and immunities which are held in the interest of the United Nations”, he said, in line with the 2014 Status of Forces Agreement between the Organisation and the Government of the CAR.

He also reaffirmed the UN’s solidarity and continued support to the country. (NAN)
