The Federal Government is not ‘sleepwalking into disaster’, the Presidency said yesterday. In a reaction to an article by David Pilling in the Financial Times. Presidential spokesperson Garba Shehu in a statement condemned the writer for describing the Nigerian government as “a government sleepwalking into disaster”. The report claimed that President “Buhari has overseen two terms of economic slump, rising debt and a calamitous increase in kidnapping and banditry. “The one thing you might have thought a former general could control. As said of India, Nigeria grows at night, while the government sleeps which is hardly surprising that some libertarian tech entrepreneurs want the government to withdraw and leave the private sector in charge.” - Advertisement - Shehu criticised the publication for leaving out the security gains by the government, adding that the Boko Haram terrorists have no territory at the moment under the Buhari-led government.

The terror organisation Boko Haram used to administer an area the size of Belgium at the inauguration; now, they control no territory. “The first comprehensive plan to deal with decades-old clashes between nomadic herders and sedentary farmers – experienced across the width of the Sahel – has been introduced: pilot ranches are reducing the competition for water and land that drove past tensions. “Banditry grew out of such clashes. Criminal gangs took advantage of the instability, flush with guns that flooded the region following the Western-triggered implosion of Libya. “The situation is grave. Yet as with other challenges, it’s one that the government would face down.”
