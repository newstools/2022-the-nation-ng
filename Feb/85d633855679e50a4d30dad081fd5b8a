Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has insisted his side’s quest to win the Premier League title remains unaltered following Manchester City’s stunning defeat by Tottenham last weekend. City’s 3-2 loss, with Spurs star and England captain Harry Kane scoring twice, and Liverpool’s earlier win over Norwich, saw Klopp’s men cut the reigning champions’ lead at the top of the table to six points. That deficit will be reduced to three points should Liverpool win their game in hand at home to Leeds today. Klopp, however, remains convinced City will win all their remaining league games, meaning Liverpool must concentrate on themselves.  “I was on the way home when it was 2-1 to Tottenham and didn’t follow it anymore because I was sure they would equalise,” Klopp told a pre-match news conference on Tuesday.

I think you can expect that (Manchester City will win all their games). Historically it happens more often than not.” The German added: “There are so many things that can happen in football. I cannot – I’m just not made for it – count points on our account before we’ve played the game.  “That’s why we have to be 100 percent focused on just this one game because we cannot win the game and the league and everything in one game. We just have to try to make sure we win a very difficult Premier League game.” Leeds have won just one point from their last four games, a run that has seen Marcelo Bielsa’s men slip towards the relegation zone.
