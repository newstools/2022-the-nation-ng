Bolu, who didn’t state how he came about his proposition, made this known recently via his Twitter handle. “Igbo men are the sexiest of all Nigerian men. I said it,” he tweeted. On January 20, 2012, the 28-year-old, revealed his sexual disposition as gay in an Instagram post. - Advertisement - He was clad in rainbow-coloured underwear and also held a similar fabric in the photo he shared.

In an interview that followed afterward, Bolu Okupe revealed he knew he was different at a much younger age. “From the age of 10 or 11, I knew I was different. It starts around pre-puberty years,” he said. His father, while reacting to his son’s disclosure, said his presence in the gay community is for a godly mission. “He is on a sojourn in the LGBT community in order to be an instrument of God to them. By the grace of God, that is what is going to happen. “The day I knew, I wept. I have gone past that, but we are praying for him. I also know, God says my ways and not your ways and he knows the end from the beginning,” he stated.
