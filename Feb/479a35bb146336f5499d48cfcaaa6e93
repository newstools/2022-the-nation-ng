Made Kuti, Afrobeat musician and grandson of Fela Kuti, has said that he is eternally honored to be from the Kuti clan. The young and energetic musician, who in a short period of time is already a Grammy Award nominee, was the recipient of his dad (Femi Kuti) and Granddad’s (Fela Kuti) Afrobeat Hall of Fame Awards in Lagos over the weekend. Receiving the awards on their behalf, Made thanked the organizers for deeming it fit to recognise the legends at the induction ceremony. He also thanked the fans for enjoying to the family’s music.

Speaking on the influence both parents had on his career, he said: “they are the sole initiator of my love for music. Seeing my dad perform four times a week at the shrine, watching him compose music, watching him take it to the studio, I was lucky to be a part of the entire process of some of his projects. When you see all these as a child with so much consistency it puts you in awe and that can either push you in the direction of loving that craft or being afraid of that craft”. Made also joined Wizkid on stage to perform one of Fela’s classic hits, ‘Trouble Sleep Yanga Wake Am’ as he made a tribute to Fela. The Inaugural Afrobeat Hall of Fame induction was held on Saturday, February 26, 2022, at The Amore Gardens, Lekki Phase 1, Lagos, with some iconic musicians and event organizers being honored with plaques respectively.
