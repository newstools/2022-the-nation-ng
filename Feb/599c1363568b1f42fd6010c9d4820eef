Former President Olusegun Obasanjo is fast emerging as a leading strategist ahead the 2023 general elections. For a man who has announced his retirement from politics, Sentry views the rate at which he’s being consulted over strategies with amazement. During the week, convener of the Northern Elders Forum (NEF), Prof. Ango Abdullahi, held a secret meeting with him in Abeokuta. Their discussion, according to an aide to the former president touched on the next elections.   Evacuation of Nigerian students not possible, sky unsafe to…     Attack: FG assures Nigerians of safe evacuation from Ukraine     FG to Russia: Withdraw your troops from Ukraine, stop…   In fact, Abdullahi specifically said he was in Abeokuta to discuss ‘strategies’ with Obasanjo. The meeting lasted two hours. The NEF chief said the country needed good tidings from the 2023 elections, hence the need to plan. He added that in spite of their ages, they could still contribute to society. Sentry recalls that National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Iyochia Ayu, recently led a powerful delegation to Abeokuta to see Obasanjo. Some governors also visited the former president not too long ago. And he has played host to various political groups angling to ‘rescue’ the country come 2023. During one of those meetings, Obasanjo clearly told his guests that he has no plan to get involved in partisan politics ever again, but he was quick to add that he will always offer his services whenever he is called upon by politicians, perhaps in furtherance of his new found role as a ‘political strategist’.
