We remain grateful to them and pray that they succeed in the work they are doing. “We have noticed with great worries the abduction of some of our ad hoc staff with the election materials towards the end of the polls. While the earlier violence started with snatching materials it ended with the abduction of our staff, ballot papers and materials. “Some of our abducted adhoc staff were blindfolded and taken to unknown destinations where they were compelled to thump print the ballot papers. “We wish to reassure the general public that the results manufactured from unknown places will not be collected. The number of votes caste must be tallied with the number of accredited voters,” he stated.
