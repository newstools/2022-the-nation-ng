According to him, people can also apply for the voter card online. “The PVC is your weapon and you will have the right to vote and be voted for. “It will enable you to vote for competent leaders across all positions, irrespective of their political or religious affiliations,” the director said. Onwo called on politicians to desist from political thuggery, hate speech and form of violence before, during and after the 2023 elections. (NAN)
