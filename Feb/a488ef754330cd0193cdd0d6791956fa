Gentleman Dele Taiwo has blamed the pioneers of Juju music for the current disunity amongst Juju artists. Taiwo said that the division among the frontline musicians in the genre is not new as it has been there from the onset. He argued that leaders in the genre do not give opportunities to upcoming artists to grow in the genre, hence, seeing to the dearth of the genre in Nigeria. The UK-based music star made this known in a chat at the burial ceremony of late Dayo ‘wonder boy’ Kujore in Igbore Robiyan community, Abeokuta, Ogun state on Friday, January 28, 2022.

They hardly encourage the upcoming ones. When I started, I was the youngest Juju musician and through me, a lot of young ones said “since I can do it, they can also do it.” - Advertisement - Continuing, Taiwo, who was the only notable musician that graced the late Kujore’s burial said, “It’s just that it is common mostly in Africa and maybe in Nigeria. the rivalry is there but in as much we can remove that and unite ourselves and be one, let’s sing a unity song, the sky is just our limit.” Taiwo was quick to note that several Juju stars emerged from the church. “Most of them that were church choirs started diverting into Juju and today you could see a lot of young Juju musicians.” The Juju music star disclosed that he is currently working on the release of his first official single in 2022. “If you noticed, I’ve been off and on because I’m based abroad. People don’t have time and patience to listen to a whole album anymore, they just want something that is very small and meaningful so I have chorused along that line. My singles will be out before Easter.”
