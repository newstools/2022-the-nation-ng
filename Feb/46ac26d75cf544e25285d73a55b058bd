American socialite Kim Kardashian has reportedly unfollowed her estranged rapper husband Kanye West on Instagram. Kardashian unfollowed Ye on the photo and video-sharing social networking app on Thursday amid all of his tirades about her, their family and her current beau, Pete Davidson. Ye has reportedly been sharing negative messages about Davidson online after it was revealed that he is dating his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian. The unfollowing happened shortly after the rap star recently posted attacks about the “Saturday Night Live” star to his account with the caption: “HI SKETE YOU GOT ANYMORE MENTAL HEALTH JOKES FOR ME?”   DJ Cuppy celebrates puppies at one, says ‘I’m a great…     Wife stabs senior rival to death in Ondo     Burna Boy’s elated grandma praises singer over bag gift   - Advertisement - In a second post, 44-year-old West said he wasn’t harassing Davidson but just getting “payback.” The mother-of-four previously urged her ex-hubby to cease with the cyber bullying over concerns for her new lover’s safety. She said the Yeezy boss ‘would be blamed’ if anything happened to her new man. “U are creating a dangerous and scary environment and someone will hurt Pete and this will all be your fault,” the 41-year-old businesswoman wrote. The 44-year-old then posted on Instagram asking people not to “do anything physical” to Davidson, explaining that he would like to “handle the situation” himself. SPONSORED
