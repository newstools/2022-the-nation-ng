FORMER Super Eagles prolific winger Ndubuisi Okosieme, has appealed to the leadership of the Nigeria Football Federation NFF Amaju Pinnick, not to axe any member of the Super Eagles technical crew that took part in the Nations Cup. The Benin-City based former Eagles star advised the NFF to bring on board the erstwhile Barcelona star Emmanuel Amuneke to work with coach Austin Eguavoen in the technical crew.

Coach Austin Eguavoen is very sound he has been there before and he is there again. Our ouster from the Nations Cup should not been seen as failure. So there is no need crucifying the players or the technical crew. I know that Eagles have learnt their lessons.” “You will  also agree with me that Emmanuel Amuneke, has consistently featured in the technical study of groups for both CAF and FIFA if appointed into the system, he will bring his expertise and experience to bear which I think will  enhance better results for us in subsequent competitions.”
