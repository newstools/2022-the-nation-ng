Manchester United reportedly view Spain boss Luis Enrique as a potential candidate to become the club’s new head coach ahead of the 2022-23 campaign. Ralf Rangnick is currently in charge of the Red Devils on an interim basis, but he will step aside this summer to take on a consultancy role at Old Trafford. Mauricio Pochettino is believed to be the favourite for the role, with a recent report claiming that the majority of the Man United players wanted the Paris Saint-Germain manager to be appointed. However, according to ESPN, Enrique is being considered as a candidate, with Man United chiefs believing that he has the necessary credentials and ‘winning track record’ to bring success to the club.
