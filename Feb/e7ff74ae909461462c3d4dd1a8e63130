The World Bank Group has said non-performing loans and hidden debts are making it difficult for banks to grant new credits to customers. In a report released yesterday, the bank disclosed that developing countries face growing risks from financial fragility created by the COVID-19 crisis and non-transparent debt.

World Bank Group President David Malpass, explained that as rising inflation and interest rate increases pose further challenges to recovery, developing countries need to focus on creating healthier financial sectors.
