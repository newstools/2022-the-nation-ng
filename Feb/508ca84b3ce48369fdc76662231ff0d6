Interest groups in the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) have expressed support for Niger East Senator Muhammad Sani Musa to become the party’s next national chairman. APC is expected to elect its officials of its National Executive Committee (NEC) at its national convention later this month. The stakeholders said Musa would lead the party to a landslide victory in the 2023 general election. Coordinator of the party’s joint stakeholders, Umar Waziri Kumo, spoke at the weekend in Daura, Katsina State, during the installation ceremony of Transportation Minister Rotimi Ameachi as Dan Amanan Daura. Kumo said talks and mobilisation of delegates and influential party bigwigs were ongoing to rally support for Musa to become the APC national chairman.

He said the party was trying to avoid repeating its past mistakes, particularly those of taking sensibilities of Nigerians for granted. “To avoid repeating such costly mistakes that may rob us the chance to maintain our supremacy at the centre, there is need to have a national chairman that is not known for any controversy and scandal. “We must have a national chairman who commands respect from all regions of Nigeria and can take instant decisions on urgent issues affecting the affairs of the party. “It is our conviction that one individual, among other contenders who could do this for our great party, is no other person than Senator 313.”
