Rapper Jude Abaga popularly known as M.I has attempted to provide explanations on why some youths resort to internet fraud, ritual killings, and other vices in a bid to survive. The rap star speaking with IT expert, Olaniyi Ayoola in Abeokuta refuted the claim that youths are lazy. He argued it is erroneous to hold on to such a claim seeing the gross unemployment rate in the country. Abaga said: “The youths of Nigeria have been looking for jobs. For anyone to make a claim that they are lazy, the person must be able to look at the indices. “You can’t just make that sort of conjecture without having the economic framework within which that’s true.

The unemployment rate tells you that there are no jobs. “If you look at the job market, you will see that there has been serious gross unemployment for a long time. He added: “Anytime that there’s gross unemployment, there’s also a tendency for there to be high crime rate, which is what we are experiencing. “But the high crime rate is not the indication of young people’s attitudes. It’s an indication that there is an ecosystem where there is no opportunity for them to work. “And, because they can’t work, and they have to eat, that’s why they have to find a means to survive. That is what we are experiencing in Nigeria today.” SPONSORED
