They were charged for illegal receiving funds from former Minister of Petroleum Diezani Alison-Madueke to finance the re-election campaign of former President Goodluck Jonathan. EFCC prosecution counsel, Yusuf Muchaka, said the accused breached the law by receiving money they knew was corruptly sourced. He supported the charge with an affidavit sworn to by Olayinka Rotimi, an operative with EFCC who was part of the team that investigated the case. However, defense counsel, Barr. Sunday Oyawole argued that the witness was not the maker of the tendered documents and therefore urged the court to discard them.
