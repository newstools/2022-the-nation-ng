MANY communities and people  are able to connect through  social media. The world is a global village as  people  can communicate and maintain good relationship with family and friends. Mostly importantly, the impact of social media cannot be overemphasised. Some people can attribute their success to it.  While some got scholarships, awards, some got engaged and married to their partners via social media. However, it is  unfortunate that this same social media which has impacted positively on  people,  has also destroyed lives,taking into cognisance, frightening occurrences  in Ogun, Lagos and some other places in the country. This is so disheartening seeing how some teenagers beheaded a young lady in Abeokuta all for the sake of looking for quick money  and fortune.
