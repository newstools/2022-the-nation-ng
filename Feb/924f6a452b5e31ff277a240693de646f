A Bauchi High court on Tuesday adjourned a suit against the former Chief of Air Staff (CAS), retired Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar to Feb. 22 for hearing. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the suit with file number BA/81m/22 was filed by Mr Danlami Takko and 25 others. Counsel for the plaintiffs, Mr Usman Darazo prayed the court to compel the respondent to within 30 days make public his intention to run or not run for the position of governor of Bauchi State in the 2023 general elections. Darazo argued that his clients were agitating for good governance in the state and had identified the respondent as one of the indigenes best suited to occupy the office of the governor because of his numerous achievements while in office.
