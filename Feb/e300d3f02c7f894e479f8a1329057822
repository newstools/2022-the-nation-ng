A civil society organisation (CSO), Advocacy for Advancement of Peace and Harmony in Africa Initiative (ADAPHAI), yesterday urged other states across the country and political parties to make the primary election of the Osun State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) their model. The group, which also said the Saturday primary election was peaceful, credible and orderly, added: “It was strictly in line with electoral guidelines and democratic ethos.” Addressing reporters yesterday in Osogbo, the state capital, ADAPHAI’s National Coordinator Sulaimon Suberu said: “The pattern of conduct of the process was credible and in line with the democratic ethos and electoral guidelines with the display of party register in all the 332 wards and proper accreditation of party members.   2023: Ogoni monarchs pledge support for Abe, Tinubu     Lasun declines comment     How Oyetola trounced Aregbesola’s man Adeoti   “The turnout of members of the party was massive and participation was active and encouraging. Largely, every member was given the opportunity to exercise their franchise without any form of intimidation. “All in all, the process of the APC primary election in Osun State was free, fair and democratic. It is indeed a model for other states and other political parties. - Advertisement - “In all, the report of violence is less than one per cent in all the 332 wards in the state.
