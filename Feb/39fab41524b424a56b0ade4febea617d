West Ham face a daunting Europa League last-16 tie as they take on record six-time winners Sevilla. The Andalusian club, who won the competition three times in a row between 2014 and 2016, are one of only two sides along with Real Madrid to have retained their title. The Hammers have reached the last 16 of the Europa League for the first time while Sevilla have won the tournament on four of their last five appearances. West Ham were one of the seeded teams in Friday’s draw having been among the sides who finished top of their Europa League groups, meaning they will play the second leg of their last-16 tie at home. It means they will head to the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan Stadium for the first leg on March 10 to take on Julen Lopetegui’s side, where the final will take place this year in May. Meanwhile, Rangers will play Serbian champions Red Star Belgrade in the Europa League last 16, with the first leg taking place at Ibrox.
