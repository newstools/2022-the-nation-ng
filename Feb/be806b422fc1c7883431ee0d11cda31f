The Kwara State Command of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) said it has arrested one 41 years old AbdulKadir Bolaji and two other suspects for alleged burglary incidents in Lakele community, Oro in Irepodun Local Government Area of the state. Abdulkadir, the command said, had been parading himself as a soldier before his arrest. The other suspects are Olalekan Adeniyi (32) and Dare Ajiboye (31).
