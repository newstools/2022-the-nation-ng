Former Chairman, Agro and Allied Group, Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry,  Mogaji  noted that insecurity and supply chain challenges were going to affect measures  put in place  to control rising food prices . According to him, there were issues disrupting the food supply chains, adding that it has also hampered the production processing. Prices are being pushed up by a host of factors, ranging from supply chain bottlenecks, increasing insecurity and labour shortage, increases in oil prices and energy costs, input costs – feed and fertiliser – and labour and transport. He noted that there was little room for optimism about a return to a more stable market conditions given high input costs, ongoing pandemic as well as uncertainties lingering the climate conditions. Since higher food inflation has had a negative effect on the nation, Mogaji said it is crucial for policy makers to design appropriate policies to curb inflation. According to him, the strategy to control the country’s inflation must be implemented on a long-term basis, especially for food items. In December 2020, the  Nigeria Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said there was an increase in food prices in the month of December.It stated this in a report titled, ‘Selected food price watch’, noting that there was a rice in the prices of selected food items in December.

According to farmers, the cost of producing crops is on the rise, with every aspect, from labour, transport and fertiliser costs, up by more than 30 per cent. In 2019, Consumer prices rose 0.94 per cent on a month-on-month basis in April, up from March’s 0.79 per cent climb. The acceleration was largely driven by faster growth of food prices. In 2020, inflation rose to 12.8per cent from 11.4per cent in 2019, fueled by higher food prices due to constraints on domestic supplies and the pass-through effects of an exchange rate premium that widened to about 24per cent. The removal of fuel subsidies and an increase in electricity tariffs added further to inflationary pressures. Border closure had   high economic consequences on food prices. The closure continues to have high economic consequences on food prices in food prices. The Nigerian Bureau of Statistics (NBS) stated this in its consumer price index (CPI) report noted “The composite food index rose by 14.85per cent in January 2020 compared to 14.67per cent in December 2019.” The rise in the food index was caused by increases in prices of bread and cereals, meat, oils and fats, potatoes, yam, other tubers, and fish. On a month-on-month basis, the food sub-index increased by 0.99 in January 2020, up by 0.02per cent points from 0.97per cent recorded in December 2019. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said rising food prices is the major factor fueling inflation in Nigeria and other sub-Saharan African countries. According to the body, inflation is rising around the world, but because food accounts for about 40 per cent of the SSA’s consumption basket, it plays a major determining role in inflation.
