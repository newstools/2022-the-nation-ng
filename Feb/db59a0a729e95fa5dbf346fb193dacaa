The Federal Government has been urged to initiate measures to address the plight of the original inhabitants of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), who are referred to as Abuja indigenes.  While making this call, a group, the Socio-Economic Research and Development Centre (SERDEC) argued that it was wise for the government to promptly address the complaints of economic, political and social deprivations being raised by Abuja natives.  SERDEC’s Executive Director, Tijani Abdulkareem said addressing the economic injustice, marginalisation and deprivation being suffered by the original inhabitants of the FCT would forestall a possible replication, in Abuja, of the violent agitations being experienced in the Niger Delta and other parts of the country.  Abdulkareem spoke in Abuja yesterday while unveiling a project on “promoting the rights of the original inhabitants (OIs) in the FCT,” being executed by his organisation, in collaboration with Resource Centre for Human Rights Education (CHRICED).
