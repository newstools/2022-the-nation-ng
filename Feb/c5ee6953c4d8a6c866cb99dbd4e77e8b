The operators paid additional N2 billion between October 2021 and January. The association had put the number of insured businesses that were affected as a result of the protest at about 2,000. Protesters under the banner of #EndSARS had trooped out in Nigeria’s major towns and cities in October 2020, demanding an end to police brutality and a comprehensive reform of the police in the country. The two-week protest, which was initially peaceful, suddenly turned violent after it was hijacked by hoodlums.
