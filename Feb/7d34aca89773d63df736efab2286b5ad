Sadly this woman was murdered by her own son; that is the effect of drugs,” he said. One of the suspects, Adamu Lawal, 53, was paraded for the alleged rape of his neighbour’s 10-year- old daughter, who usually took animal feed to him. “This suspect took advantage of that and forcefully had carnal knowledge of the little girl,” Babaita said, adding that investigation was still on.
