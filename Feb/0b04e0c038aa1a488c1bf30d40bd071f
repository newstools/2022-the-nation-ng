MTN Nigeria Communications (MTN Nigeria) Plc has the potential to grow its earnings by double digits and has more than a quarter headroom for share price appreciation given the overall outlook of the telecommunications sector and MTN Nigeria’s leading position. In their latest stock analysis, analysts at Cordros Capital said they believe MTN Nigeria is well-positioned to benefit from the structural upsides in Nigeria’s fast-growing telecommunication sector given its market leadership position, growing 4G coverage, and rising footprints in the rural areas through its mobile money (MOMO) agents. The review came on the heels of the release of the audited report and accounts of MTN Nigeria for the 2021 business year. Key extracts of the audited report and accounts for the year ended December 31, 2021 showed that gross revenue increased by 23.3 per cent to N1.7 trillion. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) grew by 27.9 per cent to N877.1 billion with EBITDA margin increasing by 2.1 percentage points to 53.0 per cent. Profit after tax rose by 45.5 per cent to N298.7 billion, implying earnings per share of N14.67. The underlying business fundamentals showed that while mobile subscribers decreased by eight million to 68.5 million, active data users increased by 1.7 million to 34.3 million. Also, active fintech subscribers rose by 4.8 million to 9.4 million. Analysts said they expected 2022 earnings to be “propelled by the growth in voice, data and fintech revenue, as well as improved operational efficiency”. - Advertisement - Analysts noted that based on the latest earnings report and the outlook, MTN Nigeria’s net profit may rise by 34.5 per cent to some N401.58 billion in 2022, translating to earnings per share estimate of N19.73 per share compared with N14.67 recorded in 2021. According to analysts, on the basis of the 2022 earnings estimate, dividend per share may rise by 34.5 per cent to N17.64 for the 2022 business year as against N13.12 earmarked for the 2021 business year. The estimated dividend for 2022 implies a dividend yield of 10.4 per cent on the company’s recent public offer price of N169 per share and nearly nine per cent on its current market share price. Cordros Capital increased its target share price for MTN Nigeria to N248.18 from its previous estimate of N226.48, implying a potential upside of 25.3 per cent based on the price of N198 per share recorded as at the opening of the stock market this week.   ‘Saving culture important to surviving harsh economy’     SEC, CIS make case for professionalism     FMDQ Exchange lists N154b commercial papers, mutual funds   Analysts said based on the 2022 estimates, MTN Nigeria trades at price earnings ratio of 10.0 times and EV/EBITDA of 4.8 times compared to emerging market peers average of 20.7 times and 6.6 times. “Consequently, we upgrade our rating to a ‘BUY’ from ‘HOLD’,” Cordros Capital stated. Analysts noted that MTN Nigeria added approximately one million subscribers following the alignment of its SIM registration and activation centres with regulatory guidelines and this trend is expected to continue with improvement in subscribers’ acquisition and forecast growth of 4.4 per cent to 71.49 million customers in 2022. According to analysts, data revenue will remain a key driver of service revenue in 2022 as the company sustained the robust expansion in data revenue, which grew by 55.3 per cent to N516.21 billion in 2021. “It is pertinent to note that MTN Nigeria acquired and activated an additional 800MHz spectrum in first quarter 2021. Furthermore, the company was awarded the bid-at an auction held in December 2021 to acquire a 100MHz spectrum licence in the 3.5GHz band to roll out 5G services. Management expressed optimism that 5G will provide the foundation upon which future network performance will be built. “We believe this will give the company a competitive advantage over its peers, given that it is the only mobile network operator (MNO) to be awarded a 5G license. In addition, we believe the country favourable demographics underpinned by the large population-estimated at 200 million with a median age of 19, rising adoption of social media platforms for communication and digital marketing, and increasing internet penetration are key drivers of data revenue. Accordingly, we estimate data revenue will grow by 26.5 per cent in 2022. Further out, we project data revenue will grow by an average of 25.7 per cent over 2022 to 2026, while the data revenue share will rise to 43.2 per cent in 2026 from 33.6 per cent in 2022,” Cordros Capital stated. Analysts noted that while network operating costs will remain elevated in the year given the pass-through impact of the naira devaluation on BTS lease cost, the continued rollout of 4G sites to improve 4G coverage, and maintenance-related expenses, revenue growth and operational efficiencies will limit the overall impact on margins and EBITDA margin will rise to 53.6 per cent in 2022 and average 54.8 per cent between 2023 and 2026, hitting a peak of 55.4 per cent in 2026.
