Ademola Lookman has praised Leicester City for the performance they delivered despite losing 2-1 to Wolverhampton Wanderers on Sunday. The Foxes were dominant in large spells at Molineux Stadium, however after Lookman had cancelled out Rúben Neves’ opener, Daniel Podence converted in the second half to win it for the hosts. The result did not reflect City’s display, though, and Lookman explained his side can be encouraged by several aspects, even though they were unable to claim anything from the match. Lookman told LCFC TV: “[It’s] very disappointing. I think we dominated throughout the game today, in the first and the second half. It’s disappointing, but it’s about us going forward and putting this game behind us. It’s not the result that we want, but we’ll keep on working.

It’s just a shame that we couldn’t get the three points today. I thought we deserved them, but yes, we’ll keep on working.” - Advertisement - Although it will no doubt be difficult to accept the outcome, Lookman said the Foxes will remain positive as they look to qualify for the last-16 of the UEFA Europa Conference League on Thursday. Leicester heads to Danish side Randers in a bid to build on the comprehensive 4-1 victory in the first leg – a game in which Lookman notched two assists. Lookman added at full-time: “He (Brendan Rodgers) just told us to keep our heads up, don’t let our heads drop. Our performance today was a lot more like us, and we’ll keep on working.  “In football, the games come quickly, so today, we were unfortunate today, but we have our next fixture coming up and we’ll look to put it right.” SPONSORED
