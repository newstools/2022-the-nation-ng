FORMER Super Eagles star Odion Ighalo has heaped praises on Watford striker and compatriot Emmanuel Dennis for his spectacular performances for the Hornets this season. Dennis made the switch from Club Brugge to Vicarage Road last summer, and so far, he has been nothing short of spectacular. He has wasted no time stamping his authority as the primary outlet in the team- the 24-year-old has been involved in 14 of Watford’s 24 goals this season. Dennis needs one more goal to become the fourth Watford player to score 10+ goals in a single Premier League season.

Get a couple of goals home and away; then I think the team can escape relegation.” He added. Watford currently sit 19th, four points away from safety. However, with the outstanding displays that Dennis has churned out this season, it would be a surprise to see him go down with them.
