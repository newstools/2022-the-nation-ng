Super Eagles defender Tyronne Ebuehi is facing the possibility of a lengthy spell on the sidelines after suffering an injury in Venezia’s 1-1 draw against Genoa last weekend. Making a return to the squad following his dismissal against Victor Osimhen’s Napoli in the first week of February, Ebuehi replaced Domen Črnigoj at halftime at the Stadio Pierluigi Penzo in Venezia. But the 26-year-old only lasted thirty minutes before he was subbed off as well after picking up a knock in his left leg. The results of the tests conducted on Ebuehi have revealed that the Super Eagles defender has a lesion in the semitendinosus muscle of the left leg.

That development could see Ebuehi miss Nigeria’s crucial two-legged FIFA World Cup qualifier against Ghana’s Black Stars on March 25th and 29th . The on-loan Benfica defender was a member of the Super Eagles squad to the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, appearing once in the 2-0 defeat of Guinea-Bissau. Ebuehi’s absence is a blow for Augustine Eguavoen. However, the interim Technical Adviser can still count on the qualities of Torino’s Ola Aina, Orlando Pirates Olisa Ndah, and Cyprus -based Shehu Abdullahi as alternatives at right full-back.
