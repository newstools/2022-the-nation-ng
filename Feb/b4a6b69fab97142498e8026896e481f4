Newcastle United moved four points clear of the Premier League relegation zone with a third straight win as Kieran Trippier’s free-kick sank Aston Villa at St James’ Park. Trippier found a gap through the wall – his attempt hit Emiliano Buendia on its way into the net – after Joe Willock had been fouled by Calum Chambers. Referee Craig Pawson pointed to the penalty spot but it was downgraded to a free-kick after a video assistant referee (VAR) review. However, Newcastle were soon celebrating after Trippier – captaining the side in the absence of unwell Jamaal Lascelles – scored from a set-piece for the second time in as many games.
