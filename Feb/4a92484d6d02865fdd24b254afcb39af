Popular OAP Toke Makinwa has questioned why people record themselves while crying. In a clip shared on her Instagram page, such an act is manipulative and absolutely senseless. “I am sick and tired of people who record themselves crying online. Do you have a mental illness? Are they sick in your family? Is there something wrong with you? Because I don’t get it. Who stole your cookies? It doesn’t make any sense”, Makinwa said “We all cry and I know some people are going to be like, that’s the real part they’re showing you. No, it’s not because, you had to press play, you had to press record before you burst out crying.   ‘King of Boys’ creator Kemi Adetiba announces…     Kanye West begs God to reunite family     Miss Nigeria 2021: I was told to take off hijab to be a…   - Advertisement - “So, it’s almost manipulative. Do not think the people you’re coming online to cry to actually give a fvck. They don’t! you’re only giving them ammunitions.” In her caption, the 37-year-old lifestyle entrepreneur appealed to the person guilty of the act to desist from it. She wrote: “Pls let’s leave this behaviour in the past. Why will you on your camera, go live, press record and start crying. “Not trying to be mean but it is a cry for attention. Do you not have real friends? If you are crying why do you record it?”
