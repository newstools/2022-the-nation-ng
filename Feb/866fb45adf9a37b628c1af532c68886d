Operatives of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) have seized 40,250kg of codeine worth over N2 billion imported in two 40ft containers from India, according to a statement by agency’s spokesman, Femi Babafemi, yesterday. The drug bust comes on the heels of a similar seizure of 14,080kg codeine syrup in a 40ft container imported from India, on Wednesday last week. Babafemi said both seizures followed intelligence from foreign partners and cooperation of other port stakeholders such as Customs, Department of State Services (DSS), the Nigerian Navy and others.
