Nigeria is set to host the 2022 African Junior and Cadet Fencing Championship slated for February 23 – 27 in Lagos with continental powerhouses Egypt and South Africa leading the roll call of participating nations. Nigeria Fencing Federation President, Adeyinka Samuel, disclosed that Nigeria got the hosting rights at the expense of six other countries who also bid to host the championship slated to hold at the Molade Okoya-Thomas Indoor Sports Hall of the Teslim Balogun Stadium. Other countries billed to feature in the tournament are Ghana, Togo, Senegal, Tunisia, Algeria, Angola, Mali and DR Congo among others. Samuel noted that the countries near-flawless hosting of the same tournament in 2018 helped in securing the hosting right at the expense of other nations that bid. “Nigeria bid alongside six other countries but what stands us out is the lasting impression we made in 2018 which was the first-time ever that we hosted an African championship, which the continental body rated as highly successful,” he said.
