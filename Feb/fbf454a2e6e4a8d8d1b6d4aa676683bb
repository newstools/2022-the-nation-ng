About 300 persons, including rehabilitated drug addicts, women and youths, have been empowered by National Agriculture Land Development Authority (NALDA) in Kano State. NALDA, in collaboration with National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) and Salamah Youth Empowerment and Enlightenment Initiative, gave out 300 goats to 100 women, 100 cows for 200 youths at Central Abattoir, Kofarmazugal, Kano. NALDA’s Executive Secretary and Chief Executive Officer Prince Paul Ikonne said the first phase, which targets 500 beneficiaries, and comprising 400 men and 100 women, would be completed next month. He added the remaining 200 would be empowered in coming weeks. According to him, they would be trained in animal husbandry and financial capacity to enhance their ability to manage the business.   ‘Youths targets for subversive influence, others’     ‘Whistleblowers should be protected’     Assembly promises to intervene in communal crisis   He said: “We have empowered the first 300 in this first phase, the remaining 200 will be done by March. This will be done in different states, and we want to encourage other organisations to reach out to these drug addicts to rehabilitate them. NALDA will engage them in meaningful means of income through the agricultural value chains”. Ikonne added that the beneficiaries were registered with the organisation for easy monitoring. Initiator of Salamah Youth Empowerment and Enlightenment Initiative Senator Naja’atu Muhammed (Kano Central), who hailed NALDA’s intervention, described it as the best any parastatal had done in Kano. NDLEA’s State Commandant Isah Mahammed said idleness was a major cause of drug abuse. “With this, they would now face their business while turning away from drugs, that is why NDLEA is happy to associate with the authority  to ensure that drug abuse is alleviated from among the youth”, he noted.
