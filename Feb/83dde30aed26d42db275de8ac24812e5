Former Barcelona striker Kun Aguero has spoken on the heart condition that forced him to early retirement on December 15. Discussing his current quality of life after being forced to walk away from a profession that he loved and had reached the very top of, Aguero has said on Twitch: “If I try to play football-tennis now, I run out of breath when I want to sprint. I just feel like my heart doesn’t work properly.” The 33-year-old’s last competitive outing came in a meeting with Alaves on October 30, 2021. He was replaced in the 42nd minute of that contest after it became apparent that he was in no condition to continue. Just five appearances had been taken in for Barcelona following a high-profile switch, but Aguero was left with no choice but to call time on a short stint in Catalunya.

Aguero has also spoken of how he initially thought a health scare could be shaken off, but he soon realised how severe the situation was. He has said: “The first 15 days I had a terrible time. “When it happened, I thought it was nothing and that I was going to be fine, but when I arrived in the hospital and they left me in a small room alone with a lot of monitors around me, I realised something was bad. “And after two days hospitalised, I started to become nervous.” Goal SPONSORED
