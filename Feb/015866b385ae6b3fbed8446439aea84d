An Abuja-based human rights lawyer Pelumi Olajengbesi has hinted Yoruba Nation activist Sunday Adeyemo aka Sunday Igboho, will soon be released from detention. Although Olajengbesi has since resigned from the team of Nigerian lawyers for Igboho, he advised Yoruba leaders not to be selfish. Igboho has been in detention in Benin Republic since he was arrested at an airport in Cotonou by the West Africa’s nation Security Forces while he was trying to flee to Germany in July 2020. The 49-year-old agitator fled Nigeria for Benin Republic after the Federal Government declared him wanted. Despite frantic efforts to get him released, checks by The Nation show he has spent over 201 days in Benin Republic prison. - Advertisement -   Army plotting execution of detained Obigbo youths, IPOB…     TCN restores 180mw in Egbin power station     I yielded to pressure from friends to form robbery gang…   A Beninise court blocked the extradition of Igboho to Nigeria while ruling that the activist be remanded in prison pending further hearing. His supporters have expressed worries over prolonged stay in detention. Many groups, including Agbekoya Farmers Society and the Diaspora Groups have staged protests to demand the ‘unconditional’ release of Igboho. But reacting on Saturday, Olajengbesi in a terse post on Facebook said: “Chief Sunday Igboho will be out very soon and there will be massive jubilation across the entire Yoruba land. “He is no doubt a courageous MAN. “This is very authoritative just that our Yoruba leaders should stop being selfish and allow good to prevail.”
