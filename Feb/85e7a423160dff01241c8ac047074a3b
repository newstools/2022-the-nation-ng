Super Eagles midfielder Joe Aribo has entered the final year-and-a-half of his £14,000-per-week contract, leading to major question marks over where his long-term future lies. But according to The Scottish Sun, Rangers are set to open talks over Aribo potentially extending his stay at Ibrox. The report suggested boss Giovanni van Bronckhorst believed the 25-year-old as a ‘very important member of his squad and the Dutchman has called for the hierarchy to ensure long-term plans are put in place. Meanwhile, Aribo has challenged his teammates to be more ruthless in the title race after dropping points at Tannadice. It was a bad day at the office for Rangers in the city of discovery as they managed just three shots on target from 29 efforts. - Advertisement - It was one-way traffic for the majority of the game but Ross Graham’s header in the first half had given Dundee United the lead before Aribo equalised in the second period.

We’ve had a lot of chances and played very well, but the result has just not shown that. It is very upsetting. “We had to take more shots, we needed to get the ball in and around the area and make it harder for their defenders  “That is what we had to do in the second half and we did.  “We just couldn’t get lucky enough to get the second goal that we were pushing for.  “There were a lot of good moments in the game today, but we need to be a bit more ruthless in front of goal, and take our chances that come along.” Rangers are now three points behind Celtic in the Premiership title race but are arguably lucky it isn’t four points.
