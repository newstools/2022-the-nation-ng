Nigeria’s queen of track and field Blessing Okagbare has broken silence on her 10- year ban by the Athletics Integrity Unit for doping violations. The Nation reports Okagbare was banned ‘five years for the presence and use of multiple prohibited substances and five years for her refusal to cooperate with the AIU’s investigation into her case.’ The AIU, an independent body under the World Athletics, issued a statement on Friday, banning the athlete for use of prohibited substances and refusal to cooperate with the Unit’s investigation.
