The Arewa Youth Consultative Forum (AYCF) has tackled the Governor of Ondo State, Rotimi Akerelodu (SAN), over what it described as harassment of Northerners in the state by Amotekun operatives. In a terse statement released by AYCF’s National President, Alhaji Yerima Shettima, the Northern youths took a swipe at the Ondo State government for allegedly looking the other way while Northerners get purportedly arrested by people they described as militia disguised as Amotekun on trumped-up charges.
