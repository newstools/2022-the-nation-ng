Super Eagles star Taiwo Awoniyi came off the bench to net his first Bundesliga goal of 2022 and helped Union Berlin secure a three-match losing streak with a 3-1 home win over Mainz on Saturday. Awoniyi had been stuck on nine Bundesliga goals for several weeks, with the former Liverpool signing not hitting the net for Urs Fischer’s men since scoring in the 2-1 defeat of RB Leipzig on December 3rd, a run of 444 minutes.

And Becker repaid his manager’s trust by doubling the home side’s advantage ten minutes into the second period after Genki Haraguchi had given them a seventh-minute lead. Awoniyi entered the fray in the 67th minute after Dominik Kohr had been sent off for the visitors. And the Nigerian international made his presence felt with a composed finish eight minutes later, following more good work from Becker.
