Akwa Ibom Governor Udom Emmanuel has sacked his Chief of Staff Akparawa Ephraim Inyang-eyen with immediate effect. This was contained in a statement by Secretary to the State Government, Dr Emmanuel Ekuwem, in Uyo on Tuesday. The development is coming two days after stakeholders from Onna local government area called for the sack of the Governor’s CoS.
