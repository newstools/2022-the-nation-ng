Airports in Nigeria recorded a dip of 3.38 million passengers in the last three years, data from regulatory authorities reveal. According to data obtained by The Nation from the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), figures for passengers processed for travelling at the nation’s airports for 2021 stands at 14.2 million compared with the 10,447,321 for last year. But in 2019, over 17,580,023 passengers according to the NCAA data processed flights through airports in Nigeria. Investigations have shown that the significant dip in passenger load factor in the period under review  could be attributed to the effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic and its debilitating effects on air travel at domestic, regional and intercontinental levels. The significant dip in 2019 and 2020 figures translates to a difference of  7,147,303 , which experts say could be attributed to the effects of travel bans, lockdowns and other measures taken by the government to checkmate the spread of the raging COVID – 19 Pandemic. - Advertisement - Despite the  devastating effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the Nigerian economy, air travel seems to be experiencing a rebound with  more than 14.2 million persons travelling by air  in 2021.
