No fewer than five persons including an unnamed suspected drug baron were killed yesterday in a renewed cult war in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State capital, between notorious members of the Bobos and Iceland cult groups. It was learnt that scores of persons were severely injured during the clash which led to the lockdown of some streets in the Yenagoa metropolis. The Nation gathered that the killings, which started in the early hours yesterday at OMPADEC area of the state capital, spread to neighbouring areas such as Amarata and Ekeki. The development was said to have left residents of the areas in disarray with many of them abandoning their areas for safety. A source said that the killing of the suspected hard drug peddler at OMPADEC area at about 3am by suspected Bobos cult members might have angered the Iceland boys who control the Amarata area.
