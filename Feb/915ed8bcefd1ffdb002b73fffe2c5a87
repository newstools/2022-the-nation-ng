Lagos socialite Mike Nwogu aka Pretty Mike is back on the lips of many after storming an event with women dressed as animals. This time, the controversial media personality took his artistry to a whole new level when he attended an event in Lagos on Saturday with three animal-dressed ladies. In a video shared on his Instagram page, the three women who accompanied Pretty Mike were seen wearing ‘goat’ masks. The socialite explained it was all to demonstrate the semblance humans have with animals. Sharing photos and video, he wrote: “We are all animals one way or the other, something drives me crazy about this way of life “it’s too deep for me to explain”. “Interpreting in your own mind is allowed….

You should have all seen the look on mummy’s face”. On several occasions in the past, Pretty Mike has gone out of their way to steal the show at events with his ‘strange creativity’. In December, he attended Eniola Badmus’ birthday party, in the company of semi-nude persons. He also graced an event hosted by Ubi Franklin’s baby mama with a native doctor in August. In 2020, he attended Williams Uchemba’s wedding to Brunella Oscar, with an entourage of six heavily pregnant women. Also, in 2019, he was at an event with four dwarfs carrying a calabash. Finally, in 2017, Pretty Mike was a guest at an event where he was accompanied by a number of ladies on dog leashes, a stunt that got him arrested afterward.
