The Spanish Players’ Union (AFE) has reportedly waded into the dispute between Super Eagles midfielder, Kelechi Nwakali and his Spanish second division side, Huesca. The former Golden Eaglets captain joined the Spanish club back in 2019 from Arsenal, whom he had joined in 2016 from the Diamond Football Academy back home in Nigeria. He’s since made 33 appearances for Huesca and also spent time on loan at Alcorcon.
