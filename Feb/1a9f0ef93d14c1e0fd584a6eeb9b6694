Lanre Shittu Motors said it has taken many dropouts and area boys out of the streets through its auto skill training and employment scheme for school leavers. The auto firm has also extended similar but advanced training skills to young graduates interested in pursuing career in automotive industry. In total, the frontline auto industry player stated that over 450 of such Nigerians have benefitted from the schemes. Executive Director of Lanre Shittu Motors, Taiwo Shittu,  said part of the empowerment scheme of the auto company was to help beneficiaries secure decent jobs with good salaries. He said: “The company has contributed a lot to the economy especially when it comes to manpower, training and empowerment of young Nigerians. We have an empowerment scheme for school leavers who have passion for automotive development. They are trained for a period of four years and get paid even while on training. “After the training, we send them to our customers across the country to service them. We ask them to be employed, accommodated and paid well. In some cases, they are given a car and placed on a good salary that we dictate. We are getting good testimonies from those we sent to Kano, Bauchi, Ondo and Cross River states, among others.

For instance, Desmond Elliot, a member of the Lagos State House of Assembly, sent 10 people from his Surulere constituency to us for the scheme.” He called on the government at various levels to invest and utilise the abundant, but untapped local skills, especially among the youth to develop the automotive assembly industry. According to him, Nigerians have the skills; they just need the support of the government; this is what will make the industry to develop. He stressed the need for the generation of leaders to invest and make sacrifice for the development of the next generation just like the Chinese did. ‘’In those days, many people looked down on the Chinese and derided them for looking haggard and wretched. What they did not know was that, they were making sacrifice for the current generation. Today, the China’s story has changed. Nigeria also needs to do same,” he said.
