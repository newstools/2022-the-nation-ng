Singer Bella Shmurda has opened up on the possibility of someday clinching the music industry’s highest honour, a Grammy. The “Vision 2020” singer in an interview with Do2tun and Eva on the ‘Midday Show’ on Cool FM said he is not in a rush to win a Grammy because he is sure it will come at the right time. According to him, what’s more, important is the extent to which a person is able to impact other people and the music culture at large. The 25-year-old Dangbana Republik frontline act said: “I definitely will work towards winning a Grammy but it not about the award. When you look back what do you see?

That’s what matters the most. Because award will just be at home, your name will be there. “But how much have you done for your people? How well did you help the music itself not even by winning the Grammy. Anybody can win Grammy but what is your contribution? “I still have a lot of work to do. I am not rushing, I am not in a haste. Grammy will come when it’s right but right now, I have to fulfil all righteousness.” SPONSORED
