A member of the Governance Advisory Council in Lagos State, Dr. Oluyomi  Finnih, has advised politicians to be a reference point to the coming generation. Finnih, the Baasegun of Lagos and Vice Patron of the Yoruba Tennis Club, said they should have nothing to hide, “as everything we do on earth is known to our creator, hence the need to stand tall so that people will have good things to say concerning us either here on earth or when we are gone to the great beyond.” He spoke yesterday at an 80th birthday lecture organised for him at the Greetings Hall, Yoruba Tennis Club, Victoria Island, Lagos. Finnih said good behaviour and act of benevolence brought about good names, rather than wealth, hence the need for all and sundry to be selfless, accountable and show elements of integrity.
