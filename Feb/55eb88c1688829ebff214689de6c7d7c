The Abakaliki Division of Ebonyi State High Court yesterday dismissed a suit challenging the defection of Governor David Umahi from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC). The court held that the governor did not flout any provision of the Electoral Act or the Constitution to warrant his removal from office. Umahi had, in November 2020, dumped the PDP, for the APC. The plaintiff, Senator Sunny Ogbuoji, had prayed the court to hold that Umahi, having dumped the PDP, through which he was elected, ought to vacate office upon defection. Ogbuoji, who was APC’s governorship candidate during the 2019 election, prayed the court to order his swearing-in, having come second in the 2019 election.   APC chieftain to Abe: you can’t win without Amaechi     Electoral Act gives Nigeria’s electoral system new dawn,…     Buhari’s successor must continue rail, road, agric projects,…   But Umahi argued that the plaintiff was relying on pre-election/election qualification issues, which should not be. The governor also argued that there is no provision in the Nigerian Constitution which stipulates that defection is one of the grounds for the vacation of office or removal of a governor or deputy governor. . In his judgment, Justice Henry Njoku held that the plaintiff did not come through relevant rules of court to institute the originating summons. The judge held that having regard to Section 188 (1) of the 1999 Constitution, as amended, the defendant (Governor Umahi) had not violated any provision of the Constitution or the Electoral Act in his defection to APC. He also held that with regard to Section 308 of the Constitution, the governor was covered by the Immunity Clause, saying it was wrong to institute criminal or civil proceedings against the office of the governor. Justice Njoku dismissed the suit and awarded N500,000.00 as damages against the plaintiff.
