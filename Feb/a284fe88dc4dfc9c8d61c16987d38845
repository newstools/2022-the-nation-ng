The Sector Commander explained further that officers of the Command would also arrest other motorists found committing offences such as lack of speed limit devices, driving with expired driver’s license, expired tyres and not using seatbelts, among others. “Anyone tested with our equipment and found driving under the influence of alcohol or using intoxicating substances would be arrested and handed over to National Drug Laws Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) for further investigation and prosecution.
