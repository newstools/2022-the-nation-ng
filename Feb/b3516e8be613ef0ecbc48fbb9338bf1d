The Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of Sterling Bank Nig. Plc. Mr. Abubakar Suleiman has pledged more donations to the Lagos State Security Trust Fund (LSSTF). This, he said, was to address insecurity and traffic management in the state. Suleiman spoke while receiving LSSTF management team led by Dr. Abdurrazaq Balogun, the Executive Secretary/ Chief Executive Officer. The Sterling Bank chief urges the agency to come up with a strategy that commits the bank and indeed other corporate organisations to an annual subscription/support for a more structured intervention. According to Suleiman, the visit was very timely as it gave his team a better understanding of the relevance of the agency.   ‘Alternative medicine practitioners must be registered’     Council empowers artisans, aged     400 benefit from skills acquisition in Oyo   - Advertisement - He said the perception that Lagos is the safest state in the country, should not be taken for granted. “The safer a state is perceived to be, the more the need to intensify efforts to keep it that way.  The aftermath of a crime could indeed become more expensive than its prevention,” he said. Balogun said: ‘‘LSSTF has been effective in facilitating safety and security in the state due of its transparency and accountability of showing donors that their monies are being expended judiciously in the procurement of vehicles, logistics and training for the security agencies.” He thanked the bank for the pledge and urged other stakeholders to emulate the bank. The issue of security, Balogun said, was critical with Lagos being a mega city with a daily influx of migrants from other parts of the country and beyond the borders. “The pressure on state infrastructure is huge and there is a higher probability of robbery and violent crimes, not to mention, the increasing issue of drug-related crimes amongst the youths,” Balogun said.   SPONSORED
