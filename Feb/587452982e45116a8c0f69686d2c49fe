Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has asked President Muhammadu Buhari and other African leaders to sanction Russia. Many countries, including the US and its allies had condemned the invasion of Ukraine by Russian military forces and imposed sanctions on Russia. The United States, European Union, Canada and the United Kingdom have agreed to block “selected” Russian banks from the SWIFT global financial network and impose “restrictive measures” on its central bank in retaliation for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The Nation reports civilian and military airports in Ukraine have been bombed by Russia which sought to destroy Ukraine’s air capabilities.
