Former Governor of Oyo State and Osi-Olubadan of Ibadan, High Chief Rasheed Adewolu Ladoja, is a very happy man as we speak. Simply put, he is laughing last and appears to be enjoying it. Why? Olubadan hopeful, Otun Olubadan of Ibadanland, High Chief Lekan Balogun and others who were crowned Obas in 2017, have withdrawn their case challenging a court judgment in favour of Ladoja, on their elevation from high chiefs to Obaship status. Ladoja and the late Olubadan, Oba Saliu Adetunji, had vehemently opposed the promotion and challenged it in court.

The letter read in part: “We are your client in the above suit No: 1/22/2020/. After careful and painstaking consideration of the lingering crisis trailing the succession of the throne of our new Olubadan of Ibadan land, we resolved as follows. That the peace of Ibadan land is paramount in our hearts and as such no sacrifice is too much to be made to achieve the same. That we as kingmakers and members of Olubadan-in-Council have decided to withdraw our above-mentioned suit in High Court of Justice of Oyo State, Ibadan with immediate effect.” The move by Balogun and others, which had become a condition for the Otun Olubadan to ascend the throne of the Olubadan, is no doubt a vindication of Ladoja’s position on the controversial elevation of High Chief to kings in 2017.
