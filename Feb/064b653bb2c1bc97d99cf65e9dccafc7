Former Lagos Governor Akinwunmi Ambode has broken his long silence ahead of the 2023 polls. The 58-year-old governed Lagos from 2015 to 2019 but lost his second term bid to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu at the APC primary. Although Ambode has not announced his intention to contest any political office in 2023, many are insinuating he may vie for an unknown office. Days ago, Ambode inaugurated the turf wicket of Tafawa Balewa Square (TBS) Cricket Oval. Last year, he revalidated his membership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) at Epe ward and was appointed as Deputy Chairman of the South-West subcommittee of the Contact and Strategy Committee of the APC.

The former Lagos governor, in a terse statement shared on his verified social media platforms, thanked supporters for the “overwhelming endorsement” over his “modest contributions” to the growth of Lagos. He said power was in the hands of the youths. Ambode wrote: “After all we have been through, God has been faithful. Thank you for the overwhelming endorsement of our modest contributions to the growth of Lagos. It can only get better for Lagos, and indeed Nigeria. The youths are coming. The power is in their hands. Go and get your Permanent Voters Card (PVC) ready. Your future is NOW!”
