The scheduled arraignment of the ex-Imo Governor Rochas Okorocha and six others was aborted on Tuesday owing to his absence in court. Okorocha was to be arraigned before a Federal High Court in Abuja with the others on a 17-count charge filed by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). Other defendants in the charge marked: FHC/ABJ/CR/28/2021 are: Anyim Nyerere Chinenye, Naphtali International Limited, Perfect Finish Multi Projects Limited, Consolid Projects Consulting Limited, Pramif International Limited, and Legend World Concepts Limited. Okorocha, who represents Imo West Senatorial District, is alleged to have worked with the other defendants to divert public funds estimated at about N2.9 billion. At the mention of the case on Tuesday, Okorocha was absent. - Advertisement -   Mr Macaroni: stop asking when I’ll get married     House of Reps votes March 3 on constitutional amendment     Akwa Ibom Gov sacks Chief of Staff   He was also not represented by any lawyer. The other defendants were in court and represented by lawyers. Lawyer to the EFCC, Cosmos Ugwu told the court that Okorocha has been evading service of the charge on him as required. Ugwu added that security operatives attached to Okorocha have also made it impossible for the court officials to serve the ex-governor personally. “My, Lord, the business of today is ordinarily for arraignment but its regrettable that all efforts on our part to serve the first defendant, Rochas Okorocha have proved abortive. “The security around him has not been helpful and I wish to apply for an adjournment to enable us serve him and then, arraign him,” Ugwu said. Lawyers to the other defendants did not object to Ugwu’s request for an adjournment, following which Justice Inyang Ekwo adjourned till March 28.
