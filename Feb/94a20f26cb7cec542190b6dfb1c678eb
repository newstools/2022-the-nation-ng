All Progressives Congress(APC) national chairmanship aspirant Senator Sani Musa has assured he would return power to youths and ensure internal democracy, if elected. He spoke at the weekend in Abuja, adding he would transform the APC into a self-sustaining and independent corporate entity. According to him: “I want to make the Nigerian youths own Nigerian politics. The time has come for a total overhaul of the political system. “What I would do differently is to initiate a kind of new order in the APC, the first thing I would do as National Chairman is to bring the party to constitutionality. “All the things happening today are because people are not following the rules and due process. - Advertisement - “If today I am the leader of APC I should be looking at faces. I should be able to look you in the eye and tell you the truth. I should be saying you are mine or that you are not mine.

The time has come, if countries that are more democratic can give their political space to everyone why can’t we do the same thing. “Why are we always putting burdens on our governors and elected officials to bring money to fund the party? “That the party is broke. Political parties when you make viable entities should be able to stand on their own. They should be able to be self-sustaining.”
