The House of Representatives has resolved to investigate ongoing recruitment exercises into the Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF) and other agencies under the Federal Ministry of Labour and Productivity. This followed the adoption of a motion by Rep. Ismail Tijani (APC-Kwara), on the floor of the House on Wednesday in Abuja. Tijani stated that the NSITF is currently recruiting for management positions. He alleged that only people from a particular part of the country are being recruited in the current exercise, which negates the principles of Federal Character. According to him, the Minister of Labour and Productivity, Dr Chris Ngige, has been embroiled in a battle to control Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), including the NSITF. He said that the Minister had been summoned by the National Assembly for the alleged misdemeanor in 2016 and 2021 respectively. - Advertisement -   Gunmen kidnap 11 Abia council workers     FEC approves $328.87m for railway consultancy services     Fire engulfs old railway quarters in Kwara   He stated that the summons followed allegations of employment irregularities, impunity, and anomalies indicating gross abuse of office. He said that the current recruitment process at the NSITF, alleged to be biased, could negatively affect the promotion of hardworking staff of the organisation. ”The alleged undue favouritism in the ongoing recruitment exercise at the NSITF could prevent the country from deriving the maximum benefits from the MDAs. The House, therefore, mandated the Committees on Federal Character and Labour, Employment and Productivity to investigate the ongoing recruitment in NSITF and other agencies under it. The lawmakers also recommended appropriate sanctions for anyone found culpable of undue favouritism and asked the committee to report back within four weeks for further legislative action. (NAN)
