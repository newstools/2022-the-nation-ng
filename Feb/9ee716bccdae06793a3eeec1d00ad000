Bello spoke with State House correspondents after a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa. He said the North-Central had suffered exclusion from presidential opportunities more than any region since 1999. Bello was reacting to the position of the Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide that zoning the presidency to the Southeast will remain a fundamental ingredient for national unity.
