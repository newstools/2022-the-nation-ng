The Management of the Plateau State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) has denied advertising for the employment of teachers in the state. Mr Richard Jonah, Head, Public Relations of the board, said this in a statement, on Friday, in Jos. Jonah described the online advertisement entitled: “Plateau State SUBEB Recruitment 2022/2023”, signed by one Ekijah Jonah, as misleading and a ploy to extort unsuspecting members of the public. “The board has not advertised for job recruitment on any media platform in recent times, be it for teaching or non-teaching staff. “The board disassociates itself from the said online advert currently trending on the fake website address.

He said that the management of the board was currently working hard with security agencies to unmasked  those behind this criminal activity and to bring them to book.(NAN)
