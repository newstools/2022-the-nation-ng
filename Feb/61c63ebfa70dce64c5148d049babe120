An Abuja-based human rights lawyer, Pelumi Olajengbesi, has hinted that Sunday Adeyemo, a Yoruba Nation activist popularly known as Sunday Igboho, will soon be released from detention. Although Olajengbesi has since resigned from the team of Nigerian lawyers for Igboho, he advised Yoruba leaders not to be selfish. Igboho has been in detention in Benin Republic since he was arrested at an airport in Cotonou by the country’s security forces while he was trying to flee to Germany in July last year. The 49-year-old agitator fled Nigeria for Benin Republic after the federal government declared him wanted. Despite frantic efforts to get him released, checks by The Nation show he has spent over 201 days in Benin Republic prison. - Advertisement -   Cremate my body when I die – Femi Kuti     Residents panic as dreaded youth gang unleashes mayhem on…     Tukur, Oyebanji, Famodu join board of Fuelmetrics   A Beninise court blocked the extradition of Igboho to Nigeria while ruling that the activist be remanded in prison pending further hearing. His supporters have expressed worries over prolonged stay in detention. Many groups, including Agbekoya Farmers Society, have staged protests to demand the ‘unconditional’ release of Igboho. But reacting yesterday, Olajengbesi, in a terse post on Facebook, said: “Chief Sunday Igboho will be out very soon and there will be massive jubilation across the entire Yoruba land. “He is no doubt a courageous MAN. “This is very authoritative just that our Yoruba leaders should stop being selfish and allow good to prevail.”
