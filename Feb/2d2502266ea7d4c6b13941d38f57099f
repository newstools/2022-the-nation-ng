If he stays with us, it would be wonderful. Otherwise, we will look for solutions. “We have already lost scorers in the past, like Robert Lewandowski or [Pierre-Emerick] Aubameyang. We have found solutions and we would find them again.” Haaland’s contract includes a release clause that could be triggered by any other club in summer and is estimated to be 75 million euros. Meanwhile, several of Europe’s big clubs have already set their sights on the 21-year-old striker.
