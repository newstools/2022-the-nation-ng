Traders in Ochanja Central Market, Onitsha, Anambra State, on Friday protested alleged illegal construction of shops at the central section of the market. The protesters barricaded the headquarters of the state Physical Planning Board in Amawbia, and the entrance of the Government House in Awka, as they displayed placards with various inscriptions. Some of the placards read: “Save our lives now at Ochanja Central Market,” Gov. Willie Obiano; Physical Planning Board why are you people keeping quiet? and “Ochanja Central Market is not for sale.” Addressing newsmen, the leader of the protesters, Chief Gabriel Okwuneme, accused the market leadership of conniving with some government agents to construct additional shops on top of old and weak buildings in the area.
