A Federal High Court in Abuja has fixed April 26 for judgment in a suit by the Chairman, Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT), Danladi Umar with which he seeks to restrain the Senate from hearing a petition accusing of assault and misconduct. A security guard attached to a shopping complex in Abuja, Clement Sargwak had, through his lawyer, last year petitioned the Senate and accused Umar of assaulting and violently attacking him during a disagreement. While the Senate Committee on Ethics, Privileges and Public Petitions began hearing the petition, Umar raced before the Federal High Court to file the suit for among others, to stop the Senate from hearing the petition, arguing that the Senate has no power to probe such cases. He argued that the power to investigate such issues resides only with the police. Defendants in the suit marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/ 671/2021 are the Senate, Senate President, Senate Committee on Ethics, Privileges and Public Petitions and the Attorney General of the Federation AGF.
