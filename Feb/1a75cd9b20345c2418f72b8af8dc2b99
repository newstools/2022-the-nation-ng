Manchester City were denied another win by Tottenham Hotspur as Harry Kane’s masterclass stole the show at the Eithad. City came into the game fresh off the back of a 5-0 demolition of Sporting in the Champions League last-16 first leg. Liverpool closed the gap on Pep Guardiola’s side before kick-off with a 3-1 win over Norwich City, in the 3pm kick-offs. But City were left reeling by a superb Kane showing, as the former City transfer target scored twice — including a late stoppage time goal to win it 3-2.

Guardiola: “I am not superstitious. I said a few weeks ago we need to win many games. Every game will be a big, big battle. We knew it and it will be good to understand how difficult it is. Since October we didn’t lose one game in the Premier League. - Advertisement - “We knew after three defeats they would be back. There was practically no space. After that they could keep the ball and with Kane it gave time to Son who could run. In general we were there all the time. We were there but we couldn’t win.” Spurs simply could not quell the pressure coming down the right from City right in the first half. Soon after Cancelo’s miss, Sterling darted into the box, teeing up Ilkay Gundogan to ratchet a shot against the post. On the left Ryan Sessegnon was at least going out to meet his man, across the pitch Emerson and Hojberg were too willing to drop back to their own penalty area without any semblance of pressure on the ball. There was a balance to be struck, one that was not apparent when Sterling, under no pressure whatsoever, bent a dangerous cross to the edge of the six yard box. SPONSORED
