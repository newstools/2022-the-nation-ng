A woman disguised as a teacher has abducted five children from their homes in Rukpakulusi area of Eliozu in Port Harcourt, Rivers State. Three of the children, aged from 18 months to four years, were reportedly abducted from one family while two others were taken from another family. The mother of three of the children, Rose Monday, said the unidentified woman took her children from their neighbour’s compound where they were playing. She said the suspect claimed to be a home lesson teacher and was looking for a makeshift structure to rent in the area. She said her children were last seen after the woman took them to buy notebooks.

I asked her the whereabouts of her brothers, and she said one Aunty said she would bring them home.” The strange woman was said to have first taken the children along with Mrs Monday’s 14-year-old to Oil Mill market, where she reportedly told the teenager to sit somewhere while she and the missing children went “to get something”. The mother of the two other missing kids, Blessing Emmanuel, said, “This woman told the children that she organised home classes and would like to start teaching the children immediately, if possible. So the grownup child said Aunty let’s go and buy books. “I know the girl and her brothers’ who usually come to my house to play with my children. That is why my children followed them.” Police spokesperson, Grace Iringe-Koko, confirmed the incident, describing the parents of the abducted children as careless. “We have commenced investigation to ensure that the children are rescued, as well as arrest the woman and make her face the law,” she said.
