A group, Concerned Citizen Movement for a Better Nigeria, has called on Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor Godwin Emefiele to dissociate himself from groups championing his presidential ambition. The group urged the CBN governor to avoid distractions and discourage his friends from pushing the 2023 political agenda. It noted that it is disturbing for his friends and associates to pressure him into contesting the 2023 presidential election, while he is occupying a sensitive post, which is key to the nation’s economic stability. The group’s National President Moses Sambo, in a statement, said if Emefiele had presidential ambition, he should resign as governor of CBN. Sambo said his friends should be more concerned about Emefiele stabilising the economy.

The group said due to the high foreign exchange rates, Nigerians have been subjected to hardship as the prices of food have risen by over 50 per cent. “Instead of these friends and associates to push the CBN governor into contesting the 2023 presidential election, they should rather push him into stabilising the economy and reducing hardship in the country”, it said.
