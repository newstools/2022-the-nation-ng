President of the Nigeria Cricket Federation (NCF), Uyi Akpata, said the country’s grounds-men would soon begin consultation for countries like Ghana and Sierra Leone. Akpata said Nigeria’s grounds-men are doing an excellent job in constructing and maintaining cricket pitches around the country, to the admiration of neighbouring nations. “Our grounds-men used the COVID-19 period to gain more experience from a renowned ground official and the NCF seized the opportunity to build our resources during the COVID-19 period,” Akpata explained.“ Luckily, the International Cricket Council presented one of their most prominent ground officials to work virtually with our team, so we have a lot of them who have gained those valuable experiences.”   Joshua gets tips from Fury’s clips     2022 Lagos Int’l Polo Tourney: Emir of Katsina lauds Eko…     Covid-19: NFF regrets Falcons’ shabby treatment   Akpata said the efforts have started yielding dividends since federation was able to construct two wickets in Abuja and Lagos respectively in record time. “It would normally take an average of a year and a half, but we did in eight months,” a visibly happy Akpata said.“ Sierra Leone wants to do its wicket. Ghana is also going to host the African Games in 2023 and cricket will be involved and while ICC is driving it.  “Ghana are going to get support from nearby countries like ours, based on the experience. So it is Nigeria exporting what we have learnt from the ICC to other Africa countries,’’ he noted. It is on record that Nigeria currently has seven international standard turf wickets.
