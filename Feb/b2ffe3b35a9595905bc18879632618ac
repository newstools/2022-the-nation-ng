The Nigerian Navy Ships (NNS) Pathfinder in Rivers has arrested three barges laden with three million litres of suspected crude oil and diesel. It was during its special mission codenamed ‘Operation River Dominance.” The command also said 13 suspected illegal oil refining operators were arrested, with 14 large wooden boats seized. Commander NNS Pathfinder, Rear Admiral Abdullahi Ahmed, in a statement through the Base operation Officer, Commander Umar Sidi, said the special Operation was initiated to support Governor Nyesom Wike’s decision to end bunkering and illegal refining sites and the consequent soot menace. Sidi said: “We have arrested 14 wooden boats that are used in transporting illegally-refined crude. We have also arrested three barges since the campaign began.

He said the command was working with the Akuku-Toru Local Government Area and that the achievements recorded so far were made around the LGA. Chief Press Secretary of the council, Charles Briggs, lauded the Navy for the collaboration and the successes recorded during the operation, including the destruction of illegal refining camps.
