The International Olympic Committee has recommended banning Russian and Belarusian athletes from participating in the Games amid Russia’s attack on Ukraine. In a statement Monday, the IOC’s executive board said that it took the decision despite the Olympic movement’s commitment “not to punish athletes for the decisions of their government if they are not actively participating in them.” “While athletes from Russia and Belarus would be able to continue to participate in sports events, many athletes from Ukraine are prevented from doing so because of the attack on their country,” it said.
