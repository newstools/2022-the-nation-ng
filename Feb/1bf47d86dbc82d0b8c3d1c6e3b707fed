The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has announced that only 18 political parties will take part in the 2023 general election. The commission said it had closed the window for registration of fresh parties to participate in the polls.  It also said the 2023 general election will begin with presidential and National Assembly elections on February 25, while the governorship and State Assembly election will hold on March 11. This followed the commission’s publication of Notice of Election. Speaking exclusively with The Nation, INEC National Commissioner and Chairman of Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, said the commission would not accept or process any new application for the registration of new political parties.
