Precious Chikwendu is not resting in her fight to get full custody of her children from their father, former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode. Days after she petitioned the United Nations (UN), Amnesty International, United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), and United States Agency for International Development (USAID) seeking justice and custody of her children, she is also set to share her life experiences at the Apostolic Roundtable Conference in Lagos.

In December 2021, she even urged a Customary Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) to declare that she was never married to the ex-minister. While inviting Nigerians to the event, the mother of four said they would be speaking about changes in life, politics and policies. She added: “I will be speaking about life and how to carry on with life when you are knocked down by the situation around you.” She went ahead to assure interested persons that they would learn a lot from her experiences and the conference in general.
