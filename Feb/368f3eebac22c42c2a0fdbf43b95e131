According to him, he was in the studio one afternoon when Olamide contacted him and asked if he could leak the song. Fireboy said:“A couple of days after recording Peru, Baddo called me and was like ‘since you’re not ready to drop any single for your fans, we might as well just leak it’. I was in the studio recording and I was like ‘do anything you want, it’s fine. I didn’t take him seriously and I woke up to the song on YouTube and here we are.”
