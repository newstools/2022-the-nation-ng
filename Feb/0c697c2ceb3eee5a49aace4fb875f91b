The APC did win the elections but began a downward slide soon after that, which has deteriorated with the setting up of the caretaker committee.” Abdulkareem expressed worry that a serving governor is controlling the party at the national level, wondering what part of the APC constitution gave Mai Mala Buni the mandate to preside over the affairs of the party.
