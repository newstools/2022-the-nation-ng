Dillian Whyte has signed a contract to fight WBC heavyweight champion, Tyson Fury, just hours before the deadline. The fight is expected to take place on 23 April, potentially at Wembley Stadium. Whyte, 33, had until 06:00 GMT on Tuesday to sign but had spent the weekend and Monday negotiating details of the deal. “Dillian Whyte signed his contract for $8m, what a surprise,” Fury said on social media.

Should this even be a talking point? The man’s signed for the biggest payday he’s going to get in his life.” After lengthy discussions between both teams came to nothing, Frank Warren’s Queensberry Promotions won the purse bids in January with a $41m (£30m) bid, beating Whyte’s promoter Eddie Hearn who was the only other bidder. Fury, 33, is now set to receive 80%, around £20m, of the purse and Whyte the remaining 20%. Fury, who is unbeaten in his pro career with 31 wins and one draw, will now need to seek a boxing licence from the British Boxing Board of Control. BBC
