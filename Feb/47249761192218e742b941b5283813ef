A community source said the attacker, an indigene of Egbema, had been terrorising the area since his escape from the custodial centre. “Since he escaped from the prison he has been terrorising the entire community,” he said, adding that when the community could no longer bear his atrocities they invited the security operatives  to arrest him, but could not track him. “He started killing since last week. Whenever he killed, he ran into the bush,” another resident said. Police spokesman confirmed the incident, saying, “The command is aware of it,” adding that an investigation had been launched into the development.
