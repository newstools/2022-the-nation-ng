Christian Kpatuma. The late ACP, popularly known as ‘HIPPIES’, was allegedly murdered by cultists said to have taken over Agwa. It was gathered that the cultists, who are well known in Agwa, went to his house in the early hours of Wednesday and killed him. A prominent citizen of the community, who sought anonymity, appealed to Governor Hope Uzodimma to bring those who murdered the late assistant commissioner of police to book.

I am greatly pained,” he said. When contacted, Imo Police spokesman, CSP Michael Abattam, said that he has heard about the incident but was yet to get details from the Divisional Police Officer in the area. “I have heard about it, but I want to get the details from the Divisional Police Officer in the area and get back to you,” he said.
