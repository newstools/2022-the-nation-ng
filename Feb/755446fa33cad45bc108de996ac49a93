On the 15 major trends to watch in the sectors, the Chairman of the NBCC Construction and Real Estate Group, Hakeem Ogunniran, said real estate thrives on the back of strong macroeconomic fundamentals and the 25 per cent homeownership rate in Nigeria reflects the challenging environment.

However, technology can be expected to take centre stage in the sector this year, with extremely strong growth prospects for growth in comfort homes, led by demand from first time home buyers, millennials, young families and empty nesters,” he added.
