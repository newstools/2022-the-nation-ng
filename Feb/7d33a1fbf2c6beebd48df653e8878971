Controversy over hijab-wearing by Muslim students in Oyun Baptist High School (OBHS) Ijagbo, Oyun local government area of Kwara state turned bloody on Thursday. One person was feared killed and some others allegedly sustained various degrees of injuries. Unconfirmed sources said that unknown persons armed with dangerous weapons unleashed terror on peaceful protesters at the school. It was gathered the protest was borne out of the January 17th decision of authorities of the school to prevent hijab-wearing Muslim pupils from entering the school. Consequently, the State Government intervened and directed that the status quo be maintained, saying that hijab or beret-wearing should be made optional in all grant-aided schools. - Advertisement - To prevent escalation of the fracas, the State Government announced the closure of the school. Commissioner for Education and Human Capital Development Sa’adatu Modibbo Kawu said: “The state government totally condemns the resort to violence in the government-owned Oyun Baptist Secondary School, Ijagbo, on Thursday. This is totally unacceptable. “The state government unreservedly condemns the flagrant act of discrimination against anyone, especially children, on religious grounds. Such discrimination will not be tolerated in any public-owned institution in the state.
