Everton put on a dominant display against Leeds to earn their first Premier League victory under manager Frank Lampard – ending a run of six league games without a win. It means the Toffees are now five points clear of the relegation zone. Captain Seamus Coleman was the unlikely scorer of the opener, tapping in a rebound from Donny van de Beek’s cross, before Michael Keane headed in another. Anthony Gordon added a third in the second half as Everton wrapped up victory.
