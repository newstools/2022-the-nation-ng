Riyad Mahrez scored twice as Manchester City fought back from a goal down to see off Championship leaders Fulham and book their place in the FA Cup fifth round. City, who are nine points clear at the top of the Premier League and have not lost in domestic competition since October, were given an early fright when Fabio Carvalho turned in Harry Wilson’s cross. Fulham’s lead lasted barely 90 seconds, however, before Mahrez set up Ilkay Gundogan for an assured first-time finish to settle the nerves of the home fans at a sold-out Etihad Stadium. John Stones put City in control soon afterwards when he climbed highest at the near post to head home Kevin de Bruyne’s corner, but they did not finish the tie off for good until the start of the second half.

A few minutes later, Mahrez made it four when he ran on to De Bruyne’s pinpoint pass and saw his shot deflected past Paulo Gazzaniga. That signalled the end of Fulham’s resistance, and they seemed to accept their fate when their 28-goal top scorer Aleksandar Mitrovic was taken off with 15 minutes to go. Only three Premier League teams have scored at Etihad Stadium this season, and only one has taken the lead, so even in defeat Marco Silva’s side still did better than most – but the gulf in class between the two sides eventually told.
