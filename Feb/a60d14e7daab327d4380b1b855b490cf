When one is not close to his people there is no way he will know their problems and how best to tackle them.” On politics, Uzodimma reminded the monarchs in Imo State that ‘’whereas the Nigerian Constitution guarantees everyone freedom of association, that of the traditional rulers have been bridged.’’ He appealed to them not to allow desperate politicians to contaminate them with their sweet tongue.

The Governor reiterated the decision of his government to reconstitute Development Centres, where Town Union Presidents will be made automatic members. “You are ambassadors of your people and the government of Imo State,” he said and prayed for God’s guidance in the monarchs operations, asking them to, above all, “have the fear of God in whatever they do.” In a vote of thanks by the traditional ruler of Umuhu Omuma in Oru East LGA, HRH Eze Dr. Clement Ikechukwu Okonkwo on behalf of the others, he thanked God who using the Governor to make the day a success.
