The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has announced a massive redeployment of staffers across the country. Those affected, according to a statement by INEC National Commissioner and Chairman Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, are either serving in their States of origin or have served for between 10 and 32 years in the same State. The decision, it was gathered, was to ensure efficient and optimal performance. The statement reads in part: “The affected staffers are either serving in their States of origin or have served for between 10 and 32 years in the same State.

In line with the Commission’s existing posting policy, henceforth no Head of Department (HoD) or Electoral Officer (EO) shall serve in his/her State of origin. Furthermore, no staff shall serve for more than two electoral cycles in the same duty post. “Consequently, the Commission has identified 186 staff for immediate redeployment. Among them are 46 HoDs who are either serving in their States of origin or served for more than two electoral cycles in the same State as well as 140 EOs serving in their States of origin or served for more than two electoral cycles in the same State. “The redeployed staffers are to complete the handing and taking over not later than Wednesday 9th March 2022. “This will be an ongoing exercise that will extend to other categories of staff in the Commission’s Headquarters, State and Local Government offices nationwide”.
