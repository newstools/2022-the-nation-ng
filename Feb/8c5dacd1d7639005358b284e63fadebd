Coach Malo’s side hopes to finish the tournament on a good note, and finish in third place, like they did in their last appearance in Gabon 2017. Burkina Faso will also seek revenge against the Indomitable Lions, who won the tournament’s opener 2-1 last month during the group stage. The Burkinabe can celebrate an exceptional tournament after reaching the semifinals, but they remain unsatisfied as they were dreaming of a maiden AFCON trophy. However, a place on the podium might be a consolation. (NAN)
