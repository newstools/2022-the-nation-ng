No fewer than five fire incidents were recorded yesterday in parts of Anambra State, the Director, Fire Service, Mr. Martin Agbili, has said. Agbili, an engineer, said in a statement that most of the incidents were caused by bush burning. He urged residents to always check their surroundings, including cutting and clearing bush around their homes, churches, mosques, markets, schools, among others, to avoid regrets. Agbili said: “About 60 per cent of the fire outbreaks we combated in this dry season were as a result of indiscriminate bush burning that easily spread to structures. “The majority of the bush burning occurred in rural communities where residents, especially hunters, indiscriminately set fire on bushes during the dry season.
