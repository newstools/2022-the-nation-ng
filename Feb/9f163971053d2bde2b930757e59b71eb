Super Eagles’ Interim Technical Adviser, Augustine Eguavoen, said  the appointment of former teammate Emmanuel Amuneke to assist him at the senior national team was  “a very good development”. Eguavoen told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ilorin that the coming of Amuneke would be a great addition to the quality of the team’s coaching. It would be recalled  that the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) had on Monday announced changes to the composition of the Eagles’ technical crew. While Eguavoen is to continue on as head of the crew, Amuneke was added to the team, just as former national under-20 team coach Paul Aigbogun was dropped. Amuneke is to work as the chief coach and Eguavoen’s first assistant, with Salisu Yusuf as second assistant/chief coach of the CHAN Super Eagles. Joseph Yobo is the Third Assistant, while Aloysius Agu is the Goalkeepers’ Trainer.

I think his coming into the team will add a lot of value also,” Eguavoen, who led the Super Eagles to a round of 16 finish at the 33rd Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Cameroon, said. Eguavoen also said any Nigerian playing in any of the national league competitions in the country can get a chance to play for the national team.  “Once we get information on a player, I will go round to watch him. And not just me, a couple of my colleagues are also watching.  “That gives the home-based players a lot of hope and thinking that they will get a chance one day to play in the Super Eagles,” he said.
