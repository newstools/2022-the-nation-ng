Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida says Japan will mull new measures for adoption in the event of the deterioration of the situation around Ukraine. He said it on Wednesday while commenting on Russia’s recognition of the Donetsk and Luhansk Republics (DPR, LPR). Earlier, Kishida had announced a set of sanctions over the recognition of the Donbas Republics, which included ban on the issuance of visas and freezing capitals of residents of DPR and LPR. He said that it would also ban Japan’s export-import relations with the republics as well as its placement and operations with the new sovereign debt of the Russian government in Japan.
