After his impressive contribution to the Rangers’ 5-0 bashing of Hearts in the Scottish Premier League (SPL), coach Gio van Bronckhorst has lauded Joe Aribo and his teammates for their superb response at the weekend. The Dutchman labelled himself as ‘very pleased’ with his players’ reaction to their midweek disappointment. The Light Blues were in sparkling form to defeat the Jambos, and could even have added to the five goals they claimed on the night. Aribo, who featured for 76th minutes before being replaced by Fashion Sakala was on hand to deliver for the team in their superb display against the visitors. Speaking afterwards to RangersTV, van Bronckhorst said: “First of all, I am very pleased with the victory and the three points after the last week and I think we did it in a good way.   2022 NPA/ GTBank Lagos International Polo Tournament     Bundesliga play-off race: Aruna ‘s TTC suffers setback     Action resumes at refurbished TBS Cricket Oval   - Advertisement - “I am very happy with the goals we scored but also our overall attitude during the game with a lot of energy, a lot of spirit and that is why we won today with a 5-0 win. “[Energy and intensity] are the basics in football. Today, it was really good and we were very sharp and ready for the battle we knew we could face against Hearts and we performed really well. “It is good as it gives us confidence, especially with the way we played and the way we scored the goals. “That gives us confidence for the next game – we prepare game after game and of course, the 5-0 victory will help to prepare for Hibs on Wednesday but the players knew we had to react and we did. “I am pleased with the performance of the whole team, but you have to have the threat in front of the goal and with the different players that scored today, it was very important for us as we want the threat to come from all areas of the pitch.”
