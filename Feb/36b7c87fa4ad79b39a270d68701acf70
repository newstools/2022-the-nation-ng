A public health nurse, Mrs Mojirade Kehinde, has described liver cancer as a silent epidemic that was becoming increasingly common among Nigerians. Kehinde said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Friday, in Ibadan. “Liver cancer is an increasingly common form of cancer that can go undetected and untreated. It is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths globally,” she said. According to her, excessive alcohol consumption, smoking and hepatitis infection can lead to liver cancer.

Kehinde identified some of the symptoms of liver cancer as abdominal pain, loss of appetite and sudden weight loss. “Usually, liver cancer is not discovered until it is too late to be treated effectively. “Therefore, it is important to have a regular health check-up and reduce the risk of this condition,” she said. She advised Nigerians to shun unhealthy lifestyles, and not indulge in habits that could endanger their health. (NAN)
