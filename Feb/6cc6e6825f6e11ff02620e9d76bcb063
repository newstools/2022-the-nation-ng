Foremost music producer, Olumide Ogunade, known as ID Cabasa, in music circles has said that human beings also have the ability to be like God. He made this statement during a live session recently. Cabasa said since humans were created in God’s image, God has blessed human beings with diverse abilities which include being everywhere at the same time just like the creator. He stressed that being everywhere in his terms doesn’t have to be physical but one’s network of friends and business partners represents their presence in different locations.

It looks so huge that we say we can’t be everywhere at the same time but I realize we can actually do it and I am talking about the power of your network, the kind of people you surround yourself with.” Going further, Cabasa said: “I realise that if I know so many people that are doing stuff in different spheres of life I can actually be everywhere at the same time though I’m in my house. “For instance, each time people call me and ask for certain services, most times I have somebody that I can call that will do stuff for people and I realise that it’s almost the same thing when people say God is everywhere at the same time. Make sure you have the needed people in your network.”
