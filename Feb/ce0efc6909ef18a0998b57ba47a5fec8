Gembu is a community that is about 4000ft above sea level and the feedback we have received from these communities was enormous. “In all the places we have been to, our target is to have 500 students per centre. We call them the FEED centres. For those students there, we have 26 subjects in all, 14 subjects in the senior secondary and then 12 for the junior secondary. “We are looking at at least 50 students per centre. “We should be getting over 1, 000 students or more for this first stage. The campaign started in December,” he said.
