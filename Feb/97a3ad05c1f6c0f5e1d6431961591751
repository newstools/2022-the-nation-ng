Going by the account of Governor Babagana Zulum, about 900,000 houses, 5,000 classrooms and 800 public buildings have been lost by Borno State to insurgency. The municipal infrastructures destroyed by terrorists are included police stations, traditional rulers’ houses and local government secretariats, among others. Prof Zulum made the revelation during a visit to Zamfara State in solidarity with Governor Bello Matawalle over the recent activities of bandits in the Northwest state. He said: “We lost a total of about 900,000 to the insurgency. We lost about 5,000 classrooms in Borno State, 800 municipal buildings comprising police stations, traditional ruler houses, and local government secretariats. These are official figures; unofficial figures are more than this.” Responding, Governor Matawalle commended Zulum for the concern and finding the time to visit Zamfara despite his own problems in Borno state.
