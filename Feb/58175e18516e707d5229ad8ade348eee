UKRAINE-BASED Ghanaian defender Najeed Yakubu has expressed concern over the current conflict between Ukraine and Russia. Tension between the two nations has heightened over the last few days after the Russian military entered Ukraine, disturbing the regular order of life. Former Ghana U17 and U20 right-back Yakubu, who currently plays club football for Vorskla Poltava, is one of many frustrated Ghanaian nationals, including over 1000 students, caught up in Ukraine.

This morning, I woke up to the news [of the attack]. They [club] sent an emergency message that there wouldn’t be training and that we should stay at home and be safe. I called my friends in the city that was attacked and they said this is not a movie, it’s serious,” Yakubu told Citi Sports on Thursday. “I am about an hour-and-a-half away from Kharkiv, a city that’s been attacked. We’re just confused and we’re stuck here. Nothing is working; no banks, trains, taxis, airports or restaurants, nothing. “Everything is finished in the shops. We don’t know what to do. We have to move as soon as possible but how can we? We are stuck here. Yakubu has been based in Ukraine for the last four years.
