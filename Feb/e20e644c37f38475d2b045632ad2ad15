Liverpool won at bottom-of-the-table Burnley to record a fourth consecutive Premier League victory as they seek to stay in touch with leaders Manchester City. In testing conditions at Turf Moor, Fabinho scored the game’s only goal just before half-time, the midfielder stabbing the ball home from a corner.
