But unfortunately Lagos today has only one state university that was given to us about 39 years ago. So, we are happy to come to NUC today to pick two brand new university approvals for the people of Lagos State.” He noted that his administration had invested extensively in the existing institutions that have been upgraded with one of them having over 60 Ph.D. lecturers while their infrastructures are being developed aggressively. “We believe that the approval to have Lagos State Polytechnic turned to University of Science and Technology, will bring about innovations in engineering, science, inventions, and things that would bring development to our country and state,” he said. The executive secretary of NUC dismissed claims of the proliferation of universities in Nigeria, insisting that Nigeria with over 200 million citizens requires more universities to cater for the tertiary education needs. He noted that Nigeria currently has an enrolment of two million students in the existing 200 universities, saying this was quite low when compared to the number of candidates who seek admissions into universities annually.
