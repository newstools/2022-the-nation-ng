Speaking to The Nation, the Chief Executive, Agricultural and Rural Management Institute (ARMTI), Dr Olufemi Oladunni noted that a lot is required   to raise the national oil seeds production volume. - Advertisement - A key component of improving production, according to him is   to give smallholders better access to high-yielding seeds. He posited that  there are  plenty of business opportunities across domestic, regional and international markets, for oil seed farmers. He added that farmers face considerable challenges in modernizing the industry to increase yields, exports and value-added processing. He urged for  wide-reaching efforts to  see production levels of key crops return to growth in the coming years, helping boost value-added processing in the sector.
