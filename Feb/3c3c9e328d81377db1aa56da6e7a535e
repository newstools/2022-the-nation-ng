It is no longer news that Senate Deputy Minority Leader, Emmanuel Bwacha, has dumped the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the governing All Progressives Congress (APC). But what’s new is that the Taraba legislator may have abandoned his old haunt after realising his governorship aspiration would be ‘dead on arrival’ should he remain in PDP. Bwacha, who confirmed he quit to escape “apparent persecution” of the state governor, Darius Ishaku, hinted of his desire to succeed the governor last month.   2023 and zoning battle cry     Winter Olympics gets underway in Beijing     Constitution review report ready end of February, says…   But observers of the politics of the state told Sentry that there is no way Bwacha will run as the gubernatorial candidate of the PDP with Ishaku as incumbent and leader of the party in the state. “They are not on good terms and the governor is not hiding his opposition to the Senator’s undeclared 2023 ambition,” a source claimed. Confirming the above claim, Bwacha himself recently said, “We (Ishaku and I) worked together in 2015 but in 2019, suddenly this hate came. I tried to speak to him about issues but it had always earned me hate. I tried to see him at a point but he shut the door at me,” he said, adding that past and present leadership of the PDP didn’t help reconciliatory efforts.” - Advertisement - So, for Bwacha, dumping PDP may simply be a case of making hay while the sun shines.
