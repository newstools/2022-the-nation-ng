I have enjoyed the blessing of relationships but the truth remains, no one can outdo family. “I am grateful for the sacrifices you all have to make for my pursuit, the most profound being how you have to take from your individual businesses to fund the operation of Rochas Foundation, even though most of you have your charity organisations that take your monies. “I am grateful for all the years you have understood me and encouraged me to go on in the midst of the slander. I am most grateful for how you see my humanity, and you see my heart.” SPONSORED
