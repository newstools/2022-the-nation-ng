The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has said the 2022 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) mock examination will now hold on April 9, and not on April 16, as earlier scheduled. The board announced this in its Weekly Bulletin of the Office of the Registrar yesterday in Abuja. JAMB said the change was due to the realisation that April 16, earlier scheduled, will fall on Easter Saturday; a holy Saturday celebrated by Christians to mark the end of the Lent period before Easter Sunday. The board also noted that the date for the exercise had been affected by the shift in date for the registration of the UTME and Direct Entry (DE), which was earlier scheduled for February 12, but later started on February 19. But it urged all candidates who registered and would want to sit for the mock exercise to note the change of date and be prepared.

The UTME, however, has been scheduled by JAMB to hold from May 6 to May 16. Also, JAMB said it had made significant progress in the ongoing registration of candidates for the 2022 exercise. According to the board, it has successfully registered over 236,000 candidates as of February 26, eight days after the commencement of the registration on February 19. The board, while comparing the statistics with its 2021 exercise, said it registered only 102,221 candidates within same period of eight days in the 2021 exercise. JAMB attributed the improvement to its partnership with the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC), adding that the seamless process had yielded the desired results.
