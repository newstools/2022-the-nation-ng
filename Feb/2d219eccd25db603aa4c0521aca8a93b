Former child actor, Williams Uchemba has lamented over the lifestyle of babies. The popular actor, who welcomed his first child on Sunday, February 13 jokingly decried babies’ lifestyle which he considers extremely exhausting. According to the comic act, babies’ lifestyle follows a pattern which includes eating, poo-ing, crying and farting. When asked the question ‘Have you met babies?’, Uchemba begins his exposition on babies. He said: “A human being. All you have to do is poo eat, sleep, wake up, cry, eat, poo, poo, poo again, eat, eat again, sleep, wake up, cry, sleep, wake up, eat.
