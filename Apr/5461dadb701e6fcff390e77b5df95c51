Chelsea head coach Thomas Tuchel “does not know why” his side “stopped defending” during their shock 4-1 home defeat by Brentford on Saturday afternoon. Tuchel’s side took the lead in the 48th minute through Antonio Rudiger but were stunned by three goals in 10 minutes from Brentford, who were 3-1 up on the hour thanks to two goals from Vitaly Janelt and one from Christian Eriksen. With Chelsea chasing the game to no avail, substitute Yoane Wissa added Brentford’s fourth in the 87th minute.

We were not aware enough of the danger, were sloppy with the defending, and got punished. “They made the most of it in those 10 minutes. Right after their third goal, we had 10 minutes where we had big, big chances and we missed them. “They were lucky and clinical enough to get three goals. We did not defend like it is needed to in the Premier League and got punished.”
