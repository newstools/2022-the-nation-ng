Rangers manager Giovanni van Bronckhorst was on media duties on ahead of  his side’s Europa League quarterfinal, second leg clash against Braga at Ibrox Stadium tonight. For the first time since August 29, 2021, Calvin Bassey was omitted from a matchday squad for a Scottish Premiership game as Rangers thrashed St Mirren 4-0 at the weekend. Van Bronckhorst explained before the start of the game at St. Mirren that the Super Eagles left-back was given a rest with an eye on today’s match against Sporting Braga. The Dutch football tactician was asked to provide an update on Bassey and another player who sat out the game vs St Mirren, Ryan Jack and if they are okay to feature tomorrow. Van Bronckhorst told reporters at the pre-match press conference: “Yes, both are available for tomorrow”. The 22-year-old Bassey has gone the distance in each of the last seven matches played by Rangers in this season’s Europa League, and was one of the club’s standout players despite the 1-0 loss to Braga in Portugal six days ago.
