A brother of late gospel singer, Osinachi Nwachukwu, Chiemerie, has said that the late singer refused to divorce her husband, Peter Nwachukwu  because her followers might perceive her negatively if she quit the relationship. He said she did not want people to describe her as a divorced minister. Chiemerie accused Nwachukwu of killing the singer slowly.

She was very quiet and God-fearing. “She was just hiding all these things so people will not talk about her and say she is divorced. So, the man was dealing with her and she was dying slowly.” He reported a case of culpable homicide to the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Police against Nwachukwu, which led to his arrest on April 10. The gospel singer gave up the ghost on April 8.
