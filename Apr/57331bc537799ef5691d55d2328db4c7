Femi Fagbemi’s entertainment outfit that tells authentic African stories via games, Divisions.africa, has launched a board game ‘One Chance’. Fagbemi, the creator of ‘One Chance’ hinted that the new game reflects an authentic Lagos experience filled with chance encounters, especially traffic. “One Chance is equally as educational as it is fun, I hope we can arm people with financial literacy tools while they are also having fun and making money. It mimics our real-life experiences and I hope people make smarter decisions from their experiences after playing.”   Loverboy returns with Igbese     2baba, Rema, Cavemen, set to thrill fans on Afrikashrine TV     Why I returned to school, by Zaaki Azzay   Continuing Fagbemi said, “There are financial and life lessons I learnt from my parents while growing up. Experiences like what and when to invest. I took some and discarded others, to my regrets. But I want to pass on the same lessons to people especially those who are just making their way up in life.” On the motive for inventing the game, Fagbemi stressed that ‘One Chance’ is poised to change Nigeria’s negative stories for the better. “There is hardly anyone who lives either in Lagos or any of the big cities that has not had One Chance experience and it doesn’t have to be a car robbery scenario but all our experiences both good and bad. “So, I felt why not recreate these experiences and see how we can entertain ourselves with it and most importantly learn life lessons from them. OneChance game is about the lessons, reinventing our minds and thinking about how we can change our negative stories for the better,” he said.
