THE Asun Carnival Destination made its debut last year. The event was packaged by the President of La Campagne, Otunba Wanle Akinboboye, and its success made the Ondo State government later adopt it. The second edition will take place on May 2 at the Ondo Township Stadium. Guests, local communities, and other attendees will be treated to entertaining events, including street parades by the revellers and different bands. Akinboboye said the event would energise the economy of the town and Ondo by engaging the youth and other segments of the society in meaningful ventures.
