Former Governor of Anambra State and presidential aspirant of the Peoples Democratic Party, Mr. Peter Obi, has advised the party’s delegates to collect money offered by aspirants but to think about their children’s future when voting for their preferred candidate. Obi who said he was on a mission to stop monetization of political process in the country said he would not give money to delegates. He spoke on Sunday in Akure while he addressed Ondo State delegates as part of his nationwide tour to woo party delegates ahead of the primary. The former Anambra Governor tasked the delegates to question past antecedents of the aspirants. He said Nigerians need somebody with capacity, good behaviour and character as their president and not just ability to talk and make promises.

He said, “Collect the money but when you go to vote think about the future of your children. You are delegates today, you cannot be delegates forever. We cannot continue this way. If we do not do anything, it will consume all of us. “Asked question about the aspirants. Asked about where they were 15 years ago. We want people with capacity, behaviour and character to be our president. “People now spend their revenue on feeding. Unemployment rate is on the high side. We are borrowing without investing it. The problem with Nigeria is that we are borrowing for consumption. The country is unproductive. We want to see things work.” On the issue of consensus, he said, “Nigerians want consensus on somebody who will solve the problem of Nigeria. We want to move this country from consumption to production. We want somebody that can do the work, who will start working for Nigeria.”
