The senator representing Adamawa South, Binos Yaroe, has flagged off a three-day free medical outreach in Lamurde local government area. Lamurde is the 9th and the last LGA his outreach would cover in the nine-LGA Adamawa Southern Zone which the senator represents. Yaroe recalled to newsmen in the course of the Lamurde outreach which entered its 2nd day Tuesday that he started the free medical outreach in Demsa LGA in 2019. He said commissioned a mobile clinic that would reach where the regular outreach could not get to.

He stated about 30% of all the cases are eye challenges, for which reason a grand finale for only people with eye problems will be conducted by the senator in the nearest future. Shedding light on the organisation of the outreaches, Dr Dah said he coordinates the process by putting together the doctors and other medical personnel from across the country and arrange for the supply of drugs and other needs, but that Senator Binos Yaroe provides all the funds. “The senator is responsible for all the bills, including cost of drugs, transportation, equipments, accomodation, feeding and the honorarium involved in the medical outreaches,” he said.
