Since the abduction of about 276 Chibok schoolgirls in Borno State by Boko Haram, over 1,500 school children have been kidnapped by armed groups in Nigeria. Human rights group, Amnesty International (AI), stated this in an investigation. “Nigerian is failing to protect vulnerable children. By refusing to respond to alerts of impending attacks on schools across the north of the country, the Nigerian authorities have failed to prevent mass abductions of thousands of school children,” AI’s Nigeria Director Osai Ojigho said in a statement yesterday by the organisation. AI faulted Nigerian authorities for failing to learn from the Chibok incident and preventing further crimes. “In all cases, the Nigerian authorities have remained shockingly unwilling to investigate these attacks or to ensure that the perpetrators of these callous crimes face justice.

He added: “The Nigerian authorities must urgently comply with the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child to which it is a state party. “They must take concrete steps to prevent the abduction of children and ensure that those suspected of criminal responsibility face justice in fair trials and rescue the hundreds of children who remain in captivity.” According to AI, the attacks on schools have triggered a shutdown of many learning institutions. “As a result, affected regions have seen a decline in school enrollment and attendance, as well as a rise in child marriage and pregnancies of school-age girls,” the statement added.
