Oba Saheed Elegushi of Ikate Kingdom in Lagos State has described the death of the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi as the end of an era. Elegushi said this in a condolence message on Sunday by his Special Assistant on Public Affairs, Mr Temitope Oyefeso, to the Oyomesi and the people of Oyo Kingdom. He said that the traditional institution in Nigeria and the black race had lost a strong pillar and a notable voice that symbolises the true essence of culture and tradition. “Without doubt, this is the end of an era. Alaafin’s passing is the closure of a glorious chapter in our traditional institution.   ‘How I emerged Rivers APC gov consensus…     States lost N28.15bn IGR between 2019 – 2020, says NGF     NUC approves accreditation of 21 undergraduate programmes at…   “He was a king and a leader that preached culture, he demonstrated it and he was repository of knowledge on our cultural values and ethos that we all look up to,” Oba Elegushi said. The traditional ruler said that his relationship with the late Alaafin was that of a father and son and despite their difference in age and years on the throne, Alaafin accorded him the respect and was always available each time he sought his advice or counsel. Elegushi said that with the transition of Alaafin, all traditional rulers in Yoruba land must come together and ensure that the legacies for which Alaafin lived, which are the rich Yoruba cultural values and ethos were preserved and passed onto the next generation. Elegushi said, “I want to appeal to all the kings in Yoruba land to come together and ensure that our values and culture does not extinct. We must make effort to pass on to the next generation, the rich tradition and cultural values bequeathed to us by our forefather.” Adeyemi, who ruled for 52years as the Alaafin of Oyo kingdom, died on Friday at the age of 83.
