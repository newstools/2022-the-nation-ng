Ahead of the Week 34 of the Italian Serie A tie, former Napoli defender Ruud Krol said coach Luciano Spalletti should pair Victor Osimhen and Dries Mertens against Empoli this weekend. Despite several calls for a striking partnership of Osimhen and Mertens, Spalletti continues to use them separately to the chagrin of Napoli fans but Krol, the 73-year-old former Dutch International believed the duo can bolster their scoring prowess in the club’s quest for European competition next season. “Spalletti? I like his football,” Krol told Gazzetta dello Sport.“ Napoli played very well at the beginning of the season, it was spectacular but now they don’t look like the same team. “For example, I like Osimhen a lot but those who think he is a counter-attacker are wrong. “He is very strong in the head and faster than everyone in the box. If he played with another striker next to him, he would score more.

I recommended him to the club when he was at PSV and remains very strong. Dries could give a good hand upfront,” the Dutchman said. Similarly, Radio Kiss Kiss Napoli has touted the paring of Osimhen and Mertens as the best for Napoli. “When Victor Osimhen plays with Dries Mertens in support, Napoli attacks better,” claimed the influential radio station.“ As a matter of fact, it is enough to make a comparison between the various matches of the season. “ And then there are the numbers to testify: six goals in 170 minutes together, with an average of one goal every 29 firsts, better than any other couple in Serie A. “ “Who knows if this figure is not able to convince Luciano Spalletti too.” Meanwhile, Livio Marinelli has been named as the centre referee for the Week 34 of the Serie A between Empoli and Napoli.
