According to the source: “I now respect our security men, they are gallant indeed. I thought those criminals would finish them up but they responded immediately and they ran away with their vehicles. “But by then, three of them were already lying on the floor because we were watching them from upstairs.” Anambra Police spokesman Ikenga Tochukwu confirmed the gun battle when contacted. “Yes, I heard there was a shoot out at Agulu, I’m still waiting to receive the details, which, for now are sketchy. Until I receive it in full, I will not be able to talk further on the incident,” the spokesman said. Sent from Yahoo Mail on Android
