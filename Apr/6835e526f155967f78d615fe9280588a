Balogun urged them to be genuine and sincere in their worship of Allah through their fasting and prayers during the period.

Oba Balogun urged them to spare a thought for the less privileged in the society in whatever they do in order to make the season profitable physically and spiritually. He stressed that the purpose of the holy season would be lost if they care less about the welfare of the less privileged around them. He noted that with love, care and concern for others, the society would be better, safe and conducive for all to live, adding: “the country is today in much pains and stress because of lack of love and care for the generality of the people. ”As Muslims, I urge all to use this moment of solemnity to reflect on our respective and personal lives and make the necessary amends wherever we are found wanting towards making others happy and creating a more lively and lovely environment”, he added.
