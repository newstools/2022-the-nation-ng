A 14-man Main Organising Committee (MOC) was yesterday inaugurated by the Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare in Abuja with the charge to stage a seamless tournament in Asaba, the Delta State capital. The MOC will be chaired by the Permanent Secretary in the ministry, Ismail Abubakar while the Secretary to the Delta State Government Patrick Ukah is the vice-chairman. According to Dare, who was represented by his permanent secretary Ismail Abubakar, the MOC has less than seven months to stage a befitting sports fiesta in collaboration with the Local Organising Committee (LOC) in Delta State. He said the MOC would oversee the affairs of the competition while urging them to put together a successful sports fiesta in line with international best practices.

Dare said over 15000 athletes and officials would be part of the tournament while lamenting that the sole funding of the tournament rests on the federal and state governments, adding that, “this trend is unacceptable and cannot be allowed to continue.” He, however, appealed to private and corporate organisations to support sports in the country with the aim of promoting their goods and services. He tasked the MOC to ensure that the festival attract sponsors. Among the MOC members include Paul Oyeudo, Simon Ebhojiaye, Abba Yola, Patrick Okeke, Tunji Okedairo, Olufehinti Joshua, Mohammed Manga, Olawale Moronkola, Habu Gummel, Emico Eruwa, Maizare Ahmed, Sherif Olawuyi, Peter Nelson (secretary-general) and Meg Unah (assistant secretary-general).
