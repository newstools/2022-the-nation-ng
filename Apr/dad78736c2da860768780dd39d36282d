The new Customs and Excise Management Act amendment bill recently passed into law by the House of Representatives has granted the service the power to detain any aircraft or ship that fails to comply with the laws of the land in terms of export and import of goods. The bill, when it eventually becomes law, will also impose a fine of N20 million on persons found to have constructed or encouraged the construction of illegal routes and tunnel into and out of the country and another fine of N10 million on owners of land where such tunnels are constructed. As a way of discouraging smuggling and enhancing revenue for government, the bill encourages the establishment of a joint border patrol among Customs Services of Nigeria and neighboring countries. It also criminalised the manufacturing of carbonated drinks ad tobacco related products without an approved license from the Customs service, while also making it mandatory for the Customs service to issue licenses for the operation of warehouses where goods are to be kept. The bill, which is awaiting concurrence from the Senate before being transmitted to the President for assent, states that “an officer, if it appears to him that an aircraft is intended or likely to depart for a destination outside Nigeria from any place other than a Customs control zone otherwise than as permitted in writing by the Service before Customs clearance is given there from, may give such instructions and take such steps by way of detention of the aircraft or otherwise as appear to him necessary in order to prevent the departure. “Any person who contravenes any instructions given under subsection (1) of this section shall be liable to a fine of N5 million or to imprisonment for three years, or to both; and if the aircraft flies in contravention of any such_ instruction’ or notwithstanding any steps taken to prevent the flight, the operator of the aircraft and the captain thereof shall, without prejudice to the liability of any other person under this subsection, each shall be similarly liable unless he proves that the flight took place without his consent or connivance.” It added: “Where goods are loaded into any ship, aircraft or vehicle for exportation or as stores are unloaded in Nigeria without a written authorization, the master of the ship, the captain of the aircraft, or any person In charge of the vehicle without authorization, shall upon conviction, be liable to a fine of N50 million or ten years imprisonment, and the goods shall be forfeited.” The bill allows the Nigeria Customs Service to cooperate with the Customs Administrations of countries that share borders with Nigeria to enhance revenue collection, compliance with international trade rules, prevention and suppression of smuggling, law enforcement and improved trade facilitation. In doing so, they are to enter into a Memoranda of Understanding with cooperating Customs Administrations of borders countries setting out the respective responsibilities of the signatories to such memoranda.
