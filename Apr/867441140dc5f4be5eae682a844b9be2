Actress Annie Idibia has chided envious family members working against others. She reposted a video of American ultra-marathon runner and public speaker David Goggins to buttress her point on Insta’s story. In the video, Goggins said: “A good human being, a fulfilled human being doesn’t need to break anyone down. All they do is want to build you up. “So anybody you meet that calls you out of your name, that bullies, that messes you up, that makes you feel not lifted, they are dealing with something deep-rooted.” Captioning the video, the 37-year-old 2Baba’s wife wrote: “Some families, some partners…staff!!! Live and let’s live. Go on with your perfect lives.   Men who monitor how women spend red flags – Ka3na     Wizkid was nominated in wrong Grammy categories, says Naomi…     Five ex-BBNaija housemates making waves in Nollywood   “So easy and exciting to believe the worst about a person. But your dark, envious, evil hearts won’t let you believe the good news or when they did things to make you happy and comfy in their space. “U hate so deep u forget how to love your own. Sad…when they were there for you. #onMyLane”. This is coming days after Annie’s Idibia eldest brother, Wisdom Macaulay took to his Instagram page accusing her of being a drug addict and introducing him to the same. Wisdom also accused his younger sister of exploitation and financial strangulation among other things. He made a U-turn a few days after as he apologised to Annie over the allegations leveled against her while blaming depression for his outburst.
