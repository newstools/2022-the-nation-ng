We feel we should do everything to ensure he wins his second term bid,” he said. The commissioner urged his fellow defectors to ensure Makinde is re-elected in 2023. He said ADC structure still remained intact, explaining that only elected and political appointees on the party’s platform were joining the PDP. ADC was one of the coalition parties that worked to deliver victory for Makinde in the 2019 general election.
