Being wealthy is a process, procedure that I believe is the universal truth. It is a divine process that youths must accept. “It is quite unfortunate that we are being plagued by quick-money or the get-rich menace and, the major culprits caught up in this web of vices are the youths”. The university of Lagos graduate pointed out most youths believe in the fast life, ignoring the process. “Imagine a 16-year-old boy eager to drive a Bentley, ignoring the process of getting wealthy. Where is the virtue? Hard work, contentment, and waiting on God should be the anchor,” he stressed. Labule has three hit tracks ‘Smartie’, Gbegbese’ and ‘Zero’ to his name.
