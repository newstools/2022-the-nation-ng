I would have been behavioural scientist, says Rita Dominic     My dad insists on getting degree – rising act Dannyello     TAYO SOBOLA: Being a hard worker has kept my husband   This is coming after allegations that the late gospel singer, Osinachi Nwachukwu had some celebrities weighing in on the issue of domestic violence against women in marriages. Charity took to her social media pages to express her thoughts on the reason why some women gave such fate. She said: “Sometimes it’s usually a very big threat to an average African man for his wife to be richer than him. Men must learn to accept this fact, grace May depart from you it’s ok for your wife to pick up and continue the race but the African mentality in these men will always make them feel the woman is intimidating them with her position or wealth so the only way them maintain their stance is to be violent. It’s just a pity. So where is the mate God talked about.”
