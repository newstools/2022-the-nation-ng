The Northern Democratic Defense League (NDDL) has bashed Sokoto Governor Aminu Tambuwal for denying knowledge of the process that produced consensus candidates for People’s Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidates from the north. It said such denial “further testifies with Tambuwal’s inconsistent inconsistencies.” The group, in a statement, by its coordinator, Auwal Liti Darazo, said the exercise L by eminent elders in the region which pruned the number of northern PDP presidential aspirants was judicious and the outcome fair and credible. Referring to Tambuwal’s optimism just two days before the outcome of the process that consensus arrangement was healthy for the PDP and would favour him, the group said it is inconsistent and shameless for the Sokoto Governor to deny going through the exercise.   2023: Tinubu, Sanwoolu have done enough to win for APC…     2023: The trouble within Oyo PDP     Delta 2023: Omo-Agege’s mother of all declarations   The statement noted that in place of the barefaced lies and denial of the process by Tambuwal, the group of eminent elders and leaders of the region deserves respect particularly from him being the sole initiator of the consensus process while commending the aspirants for their courage for standing firm for justice, fairness and inclusiveness. “The simple fact that the elders have so patriotically submitted that other zones of the Zone which have not had the opportunity should be considered this time around, speaks volumes for their integrity, selflessness, patriotic love for the North and for country. “It is therefore contradictory that Tambuwal who claims the ability to unite the whole country should also be the one fuming over an exercise in inclusivity that tilts towards zones that have previously been deprived of such opportunities, ” the group said. It hailed the other co-aspirants who patriotically submitted to the process and kept to their gentleman pledge to abide by its outcome and to work for the general victory of the party and promotion of democratic ideals in the country.
