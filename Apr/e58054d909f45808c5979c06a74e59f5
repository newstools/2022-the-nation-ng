Traditional rulers in Akure North Local Government Area of Ondo State have faulted the legal advice by Ondo Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Sir, Charles Titiloye, on the judgement of a High Court regarding the prescribed authority of the Deji of Akure, Oba Aladetoyinbo Ogunlade. The Akure North monarchs, under the aegis of Council of Obas and Registered Trustees of Olus and Baales in Akure North, described the legal advice as misinterpretation of the judgement delivered in March, 2018. They claimed the judgement in contention never declared the Deji of Akure as the prescribed authority of any community in Akure North Local Government Area.

The Akure North monarchs, in a letter to Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu signed by their lawyer, Barrister Femi Emodamori, said the legal advice was orchestrated and compromised in favour of the Deji of Akure. According to them: “It would however lead to disastrous breakdown of peace and order in the state unless it is immediately withdrawn. “Consequently, our clients are calling on Your Excellency to direct the immediate withdrawal of the fraudulent legal advice, and order an inquiry into the circumstances or motives behind its issuance as well as those behind same.”
