Leicester City attacker Ademola Lookman has attributed the recent run of form of the Foxes to the backing from their fans in helping see out games. The Nigeria international opened the scoring six minutes before the break, adding a fifth Premier League goal to his 2021/22 tally from 20 games and he stated that without the support from the Blue Army especially when the chips are down, it would have been difficult for them to grind out another win. “Especially in the second half, towards the end where they had more possession of the ball, you could hear the fans a lot more getting behind the team,” Lookman told the club’s official website.  “But also throughout the first half as well, in terms of when we were keeping possession as well and we had them pinned back. We heard the fans a lot and that gave us a lot of energy. We can only say thank you.”   Heineken UEFA Trophy Tour begins in Lagos     UEFA CHAMPIONS LEAGUE: Real won’t underrate beaten Chelsea,…     Joshua, Usyk rematch set for major setback   Elsewhere, Rangers Manager, Giovanni Bronckhorst , has disclosed that he was thrilled with Joe Aribo’s eighth Scottish Premier League goal of the season and has tasked the Super Eagles attacker to improve even better in upcoming games.
