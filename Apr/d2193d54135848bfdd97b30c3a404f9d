FIFA’s 14 top managers were reportedly paid just over $19 million (£14.5 million/€17.2 million) in 2021 – equivalent to $1.36 million (£1.04 million/€1.23 million) each on average. The figures, which include pension contributions, are included in the world football body’s 2021 annual report. The aggregate amount is actually slightly down in 2020 when managers’ overall compensation totalled almost $19.4 million (£14.8 million/€17.6 million). That figure covered 15 individuals in total, as well as “separation costs” paid during 2020. The $19 million total for 2021 includes money paid to Gianni Infantino, the FIFA President, Fatma Samoura, secretary-general, two deputy secretaries-general, and 10 divisional chief officers.

Samoura got the same flat-rate allowances, a base gross salary of CHF1.3 million (£1.07 million/$1.4 million/€1.27 million), and a variable gross salary, payable in 2022, of CHF300,000 (£247,000/$324,000/€293,000). In both Infantino and Samoura’s cases, these amounts are the same as for 2020. After two years pegged just below the $200 million (£152.5 million/€181 million) mark, the organisation’s overall personnel expenses pushed well beyond this in 2021, totalling $213.1 million (£162.5 million/€193 million). FIFA attributed the increase to the “strengthening of the Swiss franc against the US dollar”, as well as “higher non-cash post-employment benefit expenses”.
