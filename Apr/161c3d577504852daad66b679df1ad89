Victor Osimhen’s agent Roberto Calenda has denied the Super Eagles striker links with English Premier League (EPL) teams, insisting that the Nigerian is focused on winning Serie A Scudetto with Napoli. The agent told Radio Marte that Coach Luciano Spalletti has helped to improve Osimhen and the Nigerian is ready to repay the coach with more goals. “The boy (Osimhen) is focused, he wants to win and we have all seen his attachment to the team, how he throws himself on every ball. He knows he plays on a strong team. Newspapers rightly need to be filled and written. Even those who do not know football probably, if asked for the names of strikers, would do that of Osimhen. Victor is a Napoli player and now there are seven finals, the important focus is on this season,” Calenda insisted. He, however, lauded Spalletti for his efforts on Osimhen: “Spalletti actually improves the players, he works a lot on the pitch, very attentive to the characteristics of each player.

All are very happy with how things are going. Naples is a targeted choice for its technical growth and as a man. “Our football does not live an idyllic moment but it is always tactical football, there are good coaches like Spalletti. Passing through Italy is an important growth path for any foreigner.” Yet yesterday’s edition of Corriere dello Sport wrote about the interest from EPL teams in Osimhen. “Some English clubs are working behind the scenes: strong temptation for Arsenal but Manchester Utd are also ready to strike,” the paper claimed.“ Last January Newcastle had offered one hundred million: now are no longer enough. De Laurentiis, in fact, in order to sell his jewel, asks for at least 120 million, and in the next matches, Osimhen’s value could rise further. Dreaming of the Scudetto.”
