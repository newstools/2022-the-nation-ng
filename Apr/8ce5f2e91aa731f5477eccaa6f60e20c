Ebonyi State Governor David Umahi has said he endorsed Francis Nwifuru to be governor after him because he enjoyed the backing of stakeholders and traditional rulers of Ebonyi north and central. Nwifuru is speaker of the House of Assembly. A statement by the governor’s media aide, Francis Nwaze, explained further that Nwifuru’s emergence was a popular opinion and outcome of the report of the zoning committee constituted by the governor.

He also maintained the Nwifuru’s endorsement did not foreclose any aspirant from contesting in the election. The statement reads: “…let us emphasise that Nwifuru’s endorsement was borne out of popular opinion, but it has also not disenfranchised anyone from exercising his legitimate rights. “Those interested in contesting for the position of governor in 2023 are not deprived, even as we seek the general cooperation of all to support the decision of the stakeholders, traditional rulers, and the governor on the choice of Nwifuru for a better Ebonyi State.”
