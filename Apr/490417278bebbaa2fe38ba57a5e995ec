Bayern Munich needed a late Robert Lewandowski penalty to squeeze past Augsburg at the Allianz Arena. Following Wednesday’s Champions League defeat by Villarreal, the Bundesliga leaders again failed to convince against a side just seven points above the relegation play-offs. Lewandowski’s 23rd goal in 19 games against them secured the win after Reece Oxford’s handball.

A frustrating first half saw Bayern struggle to find any rhythm against a robust Augsburg defence. Lewandowski was left isolated in attack, while neither Leroy Sane nor Serge Gnabry could make inroads from wide positions. For all of the home side’s possession, Augsburg looked a threat on the counter-attack and went close through Ruben Vargas 10 minutes before half-time. It was much the same story in the second half, Bayern’s play laborious and chances a rarity. Julian Nagelsmann sent on Jamal Musiala, but they still struggled to find their edge.
