President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday signed into law the Executive Order 11, which mandates the government to institutionalise the maintenance of public buildings. The President signed the new law before the commencement of the week’s virtual Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting at the Presidential Villa in Abuja. President Buhari directed all Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) to set up maintenance departments in line with the provisions of the new Executive Order.

The President said the order now gives legal backing to the country’s national maintenance policy, following its earlier approval by the FEC. President Buhari said: “Since the approval of the policy by the FEC, the Federal Government has consciously started the implementation of maintenance of strategic facilities, like the Federal Secretariat in Abuja and Federal secretariats in 24 states of the federation, where at least 40 people are now daily employed in each of those 24 secretariats.”
