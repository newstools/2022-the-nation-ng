Former African Footballer of the Year Victor Ikpeba has tagged the Amaju Pinnick-led Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) a failure for not qualifying Nigeria for the Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup. Ikpeba who is also a member of the NFF Technical Committee admitted that the board has failed Nigeria despite the huge support the federation received from the government. He, however, said that sacking the board was not the solution but the board should see out its tenure.

Pinnick can re-contest if he wants to as the delegates have the right to reject him.” Meanwhile, Ikpeba believed Victor Osimhen has the quality to be the best in the world but the former Lille of France needs to improve his game while playing in the Serie A for Napoli.
