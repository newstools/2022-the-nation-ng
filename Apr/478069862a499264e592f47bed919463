The judge declared that the interference and infringement on the claimants’ rights by barricade and restriction of movement of claimants and residents in and out of the estate by the defendants and their agents was unlawful. He held that the purported estate charge of N35,000 bonus imposed by the second defendant on the claimants was null and void. The judge, however, declined to grant the prayers of the claimants to order the defendants to pay them N100 million as damages. He held that the defendants should bear the cost of the action.
