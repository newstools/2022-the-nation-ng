A social-political group, Osun Shall Rise Again (OSRA) yesterday raised the alarm that some criminals were planning to riot in the state in protest over the killing of 32-year-old businessman, Abiola Afolabi. Afolabi was allegedly killed by policemen but the state police command claimed that Abiola was an armed robber shot in a gun battle. His family and civil society organisations refuted the claim, demanding the removal of Commissioner of Police Olawale Olokode, and a probe into the killing.

Saheed Bakare, chair of OSRA, in a statement, “condemned in total the alleged extra-judicial killing of a promising young man, Afolabi Abiola, by some policemen of the Osun State Command.” But the group also urged the police to “resist any attempt by some discredited politicians and a few mischief makers that want to profit from the sad incident, from hijacking the situation. We do not need any protest now, especially one coordinated by elements of Revolution Now”.
