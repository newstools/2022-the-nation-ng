The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has screened 143 aspirants jostling for the 25-member Adamawa Assembly. The Assembly is occupied by 13 members of the PDP and 12 members of All Progressives Congress (APC). The committee, which conducted the Adamawa PDP House of Assembly/National Assembly screening at the weekend in Yola, said that it screened 54 aspirants for House of Representatives primary and 22 for the senatorial primary of the PDP. Chairman of the Committee, Dave Iorhemba told reporters in Yola that 144 applied for the House of Assembly screening but one did not attend. Dave Iorhemba, a former Benue speaker, who spoke just before leaving Yola after the screening exercise, said: “There were 144 aspirants for House of Assembly seats, but one did not appear for the screening for reason which we don’t know.”   I was just ‘catching cruise’, says lady in…     120 scholars understudy Brazil’s agricultural revolution,…     JAMB directs UTME candidates to start printing notification…   He said the five-member National Assembly, State House of Assembly Aspirants screening took two busy days to complete its job. “We took two days, morning to night. We had much work with the House of Assembly aspirants. They were so many,” he said. He added: “We had a total of 24 aspirants for Senate. Two did not show up for the screening. Those that came were screened successfully.” Hw said his committee was guided by constitutional provisions and requirements of the PDP in screening the aspirants. Explaining, he said: “There are constitutional requirements for people aspiring for elective offices. We look out for such requirements in everyone who came before us. There are important things too that we look for as a party, for instance membership. If you are not a member of our party, there’s no way you can seek our ticket. “You must be a registered member who pay your dues to date.
