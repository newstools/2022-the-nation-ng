Italian football legend Christian Vieri has advocated the partnership of Victor Osimhen and Dries Mertens for Napoli, adding the Coach Luciano Spalletti’s would have avoided weekend’s home loss to Fiorentina with a combination of the two strikers. The former Inter Milan striker with a soft spot for the Nigerian since he moved to Italy from France, believed the duo would have piled pressure on the defense line of their visitors. “Congratulations to Fiorentina who played really well in football,” Vieri reportedly told Bobo TV in a post analysis of Sunday’s match. “I think that if Vlahovic had stayed in Florence, the Viola (Fiorentina) would have risked reaching fourth place in this championship.

I would rather have made Mertens and Osimhen play together from the start. Whoever scores must always play, no matter the form.” Meanwhile, British magazine Four-Four-Two has listed Osimhen as one of the top four players in the Serie along with his Napoli’s teammates, defender Kalidou Koulibaly. In the ranking list released yesterday, Osimhen finishes in fourth place while Juventus’ Dusan Vlahovic is in second place, immediately behind Lazio’s Ciro Immobile. Also present were Theo Hernandez, Milinkovic-Savic, Berardi, Brozovic, Abraham, and Maignan.
