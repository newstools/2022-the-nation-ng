Monarchs in Akure North Local Government Area of Ondo State have faulted the legal advice issued by the State Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Charles Titiloye, on the judgment of a state High Court regarding the prescribed authority of the Deji of Akure, Oba Aladetoyinbo Ogunlade. The monarchs under the aegis of the Council of Obas and Registered Trustees of Olus and Baales in Akure North described the legal advice as a misinterpretation of the judgment delivered in March, 2018. They claimed the judgment in contention never declared the Deji of Akure as the prescribed authority of any community in Akure North Local Government Area of the state.
