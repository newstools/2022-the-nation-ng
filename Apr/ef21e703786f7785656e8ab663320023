Afrobeat singer Femi Kuti has said he was being repeatedly nominated for Grammys without winning. The eldest son of Afrobeat pioneer, Fela Kuti, made this known following his recent loss at the 64th Grammy Awards last Sunday. Femi Kuti’s “Pà Pá Pà” was nominated in the “Best Global Music Performance” and double album with his son, Made, with the song “Legacy” nominated in the “Best Global Music Album” category. His song “Pà Pá Pà” lost in its category to Pakistani singer Arooj Aftab’s “Mohabbat” while “Legacy” lost to Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo’s album “Mother nature”.
