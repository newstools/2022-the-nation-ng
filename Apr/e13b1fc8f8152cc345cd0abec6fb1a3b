Lagos State government has begun training local government officers in registry management among others. The training is being held at the Public Service Staff Development Centre in Magodo, Lagos. Permanent Secretary in the Establishment, Training and Pensions Office, Mrs. Kikelomo Bolarinwa, at the opening yesterday, said: “Registry is a big part of the success of Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), and those who operate these registries have some constraints with the procedures involved because if, for example, files are not readily available, it will impact the efficiency and effectiveness of the various local governments.   ‘Tinubu can handle Nigeria’s complexities‘     Commission reads riot act to workers     Makinde denies unfairness to Muslims   “That is why we are starting this year’s training with registry management because information management is something that ensures continuity of the system. We have chosen officers from across the state for this so they will have the requisite skills that will ensure our records are up to date and revamp our record system. “I expect that after this capacity building session, our registries will be better managed, while misfiling and not obtaining information on time will become a thing of the past.” The Acting Director of the PSSDC, Olufemi Osholaja, noted that registry procedures are the pillars on which public agencies operate. He said: “Record keeping, record management and registry procedures are hallmarks of bureaucracy. The public service is also an enduring institution because it is a bureaucratic organisation that relies more on records, as well as elements of seniority and authority. Most private sectors will collapse but public agencies, such as local and state governments, will not because of the rudimentary procedures of doing things.”
