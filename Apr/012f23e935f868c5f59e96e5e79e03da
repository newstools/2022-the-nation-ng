Workers at the proscribed National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) secretariat at Abattoir, Agege debunked claims that the Chairman of Lagos State Park Management Committee, Alhaji Musiliu Akinsanya (MC Oluomo), has sacked all of them. According to them, none of the 67 workers has been relieved of their duties. The secretariat’s Chief Accountant, Alhaji Omolaja Yisa, at a briefing, described the rumour as “unfounded and aimed at tarnishing the image of our boss, Alhaji Akinsanya.” He cautioned the erstwhile Secretary of the proscribed NURTW in Lagos State Comrade Seyi Bankole, not to heat up the polity by spreading fake news.

Confidential Secretary Mrs Omowunmi Aliu said only two junior workers voluntarily withdrew their services and went with their boss, Bankole. Mrs Aliu said: “Nobody sent them away; they decided to go with Comrade Bankole, who since the crisis started, decided not to come to office. I called them to return to their work but they said they won’t come back until Comrade Bankole returns. “Nobody sacked them. Alhaji Akinsanya even approved payment of their salaries despite staying away from work and I personally paid it into their accounts. They are free to come back.” According to her: “Nothing much has changed except that we’re now working under the Park Management Committee and not the proscribed union.
