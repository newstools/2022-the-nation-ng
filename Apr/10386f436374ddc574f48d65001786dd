Popular skit comedian Debo Adebayo aka Mr Macaroni has alleged threats to his life. He claimed to have been subjected to multiple death threats on social media, citing one he received from a Twitter user a year ago. The alleged threat from a Twitter user identified as Prince Tamiyu Lawal questioned the comedian’s involvement in the Lekki toll gate protests. He stated that Macaroni’s involvement was foolish and unnecessary.
