The Senate yesterday approved N369.04 billion as budget for the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) for the 2022 fiscal year. This was just as it earmarked a N3.019trillion revenue target for the Service in 2022. The budget approval followed the consideration of a report by the Committee on Customs, Excise and Tariffs. The report was laid by the Chairman of the Committee, Senator Francis Alimikhena (Edo North). Alimikhena, in his presentation, said out of the total expenditure of N369.04 billion approved for the NCS in 2022, N108.85 billion is for personnel cost; N45.89 billion for overhead cost; and N214.30 billion for capital cost. Giving a highlight of the NCS budget, he explained that the service in 2022 would implement the E-Customs project to include the automation of Customs agency licenses and Vehicle Identification Number. He stated that the NCS in collaboration with relevant government agencies would pursue improved internally generated revenue by implementing the 2021 Finance Act. Also, the TinCan Island Command of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) generated N135.44 billion in the first quarter of this year. The Customs Area Controller, Comptroller Olakunle Oloyede, made this known at a media conference in Lagos yesterday. According to Oloyede, this is an improvement of N22.74 billion, translating to 20.18 per cent, on the first quarter 2021 collection of N112.69 billion. He said the command’s operations for the first quarter significantly aligned with the statutory responsibilities of the service. Oloyede said this was in revenue generation, trade facilitation and enforcement/anti-smuggling. On export, he said the exported through the command for the period under review was 71,014.4 metric tons with a total Free On Board (FoB) value of N56,205,901,295. He said in the previous year, January-March 2021, the total tonnage of goods exported through the command was 44,502.9 metric tons with a total FoB value of N31,371,825,954. “Comparatively, between January and March 2021 and 2022, the tonnage of goods exported through the Command increased from 44,502.9 metric tons to 71,014 representing an increase of 62.67 per cent.

Oloyede also listed cashew nuts, cocoa beans, rubber, cocoa butter, leather, ginger and frozen shrimps among the commodities. In the area of enforcement and anti-smuggling activities, Oloyede said seized items include 145kg of Colorado (hemp) concealed in two units of Ridgeline trucks and two units of Toyota Corolla vehicles. He also listed 206,000 pieces of machetes, 640 bales of used clothes, 236,500 pieces of used shoes, among others as part of the seized items. Oloyede said that the seized items had a Duty Paid Value amounting to N1,048,810,569. “The import of these products contravenes Sections 46, 478 161 of the Customs & Excise Management Act (CEMA) Cap 45 LFN 2004,” he said. Oloyede said that the command was still facing challenges in the area of treatment of overtime cargo because of the non-implementation of the extant laws guiding uncleared cargo. “Additionally, the lack of government warehouses at close proximity to the port has led to difficulties in logistics and handling cost,” he said. On the 2022 fiscal policy, he said that a 90-day grace period had been given for the implementation of the new duty and excise rates. “The Federal Ministry of Finance has recently published the 2022 Fiscal Policy with an effective date of April 1, however, with the 90-day grace period, it will take effect from June 1. “As much as the Service is putting in the effort to make the necessary adjustments, we are experiencing minor delays in its full implementation because the system is not designed to be retroactive,” he said. He appreciated the support being received from the Comptroller General and the management of the service. Oloyede thanked them for their relentless effort towards strengthening the capacity of the service to perform its statutory responsibilities in line with international best practices. He said that the command was optimistic that the e-customs agenda and deployment of non-intrusive technology, such as scanners, would help them achieve more.
