The National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has approved Lahor Research Laboratories and Medical Centre, a private medical laboratory in Benin City, Edo, for screening and confirmation of COVID-19. Managing Director of the centre Prof. Dennis Agbonlahor hinted this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) yesterday.   ‘Give us equal opportunity in governorship…     Edo announces recruitment into civil service     ‘I’ll revitalise Delta’s moribund industries’   The approval brings the number of private laboratories accredited by NCDC for COVID-19 screening in Edo State to two. Agbonlahor, a renowned professor of Medical Laboratory Science, blamed inadequate number of molecular laboratories for the high cases of COVID-19 recorded in 2020. According to him, Nigeria could only boast two molecular laboratories when the pandemic began to spread across the country. He, however, noted that the laboratories had risen to about 140 due to the private sector investment.
