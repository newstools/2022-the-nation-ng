Former actress Carolina Hutchings has accused popular blogger, Linda Ikeji, of being part of the reasons her marriage crashed. Hutchings, who was married to Musa Danjuma, younger brother to General Theophilus Danjuma, a former Minister of Defence, made the allegation on reality tv show ‘Real housewives of Lagos’. On the show, during a heated argument Hutchings bashed Laura Ikeji, younger sister of the famous blogger, for defending her family. “Linda is part of the reasons why my marriage broke,” Hutchings said.
