The implementation of the Federal Government’s road map policy on cotton, textile and garment ( CTG) is key to the revival of textile sector, National President, National Cotton Association of Nigeria (NACOTAN) Mr. Achimugwu Anibe, has said. He stated this at the stakeholders in textile and cotton value chain seminar and national dialogue on the CTG policy in Nigeria. Achimugwu Anibe noted that the “implementation of the road map policy will not only enable stakeholders to leverage its success, it will enhance relationship among sector’s stakeholders”. The event was coordinated by NACOTAN, in collaboration with  the German Cooperation agency,  Deutsche Zusammennarbett, the European Union ( EU) and the Nigerian Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment. Other key stakeholders are the Cotton Production Merchant Association of Nigeria (COPMAN), Nigeria Textile Manufacturers Association (NTMA) and the Cotton Ginners (GAMAN).     Global, African airlines record major operation recovery     IMF weighs impact of Russia sanctions on global economy     Nigeria eyes $22b global coconut market   Anibe insisted that for industries in the cotton sector value chain to survive, “there there must be insistence on the implementation of policies by government”. The NACOTAN president was optimistic that if provisions contained in the Cotton, Textiles and Garment (CTG) roadmap are implemented, ” the problems that beset CTG sector will be solved”. Speaking at the occasion, Executive Secretary, Cotton Ginners Association of Nigeria Mr . Samuel Oloruntoba, lamented at the  pitiable state of cotton ginner in the cotton value chain. He said there were close to 52 ginneries in Nigeria in the past  but currently the country is left with  about 21. “As a result, there is only 100 tonnes of cotton being ginned per annum instead of the potential of 600 tonnes.  This translates to a loss in both capacity and benefits”, he said
