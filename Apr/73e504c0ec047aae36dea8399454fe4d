Rangers produced a terrific, battling performance to win at Fir Park this afternoon, with Giovanni van Bronckhorst’s men playing for more than an hour with 10 men but still managing to secure an important away result. Celtic will have the chance to return their advantage back to six points when they travel to Ross County on Sunday, but the reigning champions’ hard-fought victory will ratchet up the pressure with next weekend’s Old Firm derby looming.   Fury beats Whyte to retain world boxing heavyweight title     Tottenham held by Brentford to dent top-four hopes     Arsenal beat Man United to boost top-four hopes   The Light Blues went 1-0 up thanks to an own goal from goalkeeper Liam Kelly after 14 minutes, but a red card shown to Leon Balogun turned the game on its head, with the Steelman then equalising with 10 minutes of the first half remaining when Ross Tierney headed home. The visitors were up against it as they sprinted back out for the start of the second half, but a superb goal from Scott Wright two minutes in and a brilliantly taken penalty kick from James Tavernier – his 80th goal for the club – after the hour mark meant there was no way back from Graham Alexander’s players, who were understandably dejected and stunned as they walked back to the tunnel at full time.
