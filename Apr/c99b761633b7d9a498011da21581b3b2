Napoli striker Victor Osimhen says mental strength and a determination to prove the doubters wrong has been key in helping him overcome another challenging season in Italy. The Nigeria international has scored 16 times in 28 appearances in club competitions this season. He has achieved this even though some wrote him off after a serious facial injury in November which ruled him out of this year’s Africa Cup of Nations. The 23-year-old has been forced to wear a protective mask since returning to action in mid-January but it has not affected his form, as he had notched seven goals in his past 10 Serie A outings “From the moment I had my surgery, I read some people saying ‘The season is over for him,” Osimhen told BBC Sport Africa.

Because I know myself and I know the kind of heart that I’ve got. To be able to be back and keep the goals coming is a big thing for me. “I appreciate people that have worked so hard with me to make sure I’m okay even when I had the surgery and everything. “They probably doubted me returning to my best because of the impact the facial incident could’ve had on my mental health.” “I must thank all those who stood by me,” he said. “I appreciate the love.”
