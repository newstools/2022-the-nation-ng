That sounds so funny tho! “In my tradition, we strongly believe that any lady that shoots the shot first can’t really control herself. Although I am a full-grown born again Christians, I can’t still throw my tradition to the trenches. Ugovin, who is also a Nollywood actor, has featured in movies like ‘Challenge me if you can’, ‘When money speaks’ and ‘Virgin priestess’. On combining music and movies, he said: “combining music and movies is quite challenging because most times I will be given a role or called for a job when am recording. This was very challenging when I was recording my EPs.”
