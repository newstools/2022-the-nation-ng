The Chairman, Senate Committee on Industries, Senator Mukhail Adetokunbo Abiru, has requested prayers for the All Progressives Congress, (APC) national leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu on his presidential ambition. Abiru, representing Lagos East Senatorial District, said no other politician among those who had indicated interest in the office of the president has the experience and capacity to manage ‘the complexities of Nigeria and various interests and tendencies in the country’ like Asiwaju Tinubu. He spoke during a Ramadan lecture/Easter held in Ikorodu. Abiru said there is no leader in the history of Nigeria that has made other leaders like Asiwaju Tinubu, urging Nigerians to support his bid for presidency. “We all know the wonders he brought to bear in Lagos when he served between 1999 and 2007, especially in the area of economy, healthcare, infrastructure and human capital development. He will do much more if given the opportunity to lead the country,” he said.
