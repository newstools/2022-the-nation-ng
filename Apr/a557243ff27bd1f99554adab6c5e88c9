The Lagos State Directorate of Public Prosecutions (DPP) has recommended the prosecution of a National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) chieftain, Azeez Lawal (aka Kunle Poly), in connection with an alleged murder case. Lawal, 48, is to be tried at the Lagos State High Court for alleged accessory after the fact to murder. His co-defendant Adekanbi Wahab, 38, will face trial for membership in an unlawful society. A Yaba Chief Magistrate’s Court in Lagos stated this yesterday, explaining that the DPP’s advice showed that a prima facie case had been established against the duo. Chief Magistrate Linda Balogun added that the DPP advised that three other defendants, whose names were mentioned in the advice, though they were charged separately from the two defendants, should be discharged.
