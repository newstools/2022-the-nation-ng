The economy is in dire straits, this is partly so because of the insecurity in the country. “The economy can only grow when there is peace and tranquillity. Therefore, as stakeholders in the Nigerian project, we must pray for peace. Christ overcame the power of darkness, forces of evil and death. This teaches us resilience, patience and determination. We must be ready to do all that is necessary to bring peace to Nigeria.” Ogunlowo also called on the government to do more to tame the growing insecurity in the country, stressing that Nigeria is destined for greatness.
