The Convener, Virtues Life Foundation, Alexander Faranpojo,  has appealed to the Federal Government to mainstream value for human  life into the educational curriculum as a way to further instil value for life among pupils. Faranpojo said this at the launch of the Value for Life Foundation  in Lagos. He stressed the need to include value for life as a subject in schools across all levels. He said: “Nigerian children need to grow up to know that you cannot give or take life that is why you should value it. The child needs to understand that you can’t extinguish life or treat life carelessly from childhood. The child will know that there is value in people not because they are big or tall, but because we are humans. ” We  intend to scale up our value for life in schools as the idea will be laudable enough when the regulatory agencies of education include it as a subject or course of study.

Virtues of Life Foundation Project Manager, Funmilola Faranpojo, said: “Every human life counts. And we are an advocate. We are going to propagate this, say it loud and say it everywhere and promote it.” She  said the group was determined to make it a lifestyle for people to start valuing lives more than before. “There is so much decadence. There’s so much loss of value for human life. People don’t value humans that is  why you see someone coming out to boldly kidnap another human being  and demand ransom, ” she said. She listed some of their activities as including sharing gift items, lectures, training and providing medical help to promote  human life.
