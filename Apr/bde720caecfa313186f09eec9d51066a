Following a recent attack in Bassa Local Government Area of Plateau State which claimed five lives, on Thursday at Laake, in Kwall district, suspected gunmen, believed to be of Fulani extraction have reportedly killed two persons and set ablaze twenty houses in a night attack. The local government, in recent times, have been a target of attacks by gunmen, who engage in massive destruction of farmlands and crops put at N500million. However, the state chapter of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association (MACBAN) has also accused the natives of poisoning their cattle, which they claimed led to the death of 90 cows. The National President, Irigwe Development Association (IDA), Prince Robert Ashi, on Friday disclosed that two people were gunned down by killer herdsmen and twenty houses burnt in a midnight raid by the gunmen suspected to be Fulani herdsmen.

His words: “The people of the village had retired to bed when the gunmen attacked the village at about 9:45 pm. They killed two people, burnt down twenty houses and injured five persons.   It is unfortunate that this kind of attack can take place when security men are trying to halt the orgy of killings in Irigwe land. “Those who carried out this attack are still lurking around, many of them are on top of the hills around us but I don’t know why it is difficult for the security agencies to dislodge them.” He therefore appealed to both the government and security agencies to come to the aid of Irigwe community.
