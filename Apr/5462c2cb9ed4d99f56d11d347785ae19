I love rap, and gospel rap. I also thought about the generation of people who would be listening and how I can carry everyone along especially the young people. I felt Protek would be the best and of course to add some spice to the music.” Going down memory lane, Stellariverz also opened up on how her musical journey began. ”From a tender age I have always been drawn to music, I started in the children choir to the teenage choir and continued as a secular musician in my university days where I was doing backups vocals for numerous artists and covers, until I gave my life to Christ and made a dramatic turn to respond to the higher call of the lord in my life.”
