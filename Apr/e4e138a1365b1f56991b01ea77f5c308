Tottenham came from behind to comfortably beat Newcastle and moved up to fourth in the Premier League. Antonio Conte’s side leap above north London rivals Arsenal on goal difference, but Mikel Arteta’s men have two games in hand including Monday’s trip to Crystal Palace. It didn’t start well for the hosts as Magpies defender Fabian Schar curled in a free-kick on 39 minutes, though Hugo Lloris will be disappointed at not keeping the ball out.

Immediately after the break, Spurs turned it around through Matt Doherty’s diving header from Harry Kane’s cross and they netted their third through Son’s clinical finish. And it got even better on the hour mark when Emerson Royal poked in from close range following excellent build-up play by Doherty – and substitute Steven Bergwijn stroked in late on. Newcastle had no answer and fell to their third consecutive defeat, leaving them 15th in the table but nine points above the relegation zone.
