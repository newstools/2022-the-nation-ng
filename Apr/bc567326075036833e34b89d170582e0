That is why we are protesting. We do not want imposition. They are trying to impose somebody from Kwara State. The person they are trying to impose have been a Special Assistant but we have not seen him here for the past four years. “We want the party leaders to listen to us. We do not want imposition.” An APC woman leader in the area, Ms Omosuyi Kehinde, said the protest was to stop a stranger from representing them in the State Assembly. “We do not want a stranger to represent us. The man we want has been doing empowerment for the people.” But Fabiyi, who denied plotting to be imposed as sole candidate of the party, said he was prepared for the primary. Fabiyi stated that his forefathers had lived in Ajue for many years and he had held several political positions, including winning election as a councillor.
