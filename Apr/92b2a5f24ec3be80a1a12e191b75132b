Actress Ada Karl has called out her colleague, Tonto Dikeh, over an alleged 15-year long debt. In an Instagram post on Wednesday, Karl claimed she invested millions into Dikeh’s career though she wasn’t asking for repayment on that. She noted she was rather after monies accrued from shoes, clothes and gold which Tontolet purchased on credit and for which she has refused to pay. Karl said the items worth were N80,000 as at the time but would be collecting N8million instead because the money has appreciated over the course of 15 years. “Tonto Dikeh, pls pay me my N8m & I take your name off my mouth. Till then, I will keep my mouth where my money is. “Last time, you said I am bitter, yes I am, I want my money. For all my investment into your career, I leave that for God to judge you.

You owe every one of your ex-friends. “Tonto you dey buy diamonds for man but you have no conscience to pay what you owe me since over 15 yrs ago. “I am not even talking about the millions I pumped into your career after I brought you into Nollywood and gave you your first ever movie role & sponsored you with my last sweat till you had your breakthrough & vanished from my life (What a User. ” I should have signed a contract).
