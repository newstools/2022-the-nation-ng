The National Working Committee (NWC) of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) may summon an emergency National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party immediately after the Easter break, it was learnt yesterday. The date for the National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting will be ratified on Tuesday when the NWC resumes its adjourned meeting, which was held on Wednesday at the national secretariat of the party in Abuja. A source in the NWC said last night that the proposed meeting will determine when the NEC meeting will hold.

So, by Tuesday, we shall announce the date for the NEC meeting,” our source disclosed. The emergency NEC meeting will essentially deliberate on the proposed nomination fees, sale of nominations forms and conduct of primaries for aspirants. A timetable purportedly being deliberated upon by the Senator Abdullahi Adamu-led NWC was prepared for the committee by the party’s Directorate of Organisation.
