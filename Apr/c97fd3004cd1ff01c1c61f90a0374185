Lakeside Queens Football Club of Bariga have qualified for the Championship cadre of the Nigeria Women Football League. The Championship cadre is the first cadre of the National Women Football League and the ticket was won after a five-day tussle involving 16 teams in Benin City, Edo State. The Lagos-based team under the tutelage of Coach Tobi Ganiyu was impressive in the ancient city as they won all four matches played in the competition. In their first match, the Lakeside Queens defeated Abruka Queens 2-0, whipped Ijebu United Queens 3-0 in the second match and walloped Celestial Queens 6-0 in the third. Only on Tuesday, despite heavy downpour, Lakeside defeated Kazeem Eletu Queens 1-0 in a match that was concluded in the early hours of Wednesday in Benin.

Coach of the team, Tobilola Ganiyu, said the Benin City feat was a huge moment for the team and a big boost to the progress of the club coming up from the Lakeside Academy. “We fought so well and our hard work has yielded a great result. Winning four games without conceding any is no joke. We will prepare well to do better in the championship next year,” the coach said. Chairman of the team, Lekan Ganiyu, said the feat achieved in Benin was a boost to bring in more sponsors for the team after signing partnership deal with a kits company only last week. Other teams that earned a berth to the Championship cadre of the NWFL are Imo Strikers, Delta Queens and Kazeem Eletu Queens. Imo Strikers won all their four games with Harmony Achiefulu scoring 11 goals for the team while Eletu and Delta won three games and lost one respectively in Benin.
