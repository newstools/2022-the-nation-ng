Pharrel, in a statement, said, “Something In The Water is a Black solution (LOVE) for a systemic issue. And this year we are taking our celebration to a higher platform — the nation’s Capital during Juneteenth Weekend. We want to show the world that there is Something In The Water across the whole DMV and I want to continue to bring awareness to the greatness within these communities and invite large corporations to show up for the people. DC has always been a deep inspiration to me as a person and a musician. “It is the land where Go-Go music was birthed which has provided so much for our people. Our sponsors continue to go the extra mile to show that Something In The Water is so much more than a festival. The goodwill we generate is a defining trait of who we are.”
