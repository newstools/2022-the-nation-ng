Paul Pogba has said that his career with Manchester United is ‘not over’ despite interim manager Ralf Rangnick saying as much following the Frenchman’s calf injury at Anfield. Pogba, 29, went off with an injured calf inside the first 10 minutes of United’s 4-0 evisceration at Anfield during the week. While walking off Pogba was the subject of a smattering of jeers from the away supporters section following the booing he received at Old Trafford against Norwich.

However, the midfielder tweeted during his side’s loss to Arsenal that his time in Manchester was ‘not over.’ He wrote: ‘Absolutely gutted to not be able to help the team in today’s game. I will work even harder to come back stronger and hopefully before the end of the season. ‘It’s not over,’ he added. ‘Thank you all for your support, United we would stand!’
