Manager Brendan Rodgers confirmed in his pre-match press conference that midfielder Wilfred Ndidi will miss the rest of the season with a knee injury. The Nigeria international came off during City’s second leg clash with Rennes in the UEFA Europa Conference League in mid-March and has since had surgery. Rodgers revealed he will not feature again in 2021/22, however, the Foxes will be boosted by the news that centre-back Jonny Evans (hamstring) is nearing a return after featuring for Northern Ireland over the international break.

It’s unfortunate. He’s been a brilliant player for me in my time here. He picked up a nasty injury that he’s had to have surgery on and he’ll recover now until June.” “On the other side, Papy Mendy has come in and done great and been very unfortunate. We thought he was leaving in the summer, he wasn’t in the squad and didn’t play virtually for the first half of the season, apart from international games. “He’s done great for Senegal, he’s come back, but he’s always been a brilliant professional, so we gain a player in him and he’s done very, very well since he’s come back into the squad,” he said.
