The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission EFCC has urged the Rivers State High court in Port Harcourt to dismiss a rights suit by the Chairman of Ibeto Cement, Cletus Ibeto, against it and a businessman, Chief Daniel Chukwudozie. Ibeto is praying the court to prevent the anti-graft agency from investigating allegations of fraud bordering on obtaining N4.8 billion by false pretence, forgery and criminal breach of trust made against him by Dozzy Oil and Gas Limited. He is asking the court to declare that his harassment by the respondents is unlawful. He also wants the court to restrain the EFCC from arresting him and to order the respondents to pay him N500 million damages for his unconstitutional arrest. The EFCC urged the court to dismiss the suit for lacking in merit.   ‘Africa can solve food insecurity through…     Allah hates hurtful speeches, says cleric     ‘NASFAT should deepen youth education’   It said the invitation and interview of the applicant by its officers were lawful because there was a petition against him which alleges the commission of an economic and financial crime. The anti-graft agency urged the court to refuse Ibeto’s prayer for a perpetual injunction to restrain the EFCC. The commission said granting such an order would amount to the court lending itself as a shield against the investigation and possible prosecution of the applicant for alleged criminal infractions. The EFCC claimed that its investigation sufficiently linked the applicant with the commission of the alleged offences. It added that a prima facie case had been made out against him. Justice Boma Diepiri adjourned till April 12 for the hearing.
