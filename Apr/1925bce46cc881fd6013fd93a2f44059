LEGENDARY singer, Evangelist Ebenezer Obey, was a happy and fulfilled man on Tuesday, April 19, following the decision of his band boys and staff to celebrate his 80th birthday in a special way. The General Manager of Obey Music Group, Tunji Odunmbaku, said when the idea to celebrate Obey came up, none of them could dispute it. Odunmbaku is one of the longest-serving staff members of the musician and he has shared some great moments with him. He said: “Today’s programme couldn’t have come at a much better time. It’s indeed a day that God has predestined and we are glad about it. When God dropped this idea in one of us that we must celebrate baba, in our own little way, we all embraced the idea and we started reaching out to people within and without who have at one time or the other worked with baba or come in contact with him.”   Ogunbayo joins the league of 50     Ondo prepares for Asun Carnival     DJ Cuppy unveils future plans   “The response has truly been overwhelming. Baba is indeed a lot of things to so many of us, for the roles he has been playing in our lives. But today is not for a long speech. We shall still have another opportunity soon to itemize most of what we have encountered or come across at the Obey University of Life!” He further described Obey as humble, God-fearing, and a man who cares for people. “His love and caring attributes, his patience in dealing with people generally have gone a long way in remoulding and positively impacting some of us over the years to become who and what we are today. “It’s therefore not out of place if we, in turn, show baba a token of our love, solidarity, support, and best wishes for him on this landmark attainment of the septuagenarian age of 80 on earth.”
