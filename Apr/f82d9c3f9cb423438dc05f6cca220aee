A House of Representatives member from Kano State, Nasiru Ali Ahmad, has shared N150 million cash to 10,000 selected members of his constituency as palliatives for the month of Ramadan. Ahmad said he believed it is better to give cash at a period like this than buy food stuff and supply. “At this critical period of abject poverty amongst Nigerians, I think one should support people with cash to buy what they want, according to their scale of preference, as a way of reducing the economic hardship,” he said. The beneficiaries include: 122 district and village heads, 129 Jumat mosques imams, and over 3000 five times prayers imams with their deputies, party stalwarts and members of NGOs totaling 10,000. Speaking during disbursement at Nasarawa local government secretariat on Sunday, the donor said: “the measure I have taken becomes necessary to douse the effect of poverty amongst members of my constituency.

The money given to some of them would change their criminal minds to what is good. “Nigeria is in a critical economic situation and only quick interventions amongst citizens would douse their disturbing minds from planning evils to becoming patriotic citizens. “It would also serve as a means of fighting restlessness among the youth our community today. And I promise to do more before the expiration of our tenure in office so that at the end local crimes of stealing mobile phones, thuggery and burglary will be curtailed, at least in my constituency.” Kano State Chairman of All Progressives Alliance (APC), Alhaji Abdullahi Abbas, appreciated the lawmaker for his act of giving back to his community. “This gesture will go a long way in helping government address some of the people’s economic challenges,” Abbas said.
