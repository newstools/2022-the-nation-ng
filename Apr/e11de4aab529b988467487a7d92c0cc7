Watford have achieved more nutmegs (play the ball through the legs of an opponent) than any other Premier League team this season, while Emmanuel Dennis is top of the individual nutmeg table. The Hornets may be sat in 19th place in the table, with relegation a distinct possibility, but they have at least shown some skill in their matches, knocking the ball between their opponents’ legs a total of 58 times so far. They have 16 more nutmegs than the side sitting in the second position, Wolverhampton Wanderers, who have completed 41 nutmegs during the current campaign. Manchester United sits in third place, with a total of 34. At the other end of the scale, Burnley have provided the fewest nutmegs this season, with only 11. They are followed closely by Newcastle (15) and Southampton (17).   2023 AFCON: Radebe, Kalou to determine Eagles fate     Calabar agog for Osim memorial kitty     Klopp wary of Chukwueze’s Villarreal ahead of UCL semis   Given those figures, it is perhaps unsurprising that a Watford player sits atop the individual charts, with the club’s top scorer Dennis the division’s most prolific Nutmegger this season, with 20. He is joined in the top 10 by Ismaila Sarr, who has eight, while Juraj Kucka has seven and Joao Pedro six. His closest rivals are Man United’s Jadon Sancho and Leeds United’s Raphina, both of whom have 14. The Hornets have also been able to avoid being on the receiving end of nutmegs as well this season, with only five teams conceding fewer than their total of 25. Arsenal (5), Liverpool (20), Man City (21), Man United (21), and Brighton (22) have been less susceptible, while Wolves, Leicester City, and Crystal Palace have all matched Watford’s number. Leeds meanwhile sit way out on their own at the top of the nutmegs against charts, with 49 conceded.
