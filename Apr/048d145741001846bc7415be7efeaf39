Former Abia State Governor Senator Orji Uzor Kalu has said the two major parties, the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) should cede their presidential ticket to either the Southeast or Northeast in the spirit of fairness and equity. He said the two zones remained the only zones that had not produced the President, adding that those crying for fairness must be conscious of the fact that it would amount to injustice to deny the Southeast the Presidency in 2023. In a statement he signed in Abuja, the former Abia governor said if the Southeast or the Northeast was denied the Presidency in 2023, then the idea of having the six geopolitical zones would have been dead.

He said the Southsouth and Southwest should support the Southeast to take their shot at the highest political office. The statement said: “It is my desire and intention to run for the president. I am committed to this pursuit, but I can’t make an official declaration to this regard without the full support of other regions.  Everywhere in the world, politics is situational and that of Nigeria is exceptionally situational.”
