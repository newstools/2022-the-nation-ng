AN election administration consultant, Alhaji Rafiu Oladotun Odunaye, has advocated the formation of Awori caucus of politicians across political parties as a step towards instituting a culture of politics without bitterness. He also advised against blind following of any political party as it was going to negate the developmental efforts in any Awori Community where this was the practice. Odunaye, who is also the Vice-Chairman of the Political Strategy Committee of Awori Think-Tank (ATT) made the submission in a paper entitled ‘’The Transformation Agenda for Aworis in the politics of Lagos and Ogun State’’.   29 metering school graduates to boost power sector     NALDA targets 2.7m metric tonnes of wheat production     Obasa seeks better funding for health   He made the call at the Virtual Summit of the ATT Political Strategy Committee with the theme Repositioning Awori Nation as a Game Changer in the politics of Lagos and Ogun states held at the weekend. He noted that acrimonious relationship among the people of Awori descent who were in different political parties in the past, was antithetical to the present day political realities, hence, must be jettisoned. He said: “The model of politics without bitterness worthy of emulation was then presented by the Dosumu family of Lagos in the second Republic (1979-83) in which Alhaji Lateef Dosumu was a top-notch of the defunct Unity Part of Nigeria (UPN) and his brother Dr Wahab Dosumu, a member of the defunct National Party of Nigeria (NPN) served as a Minister. Similarly, in Yewa Ogun State, another good example was provided by Akinola family in which Chief Ebun Oyagbola, NPN member, was a Minister of National Planning, the first woman ever, in Nigeria to serve as a Minister, while her blood brother Chief Oyebola Akinola, was Commissioner for Home Affairs in Ogun State under the civilian regime of Chief Olabisi Onabanjo. In 2011, another example was presented by an Ijebu-Ode, Ogun state family in which Mr Olugbenga Ashiru of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) was Minister of External Affairs while his brother Mr Bimbo Ashiru (AC/APC ) was Commissioner for Commerce and Industry under the civilian regime of Senator Ibikunle Amosun.” Odunaye also called for the establishment of Awori Leadership Academy, stressing that by so doing, proper foundation would have been provided for the grooming of the younger generation as a succession plan for future quality political and business leadership in Awori land.
