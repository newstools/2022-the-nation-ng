The President of Nigeria Boxing Board of Control (NBBofC) Rafiu Ladipo and his secretary Remi Aboderin have pledged support to the WBO World Cruiserweight Champion, Lawrence Okolie. The board commended the boxer for identifying with his base, Surulere, and for appreciating and inviting the board to his media briefing while recently hosting him. Ladipo in his remarks said: “This is actually the way to go about the homecoming of a genuine boxer with the interest of promoting himself and the pro boxing trade. He/she should always identify with the Local boxing body.”   Tiger Woods will make ‘game-time decision’ on playing the…     Pitch Awards organizers tip Super Eagles to bounce back     Everton ’ll fight to stay top, says Iwobi   He added that a genuine professional boxer should not wait until he gets into an untoward situation before he identifies or calls on the local sanctioning body of his country, “therefore we appreciate Champion Okolie for doing the right thing.” Ladipo however, said that NBBofC is totally behind Okolie in his quest to win more laurels and make his family and nation proud, saying there are several world titles to be won and the body wishes him well. Speaking further Ladipo said himself and the General Secretary of the Board, Aboderin have been to the 02 Arena in England to watch Lawrence fight twice and they would also be available to watch him whenever the opportunity presents itself.
