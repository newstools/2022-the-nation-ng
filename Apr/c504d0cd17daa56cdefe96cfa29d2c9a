An eyewitness, who spoke with The Nation, said the police were economical with the truth on casualty figure. The source said the hoodlums ran riot in the area without any challenge. Tension has heightened in the state since Thursday last week.

But the national publicity secretary of IPOB, Emma Powerful, said such directives did not come from the organisation.
