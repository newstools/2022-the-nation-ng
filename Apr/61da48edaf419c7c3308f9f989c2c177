Global oil demand is expected to rise by 3.7million barrels per day (mb/d) and to average 1.9 mb/d in 2022. The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) yesterday stated that world oil demand growth is expected to continue recovering and to increase by around 3.7 mb/d to average 100.5 mb/d in 2022. The projection was in a statement issued at the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) Meeting of Ministers and Governors in April 2022. The projection further stimulated global crude oil prices with the Brent Crude rising yesterday to $108.6 per barrel. Strong global demand and prices strengthen Nigeria’s fiscal outlook, supporting the steady implementation of the country’s budget, which largely depends on crude oil. OPEC stated that oil demand in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is anticipated to rise by 1.9 mb/d, with OECD Americas rising steadily, and OECD Europe and the Asia Pacific also recording growth. It recalled that global oil market fundamentals have strengthened since the first quarter of 2021 on the back of sustained global economic and oil demand growth as well as the ongoing efforts by the OPEC and non-OPEC producers participating in the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) to support market stability. OPEC said improvements in vaccination rates and a potential increase in public confidence in managing COVID-19 is anticipated to be more widespread in 2022, further supporting the recovery of oil demand, particularly transportation fuels. The statement noted that petrochemicals and transportation would be sectors of the economy that will require more oil in 2022. Gasoline demand, said OPEC, is forecast to be supported by rising vehicle sales while expansion in the petrochemical industry and steady petrochemical margins will support light distillates in 2022.

It added that the Non-OPEC liquids supply in 2021 is estimated to have grown by 0.6 mb/d from the previous year. Continuing, OPEC said the main drivers for growth were Canada, Russia, the US and China. US production is estimated to have increased by 0.15 mb/d. Estimates show global E & P Capex spending for 2021 rising by a slight 5.1 per cent to average $413 billion, much lower than the $885 billion recorded in 2014. For 2022, the non-OPEC liquids supply is expected to grow by 2.7 mb/d. The main contributors to growth are expected to be the US, Russia, Brazil, Canada, Kazakhstan, Guyana and Norway. Global E&P Capex spending for 2022 is forecast to grow by around 14.9 per cent to average $474 billion. OPEC, however, noted that given the fluidity of ongoing developments, there is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the non-OPEC supply forecast for 2022. According to the statement, OPEC NGLs and non-conventional liquids production in 2021 is estimated to have grown by 0.1 mb/d to average 5.2 mb/d, and is forecast to grow by 0.1 mb/d to average 5.3 mb/d in 2022. It recalled that in March 2022, OPEC crude oil production increased by 57 tb/d month-on-month to average 28.56 mb/d, according to secondary sources. It said total OECD commercial oil stocks fell by 22.8 mb month-on-month in February 2022 to 2,599 mb. OPEC noted that at this level, they were 372 mb lower than the same time one year ago, 334 below the latest five-year average, and 321 mb lower than the (2015-2019) average. OPEC reaffirmed its long-standing commitment to supporting oil market stability for the mutual benefit of consuming and producing nations, as well as the global economy.
