Former Minister of State for Agriculture and Rural Development, Senator Heineken Lokpobiri, and Bayelsa State governorship aspirant under the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Ebegha Tarelayefa, have expressed sadness over the killing of an APC chieftain, Sunday Frank-Oputu. The APC stalwart was on Wednesday morning assassinated by unidentified gunmen at his Bay Bridge residence in Yenagoa, the Bayelsa State capital. The assassins shot him dead through his bedroom window which he allegedly left open to get fresh air because there was no light in the neighbourhood on the fateful day.
