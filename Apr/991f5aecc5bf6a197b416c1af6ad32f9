Giving young designers a chance to be a part of that is a huge opportunity.” Echoing similar sentiment, Da Silva said, “When you think of AMVCA, you think of spotlight, camera, light, and action, so what better way to tell the fashion story? I think it’s an amazing opportunity for young designers to showcase the best of what they have.” In his word, Oke-Lawal said: “Fashion is a huge part of the AMVCAs, and it’s also a huge part of the mark that the AMVCA leaves even beyond the awards show. I think it’s incredible that the AMVCA has seen that and is giving back to the fashion industry that has been an imprint for the show over the years.”
