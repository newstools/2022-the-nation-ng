Osimhen who returned to Napoli on Saturday after Nigeria failed to pick a ticket to Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup was not included in the team that visited Atalanta yesterday. Captain Lorenzo Insigne scored one and set up another to help Napoli win at Atalanta 3-1 and move level with AC Milan at the top of the Serie A table.

Meanwhile, Napoli have confirmed that Osimhen returned to the Campania capital on Saturday, ending the controversy raised recently. As reported by Radio Kiss Kiss Napoli, Osimhen had already agreed to return a little later with Napoli and he went ahead with his plans. He was already ruled out of yesterday’s game against Atalanta due to a yellow-card suspension, so his extended break did not rule him out of contention. The 23-year-old Osimhen, who is contracted to the Partenopei until 2025, has made 25 appearances across all competitions so far this season, for a total of 1773 minutes. In that time, he’s scored 15 goals and provided four assists, being a key attacking figure for Luciano Spalletti.
