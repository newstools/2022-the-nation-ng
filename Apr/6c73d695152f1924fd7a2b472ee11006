This time should feel celebratory because why should you be hiding your pregnancy? “I’m sorry, it’s too much fun to get dressed up and I am not going to let that part disappear because my body is changing,” she said. Since announcing her pregnancy with a series of eye-catching photos, Rihanna has continued to turn heads with her bold maternity style as she hopes the society is able to “redefine what’s considered ‘decent’ for pregnant women”, she further told Vogue. The Fenty beauty mogul, 33, and Rocky, 33, shared the news of her pregnancy during an outing in New York City on January 28, during which Rihanna was photographed in a long pink puffer jacket that was unbuttoned to show off her growing stomach. In addition to unveiling her baby bump, the singer accessorised the look with low-rise light-wash jeans and a long gold cross necklace with colourful gems.
