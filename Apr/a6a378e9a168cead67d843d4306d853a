The Comptroller, Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), Murtala Muhammed Airport (MMA) Command, Lagos, Kemi Nandap, has warned that any officer caught swindling air travellers or attempting to put the name of the service in disrepute would be dealt with. Nandap stated this during the induction of NIS’ new officers. In a statement,  the Public Relations Officer (PRO), MMA, Louisa Amadiokoro, said the training was in line with Comptoller-General’s vision of manpower training. Nandap explained that the objective of the training was to ensure that the officers were equipped for their work, stressing that the Command being the first port of contact for international travellers, requires committed, hardworking and refined officers to represent the image of the country.

If the Command is not satisfied with any of them, such an officer would be sent back for retraining.” The Service headquarters had recently redeployed over 30 officers in MMA Command following the inauguration of the new international terminal at the airport. Some of the officers would be deployed in  the new terminal, which was opened on March 22, 2022 by President Muhammadu Buhari.
