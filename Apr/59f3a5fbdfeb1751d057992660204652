Ekiti Governor and Chairman Nigeria Governor’s Forum (NGF) Dr Kayode Fayemi, has declared he is still consulting on his presidential ambition in 2023. He said the mood in the country requires people of different faiths to be sober and reflect on various challenges confronting the nation. Fayemi,who was in Gombe for private discussion with Governor Inuwa Yahaya, said this is a very spiritual season for Nigerians and journalists should wait till the end of these spiritual exercises to know whether he is contesting or not.

All I will appeal to you as journalists is wait till after the end of this spiritual season. I think it will be disrespectful to all our people to start playing that politics,” he said. When The Nation asked him further if that means he is still consulting with people, Fayemi smiled and looked into the face of his colleague and host, who bursts into laughter with him.
