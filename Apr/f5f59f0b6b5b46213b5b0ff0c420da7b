World number two Daniil Medvedev is a doubt for the French Open after revealing he will have surgery on a hernia. The 26-year-old Russian last week missed the chance to return to the top of the world rankings following a quarter-final defeat by Hubert Hurkacz at the Miami Open. Now he could be sidelined for two months. The French Open starts on May 22.

Thanks for all the support.” Medvedev won last September’s US Open and reached the final of this year’s Australian Open. He was world number one for a three-week spell in February before Novak Djokovic regained the top spot.(dpa/NAN)
