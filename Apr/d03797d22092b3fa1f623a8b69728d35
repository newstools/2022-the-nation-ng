Actress Mary Njoku has reacted to the comment of Pastor Newman following the death of gospel musician, Osinachi Nwachukwu. Therr are unconfirmed reports the gospel singer died as a result of domestic violence. Newman, in a post on social media, insinuated that the late ‘Ekwueme’ singer may have stayed in the abusive marriage following God’s order. He insisted that everyone must have their own cup of suffering. “Away from the criticisms surrounding her death, whether she should have left the marriage or not we don’t know what God told her,” said Pastor Newman.   Actress Yewande Adekoya’s 8-year-marriage troubled     ‘How my mother inspired Veekee James brand’     Nollywood actors, producer harp on well researched scripts…   He continued: “Whether God asked her to remain in the marriage or not will only be revealed in eternity. Someone would say “God cannot say that”, really? Well done Jehovah’s classmate. “Brethren, that was her own cup of suffering for everyone has their own cup of suffering for the sake of Christ.” Reacting to Newman, Njoku noted that nobody deserves to suffer in the name of Christ as she revealed that the late singer won her to Christ. She said: “Na dem be this. Someone should please ask this man what is his own ‘cup of suffering’ for Christ. Where does he receive your portion of beating for Christ (some of us can help him). “Where in the Bible does it say that one must be married to abuse and be beaten to death to serve Christ? “If Christ was a God to pain, suffering and agony, abuse, wickedness, or oppression nobody would serve him. “Pastoral calling is not for everybody, this woman won souls for Christ. So many souls, I am one of them.”
