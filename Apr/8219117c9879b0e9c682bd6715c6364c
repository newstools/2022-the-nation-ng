Kanunta Kanu, brother of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), has reacted to the amnesty offered to the pro-Biafra group by Anambra State Governor Charles Soludo. On Monday, Soludo promised to grant IPOB members and other Biafra agitators amnesty if they lay down their arms. The governor made this known shortly after a prayer session meant to end the controversial sit-at-home order, originally imposed by IPOB.

In a tweet yesterday, Kanu insisted that IPOB was not a criminal group that should be given amnesty. “IPOB led by #MaziNnamdiKanu formed #ESN to defend Biafraland against herdsmen terrorists. Upon the rendition of #MNK, IPOB called for Monday #SitAtHome, which it has ended. IPOB supports Governor Soludo’s efforts to end criminality in the Southeast, but IPOB members are no criminals to be given amnesty,” Kanu wrote.
