Veteran actress Shan George has expressed an ‘unpopular’ opinion about marriage focusing on reasons it would continue to crash. The 52-year-old film maker via an Instagram post argued couples are blinded to the fact that the existence of nagging, quarreling and shouting help them bond better in marriage. George, who had her first marriage at 16 with two other unsuccessful attempts, went on to argue quarreling, nagging and shouting are actually forms of expressing love between couples.
