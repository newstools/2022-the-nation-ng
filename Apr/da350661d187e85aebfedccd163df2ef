Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has signed a contract extension that will see him remain at the club until 2026. Klopp’s deal was set to expire in 2024 with the expectation that he would take a sabbatical but he has committed to a new contract. Klopp’s assistants, Pepijn Lijnders and Peter Krawietz, have also signed extensions through 2026. Klopp told LiverpoolFC.com on Thursday: “There are so many words I could use to describe how I am feeling about this news… delighted, humbled, blessed, privileged and excited would be a start. “There is just so much to love about this place. I knew that before I came here, I got to know it even better after I arrived and now I know it more than ever before.

The feeling we were absolutely right for each other is what brought me here in the first place and it’s why I’ve extended previously. “This one is different because of the length of time we have been together. I had to ask myself the question: Is it right for Liverpool that I stay longer? “Along with my two assistant managers, Pep Lijnders and Pete Krawietz, we came to the conclusion it was a ‘Yes!’ “There is a freshness about us as a club still and this energises me. For as long as I have been here, our owners have been unbelievably committed and energetic about this club and it is clear that right now this applies to our future as much as I’ve ever known.”
