Entrepreneur Academy (EA) of the Mohammed VI Polytechnic University (UM6P) in Benguerir, Morocco has hosted an exhibition of African women entrepreneurs to highlight high female participation rates in the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Themed Dare entrepreneurship!” The event, which was co-organised with the Congolese organisation Affair’DC, focused on sharing experiences of successful women from Morocco and across Africa, aimed at inspiring young people to kick-start their businesses. The Chief Executive, Progekt Consulting and Affair’DC, Gaita Kalemba, said: “Africa is the first continent in terms of feminine entrepreneurship.” The continent is making notable progress in reaching gender parity and promoting women’s employment. Africa has the highest rate of entrepreneurship worldwide and its women are more likely to own a business than men.”   ‘Entrepreneurship is not easy’     Group hosts startups     Firm for 16 African markets   According to the Mastercard Index of Women Entrepreneurs report, published in 2018, Ghana has the highest percentage (46 per cent) of women business owners. The report also highlighted that Africa has the highest rate of female entrepreneurs globally, with 26 per cent of females involved in the entrepreneurial ecosystem. However, there are several persistent challenges that hold many back from launching their projects. Kalemba underlined that finances and securing funding remain the most common challenges faced by women across the continent. Societal perceptions of women are often a source of difficulty too, she argued, adding that some societies still debate whether it is appropriate for women to generate income in their communities. “Many solutions are taking place as well with several institutions across the continent aimed at helping women through training and mentoring programmes to empower them to deliver the most of what they can,” Kalemba noted.
