The Grammy Awards is slated to hold today with a slew of potential historical moments. Here are five nominees, some household names, some newcomers on the cusp of making history.    Kanye will earn a place in history if he surpasses Jay-Z’s 23 Grammy wins, the most for a hip-hop artist. He has 22 Grammys and is nominated for five more, including album of the year for “Donda.”        The group band will make history if their album “Butter” wins in the pop duo/group performance category. They will be the first K-pop act to win a Grammy.   Now Muzik takes over Sound Sultan’s estate     Academy announces presenters as 64th Grammy holds today     ID Cabasa, Naija Ninja complete late Sound Sultan’s 9th…      Rodrigo has been nominated for seven awards for her debut album, “Sour.” At 19, she could become the second-youngest artist to sweep the Grammys’ four major categories: best album, song, record and new artist.  Bennett has five nominations this year for his collaboration with Lady Gaga. He won his first Grammy in 1963, and at 95, he’s the oldest person ever to release an album of new material.  Jon Batiste leads all artists this year with 11 nominations across different genres. If he takes home at least nine awards on Sunday he will bypass Michael Jackson and Santana as the artists who have won the most Grammys in one year.
