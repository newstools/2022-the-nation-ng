There are several self-exclusion schemes available for players looking to take some time off gambling products. Virtually all online and offline casinos have a self-exclusion program you can use to cool off. Some regulations also enforce mandatory self-exclusion participation upon gambling operators. One great example is the UK Gambling Commission, which requires all operators licensed in the UK to participate in GamStop self-exclusion and usually, players are looking for some ways to cancel GamStop scheme during their exclusion period. Other mandatory schemes include SENSE (for UK land-based casinos), SpelPaus (for casinos licensed in Sweden), and ROFUS (for Danish online casinos). MOSES is another option that’s gaining popularity among players in the UK. Here’s an overview of the self-exclusion scheme, including how it works and how to register. MOSES is an acronym for Multi-Operator Self Exclusion Scheme, designed for UK punters who want to take time off gambling. Like SENSE, MOSES is intended for offline (land-based) gambling shops and locations. However, operators aren’t obliged to participate in the scheme. Instead, players voluntarily sign-up to be excluded from betting shops they visit often. You can register on MOSES to take a break from gambling products offered by multiple operators in your local area, including casinos close to your residence or place of work. MOSES is customized to your needs and is perfect when you need to avoid specific local casinos. Players can also add other operators to the list of destinations they want to self-exclude from visiting. Once registered on MOSES, you’ll be blocked from the identified casinos for a fixed term of 12 months, after which you can extend the self-exclusion for another year or regain gambling access. The scheme is also voluntary and available for all land-based casino players in the UK. MOSES uses a straightforward framework that allows players to quickly self-exclude from multiple betting shops instantly and simultaneously.

Once you are registered on the scheme, you won’t have access to local betting shops for at least 12 months. You can also add new shops to the list of blocked operators. The scheme is voluntary and allows players to customize their self-exclusion by choosing the destinations they want to avoid. It is similar to GamStop program which many players need, but it is less regulated and operators do not share their databases with each other. However, MOSES also comes with various drawbacks. Unlike GamStop, SENSE, SpelPaus and ROFUS, the scheme isn’t a mandatory requirement. This implies casinos aren’t obliged to participate in MOSES. Players can also bet on land-based casinos in other towns, as well as online. What’s more, the scheme only works for UK land-based casinos. Players have many ways around MOSES. Nonetheless, it is a perfect way to stay away from casinos near your residence, workplace, and other destinations you frequent. MOSES works best to complement other programs, such as SENSE (Self Enrollment National Self Exclusion), GamStop, SpelPaus ROFUS, and game blockers like Gamban and NetNanny, Betfilter, and Gamblock. The Multi-Operator Self Exclusion Scheme offers players a chance to customize their self-exclusion, unlike other schemes. GamStop blocks you from all UK online gambling sites, while SpelPaus and ROFUS block you from Swedish and Danish websites. On the other hand, SENSE excludes you from UK land-based casinos, and app-based game blockers can bar access to all forms of online gambling. MOSES works differently, allowing you to select the betting shops you want to avoid, appealing to different players. There are many different gambling-related laws in the UK and if you are interested in politics you probably need to learn about them and know the reasons why these rules were applied. It is perfect when you need to resist gambling on local casinos and other land-based betting destinations close to where you are. The license also lasts for 12 months, within which you won’t have access to the specified casinos, and you can add more operators to the library.
