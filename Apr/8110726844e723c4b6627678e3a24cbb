AFTER 28 years of unfulfilled promise, the Buhari-led administration has handed over the Certificate of Occupancy (C of O) of promised Government allocated three-bedroom unit houses to team members of the Super Eagles who won the 1994 African Nation’s Cup. The Federal Government explained that the houses have been allocated to the team members across states of their interest since it could not accommodate the entire team in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). It further disclosed that the houses are being provided for the team members who were not among the earlier nine members who got theirs earlier in March this year. The houses are being handed over to the team members who could not meet up with the handover ceremony in Delta and the Imo States respectively, due to a logistics gap.

The name of Finidi George was mistakenly left out, but the Ministry stated that it has been sent to the President for approval. Speaking on behalf of the recipients, the former coach of the Super Eagles, Austin Eguavoen, said: “I am delighted that this has finally happened. It has been 28 years, and many administrations have come and not succeeded in fulfilling the promise. This administration has done extremely well in fulfilling this promise. “On behalf of my colleagues, we are very grateful from the bottom of our hearts because there is a stanza in our National Anthem that says – ‘the labor of our heroes past shall never be in vain.’ We thought this was going to go in vain, but this present administration made sure the labour of our heroes past did not go in vain.”
