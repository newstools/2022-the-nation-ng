Paul Pogba is “unlikely” to play for Manchester United again this season, says interim manager Ralf Rangnick. The France midfielder, 29, is out of contract this summer and came off 10 minutes into Tuesday’s 4-0 defeat by Liverpool with a calf injury. Pogba is set to be out “four weeks minimum”, with United’s last game of the season at Crystal Palace on 22 May. “It is very unlikely he will play again until the end of the season,” said Rangnick.

In his second spell with the club, the 2018 World Cup winner has scored 39 goals in 226 appearances, helping them win the League Cup and Europa League in 2017.
