Mali are set to choose between Eric Chelle, Gernot Rohr or Winfried Schafer as their new senior national team coach. The Malian football federation (FEMAFOOT) dismissed head coach Mohamed Magassouba on April 1, and opened up applications for the leadership role of the Eagles. According to Afrik Foot, no less than 57 candidates submitted their credentials. The federation has reportedly narrowed the search down to a final list of three: former Malian international Eric Chelle, the Franco-German Gernot Rohr and the German Winfried Schafer. This is according to journalist Drissa Niono.

He has a reputation as an exciting young coach, though a lack of experience at international level could count against him. Rohr, 68, is a strong candidate with immense experience at both club and international levels. He is best known for his time with Nigeria’s Super Eagles from 2016 to 2021, leading them to qualification for the 2018 World Cup, as well as a third-place finish at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations. He has also managed the national teams of Gabon, Niger and Burkina Faso. Schafer, 72, is the surprise package of the trio. The German led Cameroon to AFCON glory 20 years ago, but has not managed in African football since 2004. FEMAFOOT will conduct final interviews in the coming days before naming their choice approximately a month before the start of qualifiers for the 2023 AFCON. Mali have been drawn in Group G of the qualifiers, alongside Congo, Gambia and South Sudan.
