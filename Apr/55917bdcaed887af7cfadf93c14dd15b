The member representing Oshodi/Isolo Constituency in the Lagos State House of Assembly, Jude Idimogu, has said his business in the house is to ensure the well-being of his constituents. He spoke with reporters in his office in Lagos while presenting what could be regarded as his scorecard in the assembly. Idimogu said one of the features of quality representation of one’s constituents was the ability to attract the benefits of democracy through empowerment programmes.

He said besides the empowerment and scholarship projects, the masses were more interested in “stomach infrastructure,” which, according to him, had made the name “Idimogu” a brand in his immediate locality. Idimogu said other achievements in the past four years in the ninth Assembly included job placement, sponsoring of bills that were passed into laws, road infrastructure, renovation of primary and secondary schools and upgrading of health facilities in the communities. Other achievements included transformer installations and talent hunts for youths. Although the lawmaker said the projects were not for record purposes, he noted that there were more undocumented achievements than those recorded. Assuring his constituents of continued quality representation ahead of the 2023 general election, Idimogu said he was committed to enhancing the welfare of his constituents by giving them the dividends of democracy.
