A socio-cultural group, the Yoruba Ronu, has said that the current political realities in the ruling All Progressives Congress(APC) do not favour emergence of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo as the party’s candidate. It said Osinbajo’s declaration for the Presidency has caused what it termed political mudslinging and public opprobrium. The group said it was worried that the regeneration of misinformation and disinformation might erode public trust in the capacity of the Yorubas to present Nigeria’s next President. Chairman of the Yoruba Ronu Group, Prince Diran Iyantan, in a statement issued in Akure, said the public discourse would turned the presidential declaration of Osinbajo into a controversy.

Iyantan called for urgent intervention of all Yoruba sons and daughters to intervene “and not allow this political imbroglio between our two sons to escalate further into deep rotted crisis as it is gaining traction on daily basis.” He said:”Everyone should be circumspect of the wish of the soothsayers and prophets of doom’s prediction that the event of sixty years ago, which monikered us as the “Wild Wild West” will not repeat itself. “Vice President Yemi Osibanjo is very competent and experienced to lead Nigeria, but the present issue surrounding the Vice President Yemi Osibajo’s declaration to run as president does not just favour his ambition right now, unlike his political mentor, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu whose ambition to govern Nigeria had been well known for a longtime, and the reason we, at the Yoruba Ronu Group, throws our support to him, immediately, he declared to run as Nigeria’s next President.”
