Speaking at the event, MI Abaga pointed out that Nigeria is the (vesicovaginal fistula) VVF capital of the world. In his words, “It means that about 800,000 young women before the age of 15 generally have been married off to someone and are in a hospital somewhere. The challenges are urgent and life and death. We all must remember who we were – as young people who dared to challenge situations and authority and do the needful in calling for the basics in health, education, security to ensure meaningful change.” The #BreakTheBias: Brainstorm & Brunch also doubles as Hive’s official onboarding event, where its 2022 gender equality strategy and the 2022 flagship campaigns of its advocacy partners were announced.
