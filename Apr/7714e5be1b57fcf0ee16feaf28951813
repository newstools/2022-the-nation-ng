Onetime On-Air Personality at Naija FM, Ife Salako aka Ifektive has announced his intention to vie for a seat at the House of Representatives under the Alimosho Constituency in the coming general elections. The young broadcaster says his resolve to go into politics is for the growth and development of Nigeria and her people. Salako made it known that to effect change in the government, one has to partake in it. On what prompted his decision, he said, “In problem-solving, there is a root cause of each problem and the best way to solve the problem is to go to the root of that problem and solve it from there.

So, not only has the Constituency not been governed, it has been abandoned. “I have lived in Alimosho Constituency all my adult life and there has been little to no development in this constituency for over 30 years. Alimosho lacks infrastructure, security, job opportunities, educational growth, industrial development, and many more.” Ifektive, who had worked as a radio presenter for 11 years, resigned in 2021 to face new challenges which according to him include getting involved in politics.
