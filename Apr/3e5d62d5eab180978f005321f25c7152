Napoli attacker, Victor Osimhen is catching the eye at the Emirates and is believed to be flattered by the interest from London. Osimhen who has been a subject of interest across Europe is believed to have seen Arsenal make initial contacts with his representatives about his availability. A move is however not imminent as Napoli look to keep the attacker for at least one more season while the former Lille man doesn’t see Arsenal as the perfect destination at the moment. Napoli transfer guru, Emmanuel Cammaroto believes Osimhen wants to play in the UEFA Champions League with Napoli and may not be making a move at the moment.

At the moment, Arsenal has come forward and has sounded out the player’s entourage. Osimhen has registered the interest of the Gunners, and it seems that he has been flattered by the proposal. But he doesn’t consider Arsenal a first choice for his career. “The former Lille striker wants to play in the Champions League with Napoli, and then he will choose his future.” Meanwhile, despite some spirited efforts, Osimhen failed to see the back of the net last night as Napoli drew 1-1 at home against Jose Mourinho’s Roma in a crucial Serie A encounter at the Maradona Stadium in Naples. Lorenzo Insigne scored the opener for Napoli in the 10th minute but Roma grabbed the equalizer almost at the dot of time in the 90th minute.
