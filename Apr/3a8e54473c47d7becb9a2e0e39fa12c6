The organisers of the maiden MASA Isonyin Marathon (MIM) billed to for  Saturday, 16th April  have promised to expand the race  following the response that greeted the extension of the registration deadline for the historic event. Media Director and Event Manager, Adesola Salami, said they are ready to welcome the best runners across the country as everything is in place to ensure a hitch-free event. She also confirmed the extension of the registration deadline just as plans have been mapped out to accommodate over 1,000 runners for the first of its kind 21km race in the Ijebu-North East area of Ogun State. She added that the increased interest by the local runners and others outside of Ogun State prompted the extension of the registration deadline.
