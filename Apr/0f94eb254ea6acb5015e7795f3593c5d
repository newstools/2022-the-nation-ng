Nigerian equities continued to witness significant selloffs as investors ignored dividend payouts and sought to monetise capital gains and lock in value in less volatile securities. Benchmark indices for the Nigerian stock market closed weekend with average decline of 0.45 per cent, equivalent to net capital depreciation of N114 billion. Two major companies-Lafarge Africa and MTN Communications Nigeria closed their dividend-paying register while some six companies announced new dividend payouts during the week. Most sectoral indices also closed on the downside, underlining the prevalent negative sentiments at the market. The All Share Index (ASI)- the common value-based index that tracks all share prices at the Nigerian Exchange (NGX), closed weekend at 46,631.46 points as against its week’s opening index of 46,842.86 points. This depressed the average year-to-date return for Nigerian equities to 9.17 per cent. Aggregate market value of all quoted equities dropped from its week’s opening value of N25.253 trillion to close weekend at N25.139 trillion, representing a loss of N114 billion. Expectedly, most sectoral indices also closed lower with the NGX 30 Index, which tracks the 30 largest companies at the Exchange, dropping by 0.43 per cent. The NGX Industrial Goods Index declined by 0.42 per cent. The NGX Consumer Goods Index dropped by 0.35 per cent while the NGX Insurance Index dipped by 0.21 per cent. Analysts at Cordros Securities said the 2021 full-year earnings season appeared to have run its course, and investors’ sentiment will now be influenced by developments in the macroeconomic landscape and the movement of yields in the fixed income space. Analysts advised investors to take positions in only fundamentally sound stocks as the weak macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.
