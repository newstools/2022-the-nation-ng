The South West Agenda for Asiwaju 2023 (SWAGA’23) yesterday mourned the passage of the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi III, who joined his ancestors at the age of 83. In a statement by its national chairman, Senator Dayo Adeyeye, and National Secretary, ‘Bosun Oladele, SWAGA’23 described the late monarch as an encyclopedia of Yoruba history and rallying-point for the advancement of the Yoruba race and unity of the nation. The statement reads: “The entire membership of SWAGA’23 under the leadership of Senator Dayo Adeyeye will sorely miss the departed icon and legendary traditional ruler of Oyo Kingdom, His Imperial Majesty Iku Babayeye, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi III, the 45th Alaafin of Oyo, whose transition was announced on Saturday April 22, 2022.

We shall continue to hold on to his admonition that ‘our hands are on the plough, we must not look back’.”
