A governorship aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ogun state, Otunba Jimi Adebisi Lawal (JAL), has condemned the renewed fight between rival cult groups in the state. The supremacy battle between the rival cult groups was said to have resulted in the death of about 15 people – eight in Sagamu and seven in Abeokuta – in the last one week. Lawal said in a statement: “The increase in the spate of crime and violence in our dear Ogun state is becoming alarming and unacceptable. We can no longer gloss over it or pretend that all is well.

That way, the security measures would be proactive instead of being reactive.” The governorship hopeful empathised with the bereaved and prayed the Almighty God to comfort them even as he urged the Police to urgently nip the situation in the bud and ensure that the course of justice is served.
