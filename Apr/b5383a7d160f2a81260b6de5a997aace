I wrote some of the tracks on the EP when the pandemic was chronic and severe. During the stay-at-home period and midnight curfew, there was absolutely nothing to do so I started writing songs and then I called some of the featured artists on the EP to drop their verses.” Continuing, the singer said, “The decision for the title ‘Love & Afrobeat’ was a result of the pains in the world at the time, and I wanted to use my EP to preach and drive love into the heart of those who had experienced pains and to let them know that my sounds can take away that pain and they are not alone in this pandemic. The EP was just a way for me to reach out to the world and heal it from the pains the pandemic had caused in my quota.” Speaking on the latest five-track EP which features Blaq Jerzee, Singah, and Jaywillz; JT noted that his choice of features was musicians more like family to him.
