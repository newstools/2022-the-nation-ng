Muslim nations must unite and support one another. If we are not united, we cannot lead the world. Leaders should safeguard the interest of the weak in the society while Islamic organisations should stop internal wrangling,” Bello said.

Alhaji Bolarinwa said the lectures were meant to address challenges in the society. “The lecture is also meant to prepare Muslims towards having a perfect and acceptable fasting experience during Ramadan in line with the dictates of the Qur’an and Sunnah,” he said.
