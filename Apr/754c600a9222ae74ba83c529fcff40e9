An Islamic scholar, Ustadh Abdulhakeem Muhammad Awwal has attributed the love for money and worldly materials to the increasing moral decadence in the country. He also said absence of quality education led youths into drugs, ritual killings and other forms of vices. Ustadh Awwal spoke during the 5th Ramadan Lecture organised by Prince Tajudeen Olusi Foundation. He lamented that some parents now encourage their children to go after sudden wealth neglecting the consequences. Chairperson of Iru-Victoria Island LCDA, Rasheedat Adu urged Muslims to continue to live with the teachings of the Holy month of Ramadan. She urged parents to rededicate their time towards instilling morals and values in their wards so as to contribute their quota to the society.

If we can do that during the month of Ramadan, I think we should be able to do that after Ramadan,” she said. Chairman, Lagos State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) said Ramadan is a wake-up call on Muslims to demonstrate leadership by example in the overall good of the nation. He said the yearly Ramadan Lecture was designed to address and recommend viable solutions to various challenges facing the society. Former member of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Oladele Adekanye, hailed the foundation members for sustaining the programme in the five years. “We are very much aware of the degeneration that has set-in in regards to bringing children up worldwide and it is very saddening and disheartening,” he said. Adekanye, an aspirant for the House Representatives, said the economic situation in the country should not be an excuse for parent to neglect their responsibility
