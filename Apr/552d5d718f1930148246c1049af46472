Continuing, Zaaki narrated the sacrifices he had to make to complete the degree course. “It wasn’t easy at all combining school and my music career,  a lot of sacrifices were made, my family, my music career, TV program all suffered a stroke lot of setback in the pursuit of my degree but  now that  I have graduated I will make up for all of it before I start my PHD.”
