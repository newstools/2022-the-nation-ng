Around two dozen fans gathered outside Carrington to protest against the Glazer family, who own the club. Another protest is expected at Old Trafford on Saturday before United’s Premier League match against Norwich.

United have won only three of their past 12 matches in all competitions – losing 1-0 at Everton last Saturday – and are guaranteed to fall short of last season’s final tally of 74 points. “We know that football is a game of passion and emotion,” interim manager Rangnick said. “I think we can all understand our supporters are disappointed both with where we stand in the table and with the performance which we showed against Everton. “But I believe our supporters are one of if not the best in England and as long as they protest in a peaceful way and as long as they still support the team in the stadium I think they have the right to express their opinion. I can understand they have been disappointed.”
