On Saturday, Inspector-General Alkali Usman led a team of senior police chiefs to patrol of the expressway. A villager, Shehu Bala, who confirmed the incident to reporters, said the residents were taken away at about 11pm on Sunday. He said the bandits, who came in large numbers, invaded some houses and went away with 22 residents, including five women. “The bandits came in their large numbers as some of them wore army uniforms. They moved from house to house and woke their victims up before they marched them into the bush at gunpoint,” he said.
