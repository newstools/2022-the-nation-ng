The National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) at the weekend intensified efforts to ensure that more Nigerians and residents are captured in its database as government enforces  the policy of barring outgoing calls of citizens who have not linked their Subscribers Identity Modules (SIM) with their National Identity Numbers (NIN). NIMC through the Head of Corporate Communications,  Mr Kayode Adegoke, said over 78 million unique NINs have been issued in the past two years since the Federal Government started the policy. Adegoke, however, expressed gladness that more Nigerians and residents have been enrolled within a week of policy enforcement across the country.
