Asiwaju Musulumi of Yorubaland, Alhaji Khamis Olatunde Badmus has bemoaned the lack of Federal Government presence in Osogboland, Osun State in the areas of capital projects and establishment of federal institutions. Badmus made this known in Abuja at the National Assembly during the 2-day public hearing by the Senate Committee on Health on the proposed bill for the establishment of the Federal Medical Center. The elder statesman in his contribution at the hearing lamented that despite the fact that Osogbo is the state capital of Osun, unlike its counterparts all over the country, the ancient city has not been fortunate to have a Federal government establishment located in the town.

He, therefore, called on the 9th Senate who he described as the best that has ever happened to this country to see the establishment of the Federal Medical Center, Osogbo as their legacy and pass the bill into law. “By so doing; the 9th Senate in particular and President Buhari-led government would have bequeathed to Osogbo a lasting legacy that the town will never forget, “Badmus added. The bill for the Establishment of a Federal Medical Center located in Osogbo is sponsored by an Osogbo-born Senator Ajibola Basiru who is representing Osun Central at the National Assembly. Among the notable dignitaries of Osogbo extractions at the hearing were the Ataoja of Osogboland, Oba Jimoh Olanipekun; Justice Kunle Adeigbe,(rtd) Mr. Kunle Adegoke(SAN), Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Isiaka Oladayo Amao, who sent someone to represent him, political leaders and students’ leaders of Osogbo extraction.
