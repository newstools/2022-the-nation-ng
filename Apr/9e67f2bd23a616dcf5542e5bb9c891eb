Award-winning actress, Dakore Egbuson-Akande has weighed in on the challenges of the Nigerian film industry saying the multi-million Dollar sector suffers from lack of structure. Speaking on the support of the Nigerian government towards Nollywood practitioners, Dakore said, “The Nigerian government has not supported Nollywood enough, I am sure they tried but they’ve not just quite found the formula yet. For me, as a practitioner, I know that we suffer from a lack of structure so that’s really what we need. That is the first thing, structure in terms of residual income for actors, welfare for us, you know making sure that we have proper health care and all of those things because we really are projecting Nigeria to the world so we really should be supported in that way.”   StarTimes surprises Femi Adebayo with private screening of…     Asa: I don’t want to be a stranger in Nigeria     Omawumi, others pick six winners as Quickteller Barz and…   The Castle & Castle actress also opened up on what she had been up to lately.
