TALENTED singer, Alabo Tuonims aka Ninety has revealed some of the challenges he faces as a rising star in the ever-booming Nigerian music industry.   It’s my turn to shutdown 02 Arena – Uzo     Kemi Oyedeji speaks on new book, ushering     I’m happy to be back after 10 years, says Shan George   Sharing some of the challenges in a chat with The Nation, the Rivers State indigene who is gearing up for the release of his debut Extended Play(EP) titled ‘Rare Gem’ on April 28, said “Standing out in saturated music industry like ours is a challenge in itself. Everyone is doing a lot of the same thing and there are new sounds and voices coming out every day. If you don’t do something to set yourself apart, your voice can be easily lost here. And then of course you have to deal with the usual self-doubt and fear. You begin to question yourself and whether you can make it, and it can be very draining. At the moment though, the most challenging thing for me is learning how to do certain things on the spot. Being an artist isn’t just about the music, there’s so much more that goes into it and a lot of these things are new to me, so I find myself having to figure them out as I go along”. Describing how he has managed to deal with the challenges, the young musician said, “I just remind myself of my goals and focus on working towards them one step at a time. Once I remind myself that I’m here for a reason and that I want to succeed and make my family proud, especially my father, it becomes easier to face my obstacles head-on and see them not as problems, but as opportunities to learn, improve and get better. When I’m faced with fear and self-doubt I tell myself that it’s just my mind playing tricks on me. I believe wholeheartedly in myself and my craft and that makes it easier to silence the noise and doubt in my head.”
