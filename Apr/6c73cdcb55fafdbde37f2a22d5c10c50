Many African countries are pressured by high inflation rates, causing everything to become expensive. Inflation is measured by the rate at which prices of goods and services increase within a given timeframe. One trend that is common among African countries with high inflation rates is that they are mostly import-dependent. When a country imports more than it exports, it inevitably becomes susceptible to various economic challenges, including weak exchange rates and high inflation rate which, in turn, makes everything expensive. Some renowned economists told Bloomberg that the biggest danger to the global economy in 2022 is not the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, it would be high inflation. But should this be a surprise? After all, inflation has always been a major problem in Africa. According to Reuters, Sudan’s Central Bureau of Statistics reported the country’s inflation at 258.40% in February 2022.
