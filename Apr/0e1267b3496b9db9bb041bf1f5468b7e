Twenty-two-year-old GUS Season 12 winner, Odudu Ime Otu, has explained his reasons for supporting widows during his recent trip to Akwa Ibom. During the trip, Otu paid a visit to The Widow Of Zarephath Foundation to render his support. Raised by a single mother, Otu said being raised by a single mother gave him a firsthand experience of the struggles of single or widowed women who lack the support of their spouses in raising their children, hence the reason for alleviating some of the widows’ economic struggles.
