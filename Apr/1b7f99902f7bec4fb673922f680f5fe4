The management of Kwara State University (KWASU), Malete has intensified efforts to partner Royal FM Ilorin, to train students in broadcasting. This was made known when founder of the radio station Gbenga Adebayo visited the Vice Chancellor of KWASU, Prof. Mustapha Akanbi. The VC  noted that with the National Universities Commission (NUC) ranking  of KWASU as the fastest-growing state- owned university in the country, the institution is a fertile ground for investors seeking huge  returns on their investments. The VC said  the university  was open to  investors and private individuals who are willing to support and add value to the university through funding projects, providing endowments and grants.
