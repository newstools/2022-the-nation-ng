Popular On Air Personality (OAP) Daddy Freeze has responded to former BBNaija star, Ka3na Jones after her post blamed the devil for destruction of marriages. Ka3na in January announced she was officially divorced from her foreigner husband, Jones. In a recent post, she blamed the devil for failed marriages while reacting to news of Nkechi Blessing’s marriage crash to her ex, Opeyemi Falegan The reality TV star wrote: “How about we all stay unmarried and simply love ourselves?

The social media commentator argued the devil was never reported to have destroyed any marriage in the Bible. The bi-racial ‘scripture teacher’ maintained people’s shortcomings were responsible for marital woes but ever the devil. “Dear K3na and Nigerians Christians. The devil does not destroy marriages; the devil did not destroy a single marriage in the entire Bible, read for yourself to verify. So please, stop blaming the devil for our personal errors and shortcoming,” he wrote.
