Lagos State has given insurance death benefits to dependants of its deceased workers. About 277 cheques were presented to beneficiaries, the highest figure being N10.3 million and the lowest N500,000. Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance Sewanu Hundogan said the presentation was in accordance with the pension law, which ‘mandates the insurance of workers and a demonstration of the love and commitment of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to the welfare of workers.’ Hundogan noted that the state attaches importance to welfare packages for its workers, and this informed the arrangement with Group Life, Group Personal Accident, Motor Property, Liability and Marine. “Death is inevitable, but for those who died in active service, their dependants should not be left to suffer or be depressed. That is why this insurance scheme is part of the general welfare package for workers.

We are doing this so that people can have more understanding of what obtains therein. “Two hundred twenty seven cheques were presented here today, the highest figure is N10.3 million and the lowest is N500,000, depending on years of service. “We usually pay premium to the insurance company because we want to ensure that when the inevitable happens, the dependants won’t suffer; and this administration has not defaulted since it started on that path.” A beneficiary, Olabode Jonathan, thanked the government for remembering them and promised that the fund will be put to judicious use. “I didn’t know something like this existed within the ministry. But out of compassion, my colleagues in other departments enlightened me and told me how to go about it, they were so helpful. I say thank you and God bless you.”
