Super Eagles winger  Samuel Chukwueze  has yet received plaudits  after he came off the bench  to score  Villarreal’s historic equaliser against Bayern Munich  in Tuesday’s UEFA   Champions League tie at the Allianz Arena . Chukwueze  was barely four minutes  as a second half substitute for ‘Dutch-Nigerian’ Arnaut Danjuma in the 84th minute before smashing home the  equaliser  in the 88th minute  to  cancel   Robert Lewandoski’s 52nd  lead  for Bayern . The result gave Villarreal  a 2-1 aggregate following their first leg’s  1-0 home win as they qualified  for their first  UCL semi-final in 16 years. Chukwueze’s goal  would then be described as ‘tremendous’  by editors of Villarreal’s website who noted  inter alia  in their reportage: “In the 82nd minute, Danjuma could have scored the equaliser with a low effort after Gerard Moreno sent him through. The Submarine were getting close to a goal. “In the 88th minute, Samu Chukwueze made the dream come true with a great Villarreal CF goal. A fantastic counter-attack started by Dani Parejo, driven forward by Gio Lo Celso and Gerard and finished perfectly by the Nigerian striker, who didn’t falter against Manuel Neuer. Tremendous.”   Mali shortlist  Rohr for Eagles coaching job     Paris 2024: Amusan, Quadri, six others  get IOC scholarship     2022 Commonwealth Games: Sports Ministry names  Alli Team…   Yet coach Unai Emery  has  equally underlined the  solidity  of his side which eventually culminated  into Chukwueze’s heroic goal. “It was a perfect match in defence,” the 50-year-old  former Arsenal coach  said  after the game.“ It’s the only way against teams like this with great attacking capability. “We were going to get our chances because we have players who give their all.” He added :“I’m happy for him (Chukwueze) and everyone.
