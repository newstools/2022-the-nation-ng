In the statement which reads in part, the management said, “In our industry, we have the best record and capacity to move passengers on, and get them to their destinations safely, in the event of a break-down, in the course of a journey,” noting that its longevity so far, and appreciable record of service, have been fully merited coming only from God and loyalty, support and commitment of its core customers. “However, we don’t rule out the possibility that some overzealous staff down the line can sometimes constitute obstacles to realisation of our corporate policy of prompt, enjoyable and safer road transport service for our valued customers. We shall continue to train, re- train and reorient them to become better service delivery agents. Meanwhile, we urge the travelling public, particularly our esteemed dedicated customers, to remain calm and continue to support us as we strive to provide them always, with better, safer and affordable travel facilities.”
