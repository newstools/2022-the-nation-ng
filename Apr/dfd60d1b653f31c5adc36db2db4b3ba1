Manchester City made an instant return to the top of the Premier League with a comfortable win over struggling Burnley. Liverpool’s victory over Watford earlier on Saturday had knocked the defending champions off the summit for the first time since 4 December, but Pep Guardiola’s side responded in impressive style at Turf Moor.

Sterling and De Bruyne combined again for the second goal, but this time it was Ilkay Gundogan who provided the finish – a cool volley past Nick Pope after Sterling found him in space inside the area. By now, City were in complete control and could afford to see Sterling, Jack Grealish, and substitute Gabriel Jesus waste excellent chances because Burnley never looked remotely capable of mounting a comeback.
