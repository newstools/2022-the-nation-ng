Alex Iwobi’s dramatic 99th -minute winner against Newcastle United has been voted by Evertonians as the Club’s Davanti Tyres Goal of the Month for March. Iwobi calmly slotted home after being played in by Dominic Calvert-Lewin to send Goodison Park into raptures and secure a vital three points for the 10-man Toffees. Iwobi’s strike beat Claire Emslie’s clinical finish for Everton Women against Manchester United at Old Trafford to second place in the vote, with the first of Salomon Rondon’s two goals against Boreham Wood in third place.

The Nigeria international reportedly covered a total of 11.5km and made 26 sprints, both of which were not bettered by any other individual on the pitch. Paying tribute to this all-action display, Wright saluted the commendable work ethic of the ex-Arsenal man. “He was magnificent, and he’s somebody that no matter how he’s playing – even when he played against West Ham and made a mistake – he does not stop trying to get on the ball, to be progressive,” said Wright on Match of the Day. “It was his work rate today. This is the kind of performance you want to see from somebody at home. The Everton fans want to see [it] because if they’re going to get themselves out of this predicament, it’s this kind of work rate.”
