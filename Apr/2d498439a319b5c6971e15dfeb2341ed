President Muhammadu Buhari will this year receive the traditional Sallah homage by the residents of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, at the Aso Rock Villa, in commemoration of the Eid-el-Fitr. A statement issued by Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, which disclosed this on Friday, recalled that the  homage is returning to the Presidency after two years of halt, following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The statement, however, noted that though the return of the homage indicates that the country, as the rest of the world, is getting respite from the spread of the pandemic, all guests would be required to wear facemasks, as well as undergo a mandatory linear COVID-19 test at the Villa before being allowed in.
