Spokesperson of Police Command in the state, SP Yemisi Opalola, had earlier confirmed that Ogbara was killed at 12.00 midnight on Monday by unknown gunmen at his Igangan residence. It was also learnt that the deceased’s wife, Ruth, and his child, were also wounded by the hoodlums and are currently receiving treatment at an undisclosed hospital in Ilesa.
