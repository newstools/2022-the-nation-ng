Ex-Miss World Uganda Oliver Nakakande has launched a foundation to identify and address the causes of rising incidences of girls dropping out of school. Nakakande, who is the winner of the 2019-2020 Miss World Uganda beauty pageant says the scope of the Oliver Nakakande Foundation includes empowering teenage mothers who have dropped out of school as she believes strongly in second chances.   I can only marry a financially stable man, Carolyna…     Marriage? Count me out, says Iyabo Ojo     Teni Makanaki thrills at Gbenga Adeyinka’s Laffmattazz show   According to her, getting teenage mothers to return to school is one of her driving forces as now, more than ever, Africa needs to come together to cultivate the power of education. “Education, especially where the girl child is concerned is not something to be trivialised, that is why I am pooling resources to see that every Ugandan girl remains in school. Speaking further, she notes that though the foundation is targetting girls from Uganda at the moment, there are plans to increase the scope of its operations and make it a continent-wide affair.
