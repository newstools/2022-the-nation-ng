Muslims across the globe commenced fasting on Saturday following the sighting of the moon. Every adult Muslim is expected to fast during the month for 29 (or sometimes 30) days, except those who are exempted due to a stipulated number of conditions. During this month, Muslims make some changes in their daily routines including their eating and sleeping pattern. They also abstain from unholy acts from dawn to sunset. Unbalanced meals during Ramadan, on the other hand, might cause health problems such as excessive weight loss or gain, as well as heartburn. Here are some of the foods Muslims should avoid during Ramadan (Suhoor and Iftar): · Simple or refined Carbohydrates White bread, white rice and pastries, among others, should be avoided during Suhoor. These are foods that last only three to four hours and low in essential nutrients. So they’re highly discouraged during Sahur.
