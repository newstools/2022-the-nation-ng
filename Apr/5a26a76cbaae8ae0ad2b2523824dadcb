A Northern group under the auspices of Aminu Kano Political Followers, has told the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and its supporters to endorse the National Leader of the party, Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu as its consensus candidate to record easy victory in the 2023 presidential poll. “Making Tinubu the presidential flagbearer will translate to victory for the party in the 2023 general election,” leader of the Aminu Kano Political Followers, Fashola Adeyemi, said, advising the APC to adopt the party’s leader through consensus. Adeyemi addressed a press conference shortly after leading a peaceful march past that terminated at the APC Secretariat along Maiduguri Road, Kano. “The match past is to drum support for Tinubu’s consensus candidature,” he told the press.   Vandalisation of power lines caused electricity grid…     Expose bandits in our midst, Lai Mohammed begs Nigerians     EFCC challenges court order to release Obiano’s…   Adeyemi also said the consensus candidature of the former Lagos State Governor will not stop at victory for the party but also bring consolidation on the gains and achievements of the Muhammadu Buhari administration. “We have followed with keen interest the activities, achievements and commitment of Chief Bola Tinubu over the years up-to-date and we realise that, it will only be wise and in the best interest of our great party, the APC to endorse Bola Tinubu as the consensus candidate and flag bearer of the party in the forthcoming general election in 2023.” “His relationship and association with the North has given him the privilege to enjoy mass support and followership. “Equally, he is an experienced, eminently qualified, detribalised Nigerian, who is passionate about the welfare and well-being of the people. “His antecedents are everywhere for anyone to see. Beyond reasonable doubt, he remains the best man to fly the party’s flag in the general election.”
