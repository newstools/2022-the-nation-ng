For this reason, I have decided to run for office, to provide credible representation to my people in Ondo, and to attract much-needed development to them.” Olumbe said he will be proposing legislation that prioritises the welfare of workers, protects them from bad employers, and provides them with a safety net. “I will make it a priority to champion gender bills. It is rather sad that our women are treated unfairly. Women deserve better representation in parliament and cabinet positions both at the state and federal levels,” he said.
