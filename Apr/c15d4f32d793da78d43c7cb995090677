Art is not something that is created out of thinking, it’s created out of doing. You just open your mouth and sing,” she said. Continuing, the 26-year-old singer, who gained global recognition after collaborating with Wizkid on the song, ‘Essence,’ said “Art is an extension of you. Everybody cannot like your art because everybody cannot understand you. Everybody cannot receive what you’re trying to send. And what you’re really just trying to send is the truth from your eyes. How you see life, everybody can’t see how life, the way you see life. So why worry about whether they’ll see it from your perspective. If you don’t, you don’t, I’ll be fine either way. I’m still alive.” The ‘Crazy’ singer also said she would never regret any of her songs saying, “I would never regret anything I released because I know that came from my soul and that’s what is important. Every single song came from a true place.”
