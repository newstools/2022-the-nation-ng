Nutritionists say it is important for people fasting to be aware of the importance of healthy nourishment. During fasting hours when no food or drink is consumed, the body may become mildly dehydrated. When first breaking the fast, drinks with natural electrolytes and essential vitamins like juices or yoghurt can provide energy, and replace fluids that are good to keep the stomach balanced, which is exactly what is required after a whole day of not eating,” she added.
