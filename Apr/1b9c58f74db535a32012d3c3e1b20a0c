RAPPER Folarin Falana aka Falz has expressed concerns about the poor state of electricity supply and insecurity among other basic amenities in Nigeria. This is coming after the recent attack on the Kaduna-Abuja rail by bandits and terrorists. The award-winning music star, who is quite outspoken about bad governance and societal ills, also noted that the country’s health care system is nothing to talk about. He made this statement on his Twitter page recently. “No electricity, fuel scarce, no jobs, Naira all the way down, students are not in school, no public healthcare to treat ordinary man wey dey sick.

And now rail bombings have been added to the mix,” said Falz. Continuing, he said, “this place is in absolute shambles and it’s rather insane that everyone is constantly adjusting and acting like this is a country. “Back to back bombings on the Kaduna-Abuja rail. Numerous Nigerian lives needlessly wasted. Absolute nothing has been uttered about this. Do you know what these animals are busy doing? Announcing that they want to be president, Organizing political rallies, announcing that they want to start collecting toll gate money. “Soldiers committed gruesome murders on innocent Nigerians on the night of October 20, 2020. “The reports of the Judicial Panel set up by the government indicted the LCC. Despite being complicit in these gory crimes, LCC is brave enough to announce toll collection.”
