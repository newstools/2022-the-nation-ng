The Bayelsa State Government has solicited the partnership of international oil companies (IOCs) and other corporate bodies doing business in the state for the promotion of sports development. Deputy Governor Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo made the appeal when a delegation of the Bayelsa State chapter of the Sports Writers’ Association of Nigeria (SWAN) paid him a courtesy visit in Government House, Yenagoa. Ewhrudjakpo said the development of sports in Nigeria deserved more attention and resources than it was getting at the moment, insisting that the sports sector in the country had not been given its rightful place of priority.

The Deputy Governor said government alone could not adequately meet up the task of investing in sports. He, therefore, called on oil firms including the Nigerian Agip Oil Company (NAOC), Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), and other corporate organizations to collaborate with the state government to invest in the promotion of sports in the state. According to Ewhrudjakpo, plans are underway for the local governments to organize sports festivals for the identification and development of budding talents.
