Supreme Head of Cherubim and Seraphim Unification Church of Nigeria Adegboyega Alao has called on the Federal Government to remain truthful  to the people. He believed those parading themselves as the nation’s ‘messiahs’ could not do much to salvage the country from its quagmire. The cleric urged Nigerians to elect able leaders in next year’s elections. Prophet Alao spoke on the sidelines of a meeting of critical stakeholders of the church. He said: “What I have seen in this  country is that those parading themselves as progressives lack the sincerity to deliver on their promise.

We cannot continue like this.” Prophet Alao solicited support  for the proposed Moses Orimolade University (MOU) at Omu-Aran, Kwara State. He went on: “I have called the stakeholders to galvanise support for completion of the project. The cleric reiterated opposition of the church to the multiplicity of Ark of Covenant by its members, which has been bastardised today. “Ark of Covenant is dead. Before the birth of Jesus Christ, God gave Moses Ark of covenant because Israelites were very had to control. But the Bible has forbidden that now as  captured in Jeremiah 3 vs 16.” He urged all Seraphs to collect their PVCs so as to actively participate in the choice of the nation’s leaders during the coming general elections in 2023.
