Whether you’re aspiring for the smallest or the highest position, you must have the base, which is home. This we have provided for our leader the former Vice President in his aspiration for the presidency of Nigeria for the 2023 general elections. “We have started the scheming, working, and canvassing for support, and very soon you’ll see him emerging as the flag bearer of the Peoples Democratic Party,” Fintiri said. He asserted that with Atiku as president, the unity of Nigeria will be assured and insecurity will become a thing of the past. He said: “Atiku has the experience and he understands the dynamics of this country and I believe he will be able to close the gap and bring us together as a nation and that will solve part of the security challenges we are facing in this country.” ,,,,,, Fintiri arriving the Yola International Airport Sunday night
