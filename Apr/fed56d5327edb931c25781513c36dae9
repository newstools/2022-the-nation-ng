The protest against the management of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC) by hundreds of casual workers of the Warri Refining and Petrochemical Company (WRPC), in Warri, Delta state, entered day two, Friday. The protest which is ongoing inside the premises of the WRPC continued to ground activities of the company. The protesting workers, some of whom have worked for 28 years, are demanding “conversion from casual to permanent staff, increase in salary, payment of all outstanding allowances, better working condition and welfare.” Some are requesting payoffs, since the NNPC management has “refused” to yield to their demand for regularisation over the years.

The protesters accused the NNPC management of consistently lying and failing to honour promises made over the issue that has lingered for many years. Bearing leaves and placards with inscriptions such as “No conversion, no quick fix,” “15, 25, 27 years of slavery must stop,” “NNPC stop technical lies,” “WRPC, KRPC, PRPC must work,” “Increase our salary,” among others, they chanted solidarity songs. Speaking to the protesting workers, Friday, the Manager, Personnel and Employment of WRPC, urged them to return to their offices, as management was on top of the matter.
