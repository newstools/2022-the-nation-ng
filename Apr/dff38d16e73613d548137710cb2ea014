The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) yesterday urged subscribers barred from making calls from their phones to link their Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) with their National Identity Number (NIN), else they would remain barred. The regulator explained that this information became necessary in view of a viral web link (https://bit.ly/NCC-Sim-Unbar-Gov-Ng) being circulated on social media and on some websites. It said: “The link and accompanying narrative represent patent misinformation and disinformation designed to mislead the public about the SIM cards that are barred from making calls, due to non-linkage with NIN at the set deadline. “The misleading, viral message mischievously displays NCC logo and ostensibly promises members of the public that, by clicking the web link and following further instructions in that regard, subscribers with barred SIM cards can unbar such SIMs across mobile networks without a valid NIN. “For the avoidance of doubt, the NCC wishes to state categorically that it never issued such statement, directing subscribers or indicating that subscribers can unbar their SIM without a NIN. As such, the originators and peddlers of the spurious message were out to mischievously mislead unsuspecting members of public. Therefore, their message should be disregarded.’’ “The NCC is the national regulatory authority for telecommunications in Nigeria, and it is co-driving the process of the NIN-SIM linkage with the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) as directed by the Federal Government.

The Commission listed the steps the affected telecom subscribers would take to get their SIMs actively connected to make calls. “First, for subscribers that have not registered for their NIN, what to do is to get their SIM registered at accredited centres across the country and then link the NIN with their SIM cards through channels provided by their service providers. “Secondly, for subscribers with registered NINs, what to do is to simply go and link the NIN with their SIMs through channels provided by their service providers,” the NCC said. The NCC reiterated its commitment to the Federal Government’s directive on the NIN-SIM linkage to among others, strengthen security situation in the country, assist in other socio-economic planning activities of the government, as well as to always advance the course of consumer protection from falling victim to the antics of cyber fraudsters. “Finally, the NCC wishes to also inform the general public that it is not recruiting at the moment.  Accordingly, the advertisement indicating there is ongoing recruitment at NCC, which is circulating on Twitter, and through polymediation, may have been diffused to other social media networks, is a scam and should be disregarded,” it added.
