Controversy has trailed a statement credited to one Olugbenga Olaoye, a co-convener of ‘Osinbajo Think Tank’ making reference to President Muhammadu Buhari’s health history. The statement elicited a flurry of reactions on social media. Olaoye’s statement drew the ire of some Osinbajo’s supporters. But Osinbajo’s spokesman, Laolu Akande, urged members of the public to ‘ignore’ statements from the ‘Osinbajo Think Tank’ group. Olugbenga Olaoye, a co-covener of Osinbajo Think Tank, had granted a television interview on Arise TV where he referred to Buhari’s health as one of the reasons to vote for Osinbajo to be elected president in 2023. “We all know what happened to President Muhammadu Buhari at the inception of his administration,” Olaoye said.   I’m not running to negotiate for vice presidency –…     Rivers PDP, 32 aspirants clash over non-issuance of…     Immigration arrests passenger with firearms at Lagos airport   “He spent a lot of period out of Nigeria because of his ill-health.” He said that allowed “some people” to hijack the running of the country from the president. But Akande said Olaoye and his group do not represent the vice-president who on Monday declared his interest to succeed Buhari in office. “Indeed this gentleman does not represent the VP or the Office,” Akande said. “His views are completely & totally his own.” Laolu Tweeted. Osinbajo’s spokesman said: “This particular opinion he has expressed on TV is deplorable and in bad taste. I am not even aware of the so-called Osinbajo Think Tank he purports to represent. “Just so we are clear, the gentleman is Olugbenga Olaoye who was a guest on AriseTV Morning Show yesterday morning.”
