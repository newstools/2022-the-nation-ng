A family has solicited N10 million for their son, Emmanuel Ikechukwu Njoku, who needs to undergo a second surgery for hole in heart. Emmanuel’s mother, Joy, explained he has been due for it since 2019. She noted the N10 million will also cover for flight and visa. “We had to sell off everything we had to take him to India for a heart surgery which was successful. “We were asked to come back after 4 years for a corrective procedure. “This is 7 years now post-surgery and we are not able to go back,” she said. A proposed treatment plan in a medical report sighted by The Nation, corroborating Joy’s claims, reads: “Atrial septal defect (ASD) transcatheter repair needs a second surgery after re-assessment, will plan for Surgical Ligation Possible and Minor DS suspected.
