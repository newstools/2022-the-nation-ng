The Imam, who gave the advice in his Ramadan tafsir in Ilorin, warned that Allah do not love hurtful speech and advised Muslims to beware of all utterances. He said that there was power in speech and “that some individuals used their tongues to cause disunity and rancour”.   ‘NASFAT should deepen youth education’     Kebbi to distribute 65,000 bags of foodstuffs to needy     How Nigeria can be great, by Popoola   The cleric specifically advised couples, especially women against disreputing their husbands, looking down on them because of economic challenges, and causing them sadness. Olayiwola warned Muslims against double standard, pointing out that polygamous men who did not treat their wives equally, were sinning in the sight of Allah. “Do not speak ill about your spouses whether male or female. Don’t indulge in speaking ills about others behind their back,” he said.
