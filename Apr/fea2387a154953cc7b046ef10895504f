Quadri Aruna’s TTC RhönSprudel Fulda-Maberzell will be chasing a third-place finish in the league in the Table Tennis Bundesliga (TTBL), today to avoid a semifinal play-off against Borussia Dusseldorf.   A 2-3 home loss to Mühlhausen 10 days ago put TTC in a tight corner in the final match of the league when they visit TTC Schwalbe Bergneustadt later today in the last league match of the 2021/2022 season.   Therefore, Aruna and his TTC’s teammates are under intense pressure to win in the fight for the third place and they would expectedly need some help following earlier defeat to Mühlhausen who is their direct competitor for the third position.   Lose     Amaju Pinnick gets new FIFA role     Canada 2-2 Nigeria: NFF pledges investment in women’s…     Qatar 2022: Eagles to face Mexico, Ecuador in friendly   A win for TTC against Bergneustadt as against a loss by   Mühlhausen against Bad Königshofen will give Aruna’s TTC a third place finish and avoid Borussia Düsseldorf in in the playoffs.   “It will be a difficult game,” said Stefan Frauenholz, President of TTC.   TTC had beaten their host twice this season after winning the first leg of the league and the German Cup in a closed contest.   “A typical 50-50 game,” added Frauenholz.   For the first time in four years, TTC will be competing in the play-offs and the organisers of the league have fixed May 8th and 15th for the semi-final play-offs with the final scheduled for June 11 in Frankfurt.
