Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Dr Mohammad Abubakar has said the Federal Government’s collaboration with donor-assisted projects have yielded results in the development of agri-business hubs. The partnership, he said, is significant in food security, job creation, rural development and economic diversification. Abubakar spoke yesterday in Abuja at the inauguration and meeting of the national steering committees of donor funded projects being implemented under the ministry. He said over the years projects have been without steering committees, thereby making it difficult to track their performance, especially the approval and monitoring of Annual Workplan and Budget (AWPB). The AWPB is the core responsibility of the steering committee as contained in the Project Appraisal Document.

He added that members are expected to consider and approve the 2022 workplan and budget of the five projects. Permanent Secretary of the ministry, Dr. Ernest Umakhihe, said the idea will encourage large scale mechanised agricultural production, small holder farmers along the value chain of production, processing and marketing. He urged members to align the project activities towards promotion of commercial agriculture to ensure food sustainability, job creation and income generation. Umakhihe: “As members of the national steering committee of the donor partners assisted projects, you are expected to assist in addressing the challenges bedevilling the projects, Consider and approve the Annual Work-Plan and Budget  as well as support on policy matters and general oversight of the projects among others”.
