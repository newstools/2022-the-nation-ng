Nine–time African champions, Super Falcons are confident of a better outing against Olympic Champions Canada when both teams square up in the second of their two-match bouquet in the North American country in the early hours of tomorrow.   Two second goals by Jessie Fleming and Vanessa Gilles earned the world’s sixth-ranked team victory over the African champions in their first encounter in Vancouver on Friday (Saturday morning in Nigeria). However, Coach Randy Waldrum prosecuted that game with only 14 outfield players, most of whom arrived on the eve of the match due to late issuance of visas from their respective bases.

This second encounter will take place at the Starlight Stadium, and will commence at 7.30 pm Canada time (3.30 am Tuesday in Nigeria). The two-match tour is part of the NFF’s general plan to prepare the Falcons adequately for the 12th Women Africa Cup of Nations finals taking place in Morocco 2nd – 23rd July this year, at which Africa’s four flag-bearers at next year’s FIFA Women’s World Cup finals in Australia/New Zealand will emerge.
