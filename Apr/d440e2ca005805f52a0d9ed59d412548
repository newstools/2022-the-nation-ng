In a bid to tackle extortion, harassment, and brutality, the Nigerian Police Force has said it will hold Police Area Commanders and Divisional Police Officers (DPOs) responsible for the actions of junior officers under their watch. The move by the police follows continued complaints by Nigerians on social media about extortion and bullying by police officers, particularly at highway checkpoints. The acting Force Public Relations Officer, Muyiwa Adejobi, stated this on his official Twitter page.

He said: “In a bid to reduce or possibly put a stop to extortion, harassment and brutality in the NPF, we will henceforth hold DPOs and Commanders responsible for the misdeeds of their men. “In as much as we don’t promote vicarious liability we have equally noticed that some superiors fail or lack the willingness and/or wherewithal to supervise and manage their men. “This leadership gap is not in tune with the leadership styles of the IGP and his repositioning drives, thus, counterproductive and condemnable.”
