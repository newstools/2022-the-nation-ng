Ogidan explained that, “Following the cordial and mutually-beneficial relationship that has existed between the two great institutions, management of Polaris Bank deemed it fit to contribute to strengthening the bursary and administrative operations of the school through provision of modern office equipment and tools. “We are considering this partnership for the long term benefit, and not just for the profits alone. We want to give back in our own little way, in line with the Bank’s CSR strategic pillar of Education to ensure the sustainability of both the school and Polaris Bank,” she added.
