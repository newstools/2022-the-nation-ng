Children are faced daily in fact inundated with s3xual images”, he wrote. “All the songs the media feeds them, everything is hyper sexualised. S3x tapes of their media created role models everywhere coupled with the internet. “Just start s3x education early instead of forming saint. “In my generation, 14 year olds were already doing it or planning to do it.
