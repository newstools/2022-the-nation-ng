Following a scare over his availability for this weekend’s Serie A match against Fiorentina, Victor Osimhen has assured Napoli fans that he would be ready to lead the attack against the visitors on Sunday. There were concerns over Osimhen’s health as the Nigerian came out early from yesterday’s training session due to a soreness in his left thigh. Even Napoli management were worried over the availability of the Super Eagles striker. But a few hours after the training, Osimhen came out to assure the fans that he will be there for Napoli on Sunday.

Tuttosport also highlighted the crazy numbers of the Nigerian center forward in 2022. “In fact, in 2021, from August to January, in 11 games played (for a total of 851 minutes), the Nigerian scored 5 goals: one goal every 170 , 2 minutes played. “From January to today, however, in the 6 games played (for a total of 601 minutes) he has already scored 6 goals, one every 100.2 minutes. Napoli enjoys Osimhen and his amazing state of form, then when the games are over, it will be understood if the future of the Nigerian will still be in blue or elsewhere,” Tuttosport wrote.
