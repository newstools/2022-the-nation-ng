The traditional ruler of Edunabon community in Osun State, Oba Kehinde Oladepo, has said that he has forgiven his subjects who invaded his palace and razed it. Oba Oladepo spoke after the court proceedings at the Osun State Magistrate Court in Osogbo where four of his subjects, namely Oluseye Oyirinde, Amos Obalana, Adisa Yekini and Nasiru Adebayo are facing trial over allegations bordering on conspiracy, perjury and making false statement to the police so as to secure the bail of others involved in the destruction of the palace. The four defendants were arraigned by the police in 2019 after it was discovered that they presented to the police a false medical report from Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital Complex (OAUTHC) on Chief Odebode Akande. At the sitting on Friday, the police prosecutor, ASP John Idoko, informed the presiding Magistrate, Dr Olusegun Ayilara that the complainant, Oba Oladepo, had written to the court on his decision to discontinue with the case.   Amaechi and implications of Electoral Act’s Section 84 (12)     2023: Tinubu, Amaechi, four others seeking APC presidential…     2023: Why I want to succeed Buhari, by Amaechi   Ayilara put the complainant on oath over his decision to discontinue the case against the four defendants and subsequently struck it out. He, however, bonded the four defendants with the sum of N1 million each for one year, warning that they must not throw any celebration over the matter else he would order their arrest. Speaking about the matter, Oba Oladepo said: “I have forgiven all those that attacked my palace and razed property. “They are my subjects and the litigation against them is enough to scold them. “My withdrawal of the case against them is for peace to reign in my domain, and we should continue in peace.”
