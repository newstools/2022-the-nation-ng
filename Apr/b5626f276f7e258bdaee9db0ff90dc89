Celebrated TV show host Frank Edoho has urged youths to go ahead and become successful without people’s validation. The ‘Who wants to be a Millionaire’ star made this known in an exclusive chat with The Nation. “Let me use this medium to pass this short message to youth. You don’t need validation from anybody to be successful,” he said.   I didn’t join Nollywood, Nollywood joined me, says…     You can count side chicks, not wives – Cubana Priest     Yul Edochie’s parents at fault he took second wife…   The trained Animal Scientist- turned-broadcaster further said youths should endeavour to chart their paths and not wait for people’s validation. “Like the saying, success has a lot of relatives. Don’t wait for someone else to approve of you, just do your thing and chart your course without looking for validation from someone else,” Edoho said. Edoho returned to TV screens after the rebirth of the ‘Who Wants To Be A Millionaire’ show several weeks back and has been in the news for his return as the tv show host after almost 20-years of experience.
