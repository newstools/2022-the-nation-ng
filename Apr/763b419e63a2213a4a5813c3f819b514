WBC and Ring Magazine champion Tyson Fury weighed in 12lb lighter than his previous fight for Saturday’s blockbuster heavyweight bout against Dillian Whyte at Wembley. Fury, 33, hit the scales at 18st 12lb, while challenger Whyte weighed in at 18st 1lb. The two Britons will fight in front of 94,000 fans – a post-war British record – with Fury making a second defence of the title he won against Deontay Wilder in February 2020. “I’m so happy to be back here fighting at Wembley Stadium and you people made it happen – you all made it happen,” Fury said.

Don’t doubt us, we’re going to give you a real fight, a real war.” Whyte, dressed in all black, took to the stage first and was dealt a chorus of boos by the Fury-friendly crowd at BoxPark in Wembley. The 34-year-old was certainly not bothered about Fury’s size advantage when asked about the significance of their respective weights. “Nothing, some fights are different,” Whyte said. “Fighting a bigger guy, a much heavier guy than me. “We’re ready to go to war, trust me. I’m not worried about what he’s doing.”
