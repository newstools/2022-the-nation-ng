Speaking on his choice of feature, he said “I have known Bobby Saka for a while and I have also supported him in any little way as an artist. I just rounded up my upcoming body of work project which was in the mixing and mastering stage when Bobby reached out to me that he has a song for me and he would like us to work on it, at first I was reluctant because at that time I have concluded selecting the songs on my debut project. But after about two weeks I reached out to him and said let’s get it done, and then we made a hit.”
