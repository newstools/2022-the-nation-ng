Oyo Governor Seyi Makinde has vowed that the State will not spare anything to give the late Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi a befitting burial. He appealed to the Oyo Mesi, the Council of Chiefs and all those that will be involved in the selection of another Alaafin, not to delay in the process. He said this was necessary so that some wishes of the late Alaafin, which he was privy to can be fulfilled. Apparently reacting to social media rumor in a comical manner, Makinde said he was not the one responsible for the deaths of foremost monarchs in the State.
