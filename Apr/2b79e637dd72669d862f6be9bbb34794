Five-time champion Tiger Woods is planning to play in this week’s Masters just 14 months after suffering life-threatening injuries in a car crash. Woods will play nine holes on Wednesday before confirming the decision. But in a news conference at Augusta National yesterday the American said “as of right now, I am going to play”. When asked if he thought he could equal Jack Nicklaus’ record of six victories he replied: “I do. I don’t show up to an event unless I think I can win it.”   Al Ahly Draw Raja For CAFCL quarterfinals     Russia drops appeal on FIFA ban     CAF opens AFCON 2023 office in Abidjan   While conceding that if he never played again he would be content with his haul of 15 major titles – three behind Nicklaus’ all-time record – and joint-record 82 PGA Tour titles, Woods said he still has the desire to compete. “I think 82 is a pretty good number and 15’s not too bad either,” said the 46-year-old, who will tee off at 15:34 BST in round one on Thursday. “I feel like I can still do it. I still have the hands to do it, the body is moving good enough. I have been in worse situations and won tournaments. “I feel like if I can still compete at the highest level I am going to, but if I feel like I can’t, you won’t see me out here.”
