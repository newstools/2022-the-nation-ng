The Brazilian has taken some time to discuss the current forwards at the club, going through the situations of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Kylian Mbappe. “Those of us who have played the game know what it’s like when you change club, so there’s a need to give Messi time and things will come naturally,” he said of the Argentine, during an interview with RMC. “Everything changes, from communication to the style of play. “He’ll be back to doing great things again soon.”   Nigeria, others to import $110b worth of food by 2025     Visa partners firm on financial inclusion     Ajaokuta steel project: COVID-19, Russia-Ukraine conflict…   Ronaldinho thinks Neymar should be respected too and he discussed the way his fellow Brazilian was recently whistled by fans. “He is one of the best players in the world and wins something every year in Paris, Ronaldinho said of Neymar. “In Brazil, he is our star and our leader and people seem happier with him than the PSG fans. “I can’t stand [that they whistle him].
