Ogunbiyi said: “We have all kinds of people coming out to contest the election. Osun’s founding fathers have been disappointed with the happenings in the state. A secondary school dropout is aspiring to be the governor of a noble state like Osun. “I am still in the Osun governorship race. By God’s grace, my name will appear on the ballot paper. I will soon make public my new party. I believe Osun people are still looking for my participation and I am confident of winning the coming election by God’s grace. I urge my supporters to be patient. In a couple of days, I will give direction for them to follow.”
