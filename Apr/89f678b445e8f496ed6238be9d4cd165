The embattled leader of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) Lagos council Alhaji Musiliu Akinsanya (aka MC Oluomo) has described the dissolution of the council executive by the National Administrative Council (NAC) as effort in futility. Akinsanya said the NAC’s action was laughable as all the union members in the state have pulled out of the national body. The dissolution statement was jointly signed by NURTW National President, Alhaji Tajudeen Baruwa, and General Secretary, Alhaji Kabiru Ado Ya’u. The duo announced the Lagos State Council Secretary, Seyi Bankole, as the new head of NURTW in Lagos. MC Olu Omo reiterated that his earlier suspension was unconstitutional. According to him, the dissolution has no effect because the activity of the state council has been suspended by the Lagos State government.

However, people must know that we do not have any problem with the national body but the President,” he told The Nation. Akinsanya said the union members are waiting for the announcement of the Lagos State government on the appointment of park managers in the state. “We’ll be waiting to see how the person appointed to run the affairs of the union will act. The union has already been suspended. Is the national body saying they are more powerful than the state government? Announcing the sack of people already pulled out of the national body is a joke and laughable,” he said. Akinsanya urged members of the union in the state to remain calm.
