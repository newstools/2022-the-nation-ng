A Lagos State House of Assembly aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives’ Congress (APC), Sunkanmi David Faniyi, has urged Nigerians to intensify more on prayers for peace and tranquility to prevail in the country. Faniyi popularly called SDF, who is contesting for a ticket to represent the Apapa Constituency 1 made the call at a special Ramadan lecture/prayer-themed ‘’Quality of a good leader’’ organized in honour of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu held at Astrotuff in Apapa. Leading the prayer, Fadilatul Sheikh Abdul Ganiyu Nureni (Aboto) said: “Allah likes seeing His servants persisting in supplications and seeking for His forgiveness, mercies, and protection. It is important to engage in prayer massively. “Women were so special in the sight of Allah, hence the need for them to always use their time to pray for the peace, security, and tranquility of the society, state, and nation at large,” he added.

The aspirant, Honourable Faniyi, while speaking with newsmen, said despite being a Christian, decided to shoulder the Ramadan lecture and prayer session to seek God’s face for love, peace, and unity in Nigeria. He said proper caring for both youths and the aged will be his priority if he could be elected to represent the constituency. “I sponsored this Ramadan lecture to fully participate in preaching peace and unity in the country. Religion should not be our barrier. I believed we can achieve a better Nigeria if we are in unity. The title of this programme “quality of a good leader” was chosen to enable Nigerian leaders to understand what it takes to be a leader. A good leader should treat fellow human beings the way he/she to be treated,” he said.
