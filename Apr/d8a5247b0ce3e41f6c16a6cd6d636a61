Police arrest three youth for possession of human heart     ‘Abuja-Kaduna train bombed to teach El-Rufai…     My fiancee’s beatings led to two miscarriages –…   ”If for instance, those who attacked my people know that the locals also have arms, they won’t come, and even they do, the casualty will not be this high. “But there must be regulation on the use of the arms; anyone who misuses it should be imprisoned or even sentenced to death by hanging. ”But I tell you, if citizens are allowed to carry this arms to protect themselves, all these attacks and killings will end,” he said. Gagdi called on security agencies to always work on intelligence reports at their disposals to avert invidences that could lead to security breach.
