There seems to be no solution in sight to the crisis between Lekoil Limited and Lekoil Nigeria, with the former saying it has rejected the offer by the latter to purchase loan in the Oil Prospective Licence (OPL) 310. It would be recalled that Lekoil  had earlier secured Savannah Investment’s £.9million loan at five per cent per annum interest for the deal, but was stopped by Lekoil Nigeria through litigation. Subsequently, Lekoil Nigeria, last week, offered to buy the OPL 310 loan and to repay the outstanding amount under the Savannah Energy Investments Limited Convertible Facility Agreement (Savannah and Savannah CFA).

In a statement, the company’s Interim Executive Chairman, Anthony Hawkins, explained: “The offer by Lekoil Nigeria to purchase the OPL 310 loan and the outstanding amount under the Savannah Convertible Facility Agreement is not capable of acceptance as it would put the Company in breach of its legally binding contractual obligations to Savannah.” Hawkins noted that even if the offer was capable of acceptance, it was not clear that it would be a superior offer. This position, he further explained, is based on the following reasons that Lekoil Nigeria has not demonstrated the capability to fund the offer; it has not, since 2013, shown any evidence of the ability to fund the appraisal and/or development of OPL 310 (the licence for which is due to expire in August 2022 due to inactivity); it would be using Group cash to which the shareholders already have an entitlement to; it has chosen to conduct the negotiation process by way of public announcement rather than private dialogue with the company. “For these reasons, the offer should not be seen as a serious attempt to provide an alternative to the company and its shareholders but as an attempt to muddy the waters prior to the Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM). I would encourage shareholders to vote by way of proxy at the EGM in favour of the resolutions,” the statement said.
