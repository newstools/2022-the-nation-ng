The CEO of HIKOD, an ushering agency that caters to event hosts, Oyedeji is set to add the title of author to her name with her soon-to-be-released book, ‘The Business Of Treating People Like Royalty.’ According to the mother and wife, the book is a manual of sorts on running a successful agency.   It’s my turn to shutdown 02 Arena – Uzo     I’m happy to be back after 10 years, says Shan George     Standing out in saturated music industry is challenging,…   Speaking about the book, she said, “It is a manual and a guide for aspirants of the ushering business. I want anyone that picks it to understand the intricacies of the ushering business. In a way, it will make you value people in service; from the person that opens the door for you to the person that seats you, to the person that serves you. You understand that indeed, it is a prestigious job. It also teaches you to respect people in their profession. That someone takes in emotions from different people and waits upon you is not something to be taken lightly. It is also not an opportunity to throw insults and be disrespectful to them. That N2000 or N5000 you give cannot repair the damage you do. Oyedeji also attacked the perception of ushers being compared to prostitutes saying a lot of people underestimate ushers. On how she began the job, she said, “it started from being moral, courteous, and respectful according to our culture. I used to volunteer in so many organisations, including When Women Pray (WWP) an inter-denominational women’s fellowship. When I filled out the form back then, My pastor changed what I had filled in and pushed me into ushering. It was out of submission to authority that I agreed and joined the ushering department.”
