Barely 24hours after the national leadership of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) announced the costs of its nomination and expression of interest forms, a group issued a N100 million cheque for a frontline presidential aspirant, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu to purchase his. The group, Tinubu Support Organisation(TSO), said it did so because of its belief in the capacity of Tinubu to positively transform Nigeria as President. TSO Director-General Aminu Suleimon  announced the decision via a message he posted on the group’s platform yesterday. The message reads “Director-General Tinubu Support Organisation (TSO) Hon. Aminu Suleiman signs N100 million cheque to purchase APC presidential form for Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. 		 			2023: Only PDP can fix Nigeria, says Ayu		 		 		 			One killed, others injured in Osun clash		 		 		 			PHOTOS: Buhari presides over National Security Council…		 		 “Speaking this(yesterday) evening, Hon.
