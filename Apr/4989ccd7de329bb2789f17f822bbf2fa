Nnaji Charity says African mentality makes men feel…     My dad insists on getting degree – rising act Dannyello     TAYO SOBOLA: Being a hard worker has kept my husband   When asked what she would have been doing if not acting, she said “You know before I used to say acting because that is all I have ever known since I was a kid but then I think I would have been studying the behavior of human beings, why people behave the way they behave you know, because when you get a script you start to read it and start to ask questions why this character is like this? What motivates this character to do this and things like that so it is the same way I am very much interested in human beings like why are we the way we are you know, is it something from our background, is it something that we learned I am very much interested in that so I will say maybe behavioral science if there is any course like that,” she said. Last weekend the movie star hosted her colleagues, friends, and well-wishers to a star-studded bridal shower in preparation for her wedding to businessman, Fidelis Anosike scheduled for April 18, 2022, and April 19, 2022, in Imo state.
