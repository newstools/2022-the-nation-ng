Watford will still be without Cucho Hernandez for this weekend’s trip to Manchester City, with the attacker set for a lengthy spell on the sidelines. The Colombian, who scored in the reverse leg against City, injured his hamstring during the defeat to Leeds United at Vicarage Road almost two weeks ago. But there is better news, however, for Super eagles defender William Troost-Ekong, who has overcome the hamstring problem that kept him sidelined for the home loss to Brentford last weekend. The Nigerian stand-in captain is yet to feature under Roy Hodgson, but is available for the trip to the Etihad should he be needed.

Kalu’s ankle problem and Sierralta’s calf injury meant they were unable to train last week. Both returned to training yesterday, however only with modified sessions. While the return to training is good news for both, it remains unlikely that they will be available to play as soon as this weekend. The club have also stated that “two other members” of the squad are “nursing knocks” and require assessment before the trip to Manchester.
