Portuguese coach Jose Peseiro might be handed the reins of the Super Eagles as the former Real Madrid assistant manager is on a shortlist of four coaches being touted for the national team’s top job. The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has reportedly listed four top coaches for the vacant position with former Barcelona manager Ernesto Valverde; former PSG and France coach Laurent Blanc and former PSV Eindhoven manager Phillip Cocu as other candidates being listed along with Peseiro. Incidentally, Peseiro was last December announced as the next substantive coach and was expected to take over from coach Austin Eguavoen after the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Cameroon until negotiation broke down with the NFF. “After several weeks of negotiations, during which several news came out, on the part of NFF, that I would be the coach of their national team from the end of AFCON 2021, a fact that I never confirmed, these were not materialized due to disagreement regarding contractual clauses and financial matters,” Peseiro noted in an Instagram post in February.

Meanwhile, the NFF has reportedly lined up new coaches for the U-20, U-17, and U-23 teams with regular names still believed to be favourites. Ladan Bosso is expected to retain his Flying Eagles job while former Nigerian midfielder, Nduka Ugbade is expected to be named the Golden Eaglets’ coach. Fatai Amoo may head the Dream Team where he will be in charge of the U-23.
