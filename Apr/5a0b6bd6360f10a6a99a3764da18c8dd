They promised me that they will complete the project by today. ”Have they completed the structures? Yes, but I didn’t see the landscaping. So, I said until they complete the landscaping, I will not be able to bring the president here. ”If they complete the landscaping, we can then bring the president to come and inaugurate the project, but it appears they have finished the structures,” he said. The minister also said that the Kano-Kaduna rail project, was encountering some setbacks, expressing the hope that it would be addressed by the governor of the affected state. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the minister also visited the Emir of Daura, Alhaji Farouk Umar Farouk.
