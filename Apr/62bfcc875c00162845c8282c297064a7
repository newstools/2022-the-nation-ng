RISING music act, Daniel Edoreh aka Dannyello has revealed how his father insists on him getting a degree despite his love for pursuing a career in music. “Daddy is insistent that I do not mortgage my education for music and I am working hard to combine both very well,” he said in a brief chat with The Nation. The 200-level undergraduate of the Federal University of Petroleum Engineering is looking forward to the release of his first single entitled ‘Kala’ on April 29.   I would have been behavioural scientist, says Rita Dominic     Nnaji Charity says African mentality makes men feel…     TAYO SOBOLA: Being a hard worker has kept my husband   Speaking on his upcoming single, Dannyello says, “Kala is an expression of the general deep emotion we all feel in relationships and the pains and depression that we all feel we are hurt in love. There are breakups every day and virtually everyone may have suffered this at different points in life. This is because we live in a world in which great human values are getting lost, increasingly, and even love is now priced only in material terms. “So, the message of Kala is to remind the world that love still matters and to encourage humans to be patient and considerate with one another because true peace and happiness are found love.” Dannyello sees music as the print of identity and admires a number of popular and trendy artists like Davido, Alpha P, Koffee, Tems, and Burna Boy.
