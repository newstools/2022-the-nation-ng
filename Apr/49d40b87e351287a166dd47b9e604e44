Izz said she was fortunate enough to travel from a young age and believed that made her super curious about learning about music because she found it so different all over the world. “I just feel like the music culture is so rich in both countries and so much talent comes out of there. Nowhere in the world does music like that. All my new music will reflect the music I love to listen to,’’ she said. Continuing, she said, ‘‘I would love to tap into my French roots with my music side because I think what they’re doing is something super special as well. I have been trying to sit back and work on my craft. I’m not someone that likes to rush something just to get traction. My two songs, “Vibe you” and “Essence” really encapsulate who I was when I made those songs – I was still really young and only just figuring out where I wanted to go musically. I’m excited to show people what I’ve been working on and the evolution of my sound.’’
