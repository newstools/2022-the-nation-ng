Social media influencer Jennifer Onyekwelu-Udoka aka JenniFrank has called for more discretion by social media users who post on impulse on the internet. JenniFrank cautioned social media users in a three-minute video entitled “The Internet Never Forgets”. Filmed by David Cliq but scripted and directed by JenniFrank, the Tik Tok video talks about the danger of indiscriminate posting of content on social media. The warning is coming in the light of the ongoing Tiktok #ShortFilm competition.

According to her: “When people are going through stuff in their personal lives, they put it out on social media. Some people even blackmail others and put it out on social media. My video is a reminder that this can have long-term consequences that may not be so pleasant, so we should be careful of what we share.” The popular face on Tik Tok with 3.1 million followers further cautioned saying, “Think twice before you post, and that includes what repercussions could arise in a few years for the contents you are about to share with the whole wide world.”
