VoLTE has up to three times more voice and data capacity than older 3G UMTS and up to six times more than 2G GSM. It uses less bandwidth because VoLTE’s packet headers are smaller than those of unoptimised VoIP/LTE.  VoLTE calls are usually charged at the same rate as other calls”. The Chief Marketing Officer of MTN Nigeria, Adia Sowho said the service is accessible at VoLTE-enabled devices. She said: “With VoLTE, MTN Nigeria continues to enhance Nigerian lives with innovative technology.  VoLTE is free to access today at your rates, from a VoLTE-enabled smartphone so you can call and surf at the same time with no interruptions ever again.
