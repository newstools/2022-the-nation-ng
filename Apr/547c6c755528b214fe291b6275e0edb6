The Nigeria Women Football League has approved the promotion of four NWFL Nationwide teams to the NWFL Championship against the earlier two publicized by the league board. The increase was announced yesterday by the General Co-coordinator of the NWFL Nationwide, Sir Joe Amene, while addressing the four teams that qualified for the final round of the Nationwide League. The four teams are : Lakeside Queens of Lagos, Imo Strikers of Owerri, Prince Kazeem Eletu Queens of Lagos and Delta Babes of Asaba. Amene, in his statement to the teams after the last two matches played at the School of Health Technology, Benin City, noted that, the approval for the promotion of the four teams was given by the Chairperson of the Nigeria Women Football League, Aisha Falode, with the support of other board members of the NWFL, after watching all the group matches in the A1, A2, B1 and B2.

None of the teams, coaches, nor league officials had the premonition that four teams would qualify for the NWFL Championship. But they were only lifted by their excellent standard of play and maturity displayed by all the 16 teams that participated in the league. The decision to promote four NWFL Nationwide teams to the Championship was a collective one to also beef up the number of teams for the professional cadre, which is the NWFL Championship,” Amene added.
