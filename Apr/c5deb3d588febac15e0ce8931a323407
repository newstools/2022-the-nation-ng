“We have a lot of insecurity in Nigeria. By road we are not safe. By train we are not safe”.   From a survivor of the Abuja-Kaduna Train bomb; Mon., March 28, 2022   Too many ills do a nation kill Ills just as many as the corpses That clutter every gutter Of our callously mis-governed country   The roads are slaughter slabs The rails only take us on terminal journeys Every coach is a waiting coffin The nation’s graveyards puke from unspeakable excess   “Bandits”, “terrorists”: a tardy government Plays name-games while criminals Rampage without restraint   Artists mark World Poetry Day with pomp     ‘Why we’re organising schools debate on irregular…     Fresh worries as kidnappers target kids   Different name, same Nemesis   What do you call a nation Where food is scarce And peace is scarcer; where Life sells at a thousand for one kobo?   Bandits raid the homestead Bandits raid the streets Bandits raid the schools Bandits raid the temples   Bandits rack army barracks Bandits pummel police stations. . . . Our government fled long ago Without leaving a forwarding address
