Manchester United interim manager Ralf Rangnick has been named Austria boss. Rangnick will still take on his consultancy role with United as planned at the end of this season. “I’m really looking forward to playing my part in helping United become a real force again,” he said. The 63-year-old German has signed a two-year deal with Austria and will join up with them after the Premier League season ends in May. “It is an honour for me to take on the role of manager,” he said.

United are sixth in the table, five points behind fourth-placed Arsenal with three games remaining.
