Goals by Kola Ademola and Victor Ezeji saw the Ecuadorians hold the Super Eagles in Abuja before defeating Nigeria on penalties 4-3.   The Super Eagles are yet to have a new coach after former coach, Austin Eguavoen stepped down following his failure to tinker the team to a World Cup appearance. The rest of the coaching crew were also dismissed by the Nigeria Football Federation.   A number of foreign coaches have been lined up to take the Nigerian job with the federation expected to name a new coach in the coming weeks.   Nigeria lost the World Cup ticket to the Black Stars of Ghana in March after losing out on the away goal rule.
