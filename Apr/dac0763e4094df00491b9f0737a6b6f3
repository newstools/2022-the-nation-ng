Recounting how his music journey began, the Ondo-born artiste said:” I got into music because I have the passion and love for it. I had a studio close to my house in Benin city, Edo state. I’m always around that studio to learn how to make music. As time went on, I got used to it. Whenever a beat is being played, I find it easy to vibe to it. Thereafter, I became a backup singer for some artists. I started writing songs myself and recorded my first song with a producer called eyezybeat. He told me not to give up, adding that music is in me”.
