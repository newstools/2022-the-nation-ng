The Kano Police Command has paraded a suspected drug dealer, Agbo Victor, 33, for transporting 250 parcels of dried leaves of Indian Hemp valued at N1.7 million from Edo State to the ancient city of Kano. The suspect, who hails from Edo State, was arrested with the exhibits loaded in the boot of his dark green Honda Accord (Hennessy), the police said. Police spokesman, Abdullahi Haruna Kiyawa, said the suspect was nabbed by a team of Operation Puff Adder led by CSP Hassan Nasir Jega – the Officer in Charge (OC) of Highway Patrol in Kano while on surveillance along Kwanar Dangora, Kiru Local Government Area of Kaduna-Kano Border. “He was intercepted at Kaduna-Kano border,” Kiyawa, a Superintendent of Police (SP), said.
