Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly Mudashiru Obasa has felicitated with Christian faithful in the state and Nigeria as a whole. Obasa, in an Easter message by his media office, described the season as a celebration of God’s divine love for mankind, as confirmed by the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. He noted that such love, spread among neighbours, will help to put Nigeria in an enviable position among the comity of nations. According to Obasa, love comes before other considerations for a society’s existence or progress.

It is love that makes leaders want to act right, it is love that helps the followers live in unity. Even Jesus noted that loving your neighbour is one of the most important commandments of God. “It is love that will help us build faith in our country and grow it further from where it currently stands. With love, there can’t be cases of man’s inhumanity to man. “Just as Easter allows us to understand the importance of love and forgiveness, I urge Nigerians to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus with sober reflection on His virtues and lessons He left behind.”
