Recent wins for the Selecao over Chile (4-0 at home) and Bolivia (4-0 away) in the qualifiers for the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 enabled them to overtake Belgium, who had been in first place for the past three years but who failed to get the better of Republic of Ireland on March 26, drawing 2-2 in a friendly.
