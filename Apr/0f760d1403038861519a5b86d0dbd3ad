A Federal High Court in Abuja has dismissed a suit filed by an oil and gas services firm, Marine Assets and Offshore EquipMent Limited, and its General Manager, Olusegun Olaleye, seeking to stop their investigation by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). In a judgment on Tuesday, Justice Bolaji Olajuwon, held that there was no merit in the case that sought to restrain the EFCC from investigating the payment of huge sums into the plaintiffs’ bank account by some firms for unknown reasons. Justice Olajuwon disagreed with lawyer to the plaintiffs, Mike Ozekhome (SAN), that the investigation into the plaintiffs’ activities by the EFCC amounted to harassment and ultra vires its (EFCC’s) powers.

She added that contrary to the plaintiffs’ contention, the EFCC could investigate tax evasion within its powers to investigate economic and financial crimes. Justice Olajuwon rejected all the reliefs the plaintiffs sought in the suit and dismissed it for being unmeritorious.
