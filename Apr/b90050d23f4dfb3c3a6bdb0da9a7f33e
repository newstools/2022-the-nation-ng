Chairman of Innoson Vehicles Manufacturing (IVM), Innocent Chukwuma has said his company can manufacture any vehicle if given the specifications. Chukwuma, who spoke through the Head, Corporate Communications, Innoson Group, Cornel Osigwe, while taking some journalists on a tour of the firm, said the company produces 10,000 brands of vehicles annually. He said over 60 per cent of the manufacturing materials needs were sourced in Nigeria while 40 per cent were sourced from overseas. He said, “What we do have here is pure manufacturing of vehicle and not assemblage. Our vehicles go through quality control section before they are pushed to the public.
