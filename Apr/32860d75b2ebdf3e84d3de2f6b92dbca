Grammy winning singer Wizkid has reacted to the video of his former boss, Banky W’s interview with Ebuka Obi-Uchendu. The interview on Bounce Network, which featured the EME boss with his wife, Adesua centered around his former signee, Wizkid. The music executive revealed he was quite disappointed that Wizkid couldn’t make it down to his wedding because he had a show in Dubai at the time. Banky W also stated Wizkid might still be owing his record label three albums, adding he only released two out of the five as stipulated in his contract when he made known his intention to leave.

But I think it was a 5-album deal in the beginning and he had done 2 solo albums. He’d done the “Super Star” album and the “Ayo” album. “So, I think he still owed 3 more albums. But he wanted to leave and for me that was enough. Because, I don’t want anybody to stay where they don’t want to be. It would just create animosity, resentment”, the statement reads in part. Reacting to the interview the Starboy Entertainment boss via his Twitter handle, shared the video which he accompanied with the caption, “LOL” (means laughing out loud).
