Founder of the African Muzik Magazine Awards (Afrimma) Anderson Obiagwu, has noted that the Recording Academy will not be able to cover the African music landscape better than Africans with the Grammys. Anderson, the Chief Executive Officer of Big A Entertainment, made this known on his Instagram page following the loss of leading Nigerian music stars at the 64th Grammy. The entertainment executive noted that Africans lose their narratives when people seek western validation with awards. “We lose our narratives when others continue to sell our story.

The Grammy is good but nobody can tell our story better than ourselves. The time for Africa is now,” he added.
