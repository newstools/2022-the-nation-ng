Last Thursday, April 28, Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu hosted Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, an All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential aspirant at his Marina, Lagos office. For once, the governor betrayed his famed gentlemanliness when he wasted no time before telling his visitor to his face that he will not win the votes of Lagos delegates at the party’s primary elections.   2023: Drums of war in Rivers State     2023: Ogun West leaders present N50m cheque to Abiodun     Jonathan: The lust for power   Amaechi, who is on a state tour in support of his ambition, had sought the support of Sanwo-olu and other delegates. Rather than play the usual politics of prayers and promises, the governor told the minister Lagos votes are for the party’s national leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu. The governor further rubbed it in when he said the state has endorsed Tinubu. “I have sheer regard and respect for our leader Asiwaju Bola Tinubu; I have been a direct beneficiary of his leadership. I have been part of his cabinet and continue to toe that line of leadership Asiwaju stands for. For a whole lot of us in Lagos, Asiwaju continues to be our rallying point,’ the governor said. But the minister took it all in good grace, declaring that Tinubu was eminently qualified to rule Nigeria.
