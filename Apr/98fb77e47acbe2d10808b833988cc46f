Transportation Minister Rotimi Amaechi has said academic activities will start at the University of Transportation in Daura, Katsina State, in September. Amaechi announced this during an inspection of the university project to ascertain the progress of work.

On the claims that some structures were being erected around the port to get compensation from the government, the minister said: “Until I speak with the governor, I can’t respond to that. Yes, it is the responsibility of the governor to give us an unencumbered land, despite the fact that we have paid. “So, if there are problems we are encountering, we will speak with him. We are  encountering problems; that is not in dispute. But I think that the best person to resolve those disputes will be the governor of the state.”
