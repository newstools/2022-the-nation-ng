Former Ekiti State Governor Ayodele Fayose yesterday unfolded his ambition to serve as the next president. “May I also state clearly that I will be seeking the ticket of the PDP to contest the next presidential election,” he said in a statement in Lagos. The ex-governor said he never endorsed former Anambra State Governor Peter Obi for president on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).   CACOL to INEC: punish electoral offenders     Rise up to your responsibilities, APC council tells party     Kwankwaso: we’ll prioritise security, jobs, others   Fayose said the report credited to him that he had endorsed Obi and zoning of the Presidency to the Southeast was false. He added: “No doubt, I have great respect for Peter Obi as a leader and I respect his aspiration, but at no point did I endorse his presidential ambition or that the presidency be zoned to the Southeast. “Rather, my take is that the presidency should be zoned to the Southern part of Nigeria.”
