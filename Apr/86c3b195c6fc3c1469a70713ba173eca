The family of Mr. Chikere Obiechi allegedly killed by one Mohammed Useni, a policeman, at a friend’s birthday party in Egbeda area of Lagos, has called for justice for the late businessman. Representatives of the family at a press briefing in front of Obiechi’s shop at Computer Village yesterday said only justice will fill the void created by the killing. His widow, Mrs Vivian Obiechi, said his husband, a phone dealer, was invited by a friend called Ifeanyi Uchendu aka Asiwaju to his birthday party on Sunday, only to be gunned down by police inspector Mohammed Useni. A family member, Anayo Chukwu Obiechi, said Obiechi was only at the party less than two hours when he was shot dead while he was dancing and spraying money on the birthday host.

What do you want to do with his body?” Mrs Obiechi cried. “I am calling on President Muhammadu Buhari, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Senator Rochas Okorocha to help us get justice.” Command spokesman SP Benjamin Hundeyin said yesterday, “The policeman has not been arrested because he ran away. He has been identified. He is one of us at the state command headquarters. “We expect him to turn himself in.”
