Genk sports director Dmitri De Conde has revealed that they have given Eredivisie side Feyenoord till June 1st to decide if they want to sign Nigerian international Cyriel Dessers permanently. Dessers left Cegeka Arena for De Kuip temporarily in search of playing time. After a rough start in the Netherlands, the Nigerian striker picked form, showing his prowess in the league and on the continent. Despite being used as a substitute most times, the Genk loanee has rattled the net 15 times in 33 appearances. However, most of those strikes have been in the Europa Conference League. The Nigeria international is the joint highest goalscorer in the Conference League.

Nonetheless, they would have to hasten up their decision, as Genk want Feyenoord to make their decision before June 1. “Whether we see Dessers in a Genk shirt next season depends on Feyenoord,” Dmitri said as per Voetbalkrant. “They have until June 1 to put the option in the contract. If they don’t, then it is certainly an option to let Dessers make a new start here. “I’ve always said that he will always and everywhere be good for 15 goals.” Onuachu could leave Genk this summer, and with the shortage of proper marksmen at Cegeka Arena, Desser could decide to give Genk a second shot when his time at Feyenoord expires.
