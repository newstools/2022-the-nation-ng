Talented DJ, Exprezioni has shared accolades for the globalization of Afrobeat by Nigerian artistes. He said that over the past decade, a new breed of Nigerian stars, like Davido, Wizkid, Niniola, Burna Boy, et al have seen their Afrobeats music win admirers far beyond Nigeria’s border. Unlike the politically driven tune by the legendary Fela Kuti, this new wave of artistes have pulled glorious strings into making Afrobeat more than a sound! The likes of Wizkid, Davido have sold out concerts nationally and internationally – O2 Arena amongst others. “For a fact, the global acceptance of Afrobeat has a lot to do with Nigerian artistes.   Five artists that may make history at 64th Grammys     Now Muzik takes over Sound Sultan’s estate     Academy announces presenters as 64th Grammy holds today   “It is indeed a term for the African sound, however, the stem roots of its global popularity can be traced through the hardworks of Nigerian artistes”, DJ Exprezioni said. Speaking further, he butressed his points by analysing the growing trends of international publishing deals. Afrobeats has made advances at some of the world’s most well-known record labels. Sony and Universal Music have both opened offices in Nigeria in the last two years, establishing publishing and distribution deals with a number of Afrobeats artists. “We can even see that many international publishing companies like Sony, RSA, Empire are targeting Nigerian artistes in Africa,” he exclaimed! “This simply shows our relevance towards the growth of this genre globally. More importantly, it stresses how much influence we have as a nation of musical talents”, he added.
