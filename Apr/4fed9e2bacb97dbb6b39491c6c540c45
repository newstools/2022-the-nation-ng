Princess Adu described the deceased as a mother in a million. She said: “Maami, like I usually call her, was a wonderful mother. Most times if you go to visit her, she was always praying. Honestly, I’m going to miss Maami, I’m going to miss her a lot. Last year before she took ill, during Ramadan period, I was in her house and discovered that she was fasting. I said, ‘Maami, you are still fasting even at this age,’ and she will tell me, I woke at 3:30am and after the Subr (morning) prayer, she will just sleep like one hour and she will continue praying, that is to tell you that she was always praying and that really reflected in everything that she was doing “I will miss her prayers and the linage appraisal; she would praise me to the point to the point whereby water will start dropping from my eyes… I wish her Al-Jannah Firdaus.”
