Popular actor Fredrick Leonard has advocated the non-use of deodorants and body spray be declared an offence punishable by law. The Anambra-born film star, sharing a post on his Instagram page, tackled persons who sweat profusely in the course of carrying out their daily activities yet neglect the use of deodorants or body sprays. Freddie argued such persons end up oozing when involved in tasks that require a lot of body movement thus, he recommended the use of deodorants/body sprays to forestall such.

Especially if your work is tedious and involves a lot of body movement, you will sweat and when you sweat, you stink,” he stated. Freddie added: “It’s not expensive. No matter how low you earn, you can afford it. Use the money you spend on calls to gossip and buy data to visit gossip blogs on social media to freshen up yourself and smell good. So you don’t kill your colleagues and co-workers. Thank you.” The 45-year-old media personality captioned the post: “TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN!”
