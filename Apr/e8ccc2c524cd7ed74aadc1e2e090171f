The resumed trial of the Indigenous People of Biafra(IPOB) leader Nnamdi Kanu Friday brought movement and activities in Imo State to a halt as markets, shops, schools, banks, filling stations all closed for business. The Nation’s correspondent, who monitored the situation, reports the compliance was visible in all the 27 Local Government Areas of Imo State with the council’s headquarters completely deserted by workers. In Owerri, the state capital, roads/streets and the usually boisterous high brow axis of Ikenegbu, Aladinma, works layout, Prefab, World Bank and the Area “H”, all wore the ugly picture of a ghost town.

Also, commercial buses were few on the road with no passengers boarding the few available buses. Our correspondent also sighted armed mobile policemen in their vehicles at strategic junctions adjacent the Government House roundabout, Bank Road and the Nigerian Correctional Centres as they incessantly patrolled the empty roads. As at the time of filling this report, all motor parks in Owerri were literally converted into fields by youths who freely played balls on them. Frustrated residents of the city especially those on essential services were seen trekking long distances to get to their destinations.
