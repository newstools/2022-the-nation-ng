Controversial Ghanaian reggae-dancehall artist, Charles Nii Armah Mensah Jr aka Shatta Wale has adjudged his country music shameful. The rap star, in a social media post, appealed to his colleagues to cease the comparison between Ghanaian and Nigerian music acts. According to Shatta Wale, Nigerian artistes are hardworking compared to their Ghanaian counterparts whom he described as lazy.
