During the event at his Abuja mansion, the popular hotelier pledged to support 20 of his ex-classmates with N2million each while also calling on others who are financially buoyant to join the course. Obi Cubana further proposed a trust fund to that effect. He said: “Life is not just about taking pictures and posting on Instagram. I mean, many people think that we have made it in life. People are going through hell and to the glory of God, some of us, God has actually blessed us.
