As of the time of filing this report, the passenger was still going through interrogation at the immigration office at the airport and would be handed over to the appropriate authorities for further questioning. The source said: “Officials of the Nigeria Immigration Service actually intercepted the passenger with the firearms during screening. So far, the passenger is undergoing scrutiny from the officials of the service and will be handed over to the relevant authorities after interrogation. “Besides, we learnt that the passenger with dual citizenship has the approval of the US Government to carry firearms but such should have been declared at the port of entry, which he didn’t do. However, we are yet to verify the documents he’s carrying.”
