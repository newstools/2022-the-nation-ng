Everyday is Earth’s Earth is everyday’s   But this day is the day Of the bell and the gong Of solemn awakenings And the hurt which comes before the herb   Wounded trees bleed in the forest Lynched lakes congeal like rancid potions A poisoned sea foams At the edge of a million mouths   Who dare forget The day the River caught fire And the Mountain lay crushed Like a mound of hapless cake   Yellow rains, crimson dew, Broiling winters, freezing summers A perforated sky leaks red tears   SNAPSONG 154     SNAPSONG 153     LET’S DO THE SING-ALONG   Into the basin of thinning rivers   A tropical madness unclothes the streets New-born babies surprise the cradle With double heads.
