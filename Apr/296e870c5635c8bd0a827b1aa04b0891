Barely 24 hours after a Federal High Court in Abuja ruled that government must implement the 35 per cent affirmative action for women, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has declared free nomination forms for women aspirants for all elective offices in the 2023 general election. But they are to pay the prescribed fees for expression of interest forms. The nomination waiver covers all women aspirants vying for the party’s tickets to contest state and national assemblies, governorship and presidential seats. Women aspirants in the ruling party had hitherto enjoyed a 50 per cent discount for expression of interest and nomination forms. APC National Women Leader, Dr. Betta Edu, spoke yesterday at the party’s national secretariat in Abuja.

She urged Nigerian women to come to the ruling party to benefit from the gesture.
