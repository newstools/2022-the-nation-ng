After spinning several heart-stirring melodies for several years, Afro-folk chanteuse Blessing Tangban has returned with an EP entitled ‘Out Of The Ordinary Feel.’ The 5-track project sees the Cross River native row across ancient waters as she serves intriguing Afro-folk melodies bathed in her hometown Ejagham lingo.   Cinema exhibitors announce movies to showcase during Easter     I’m about to build ‘craziest crib ever’-…     Davido sets to develop gift land from dad   Tangban, who has just bagged her doctorate in public policy administration, explains the inspiration behind the album: “I feel that we have little to no representation for our people and our culture. So, with my music, I’m bringing back the culture. “With the EP, I am basically trying to share the creativity that is out of the ordinary. This is why songs like Sir’m and Fibiyin were meant to go a certain genre, but I had to put my twist on it. You can’t explain them. One of the songs, Sir’m was born out of really intense heartbreak. The kind of heartbreak songs that you cannot express in English. It was a complex situation. Fibiyin was born of something similar. I think love is the only thing that touches my heart. Everything else is just mundane. Other songs like Blessings and The Beat, and Africa are a bit different.” Popular for her viral hit with the love maestro Johnny Drille, ‘Grow Up,’ Tangban’s foray across the music scene started at the turn of the 2010s, just as the flame of Afro-folk music already started to dim in the country.
