What is going on here is not right, the country is lost and we don’t have to wait until we become totally helpless before it is time to truly speak up. This country can’t end like this, we are giants. I hope we are still right about that, we are supposed to be giants of Africa, let the fighters in us get up,” she said. The star actress further charged for all to demand good governance moving forward. “Let us demand responsible governance, let us demand equity, judgment and fairness, let us demand and put an end to this obnoxious constitution that is nothing but to be thrown away so we can have a better constitution.”
