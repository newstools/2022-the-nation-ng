On an afternoon when Manchester United needed an antidote to growing toxicity both inside and outside the ground Cristiano Ronaldo stepped up. Despite his reputation, the five-time Ballon d’Or winner rarely scores from free-kicks, so when his 25-yard drive flew into the Norwich City goal to seal his second hat-trick in successive home league appearances, the roof came off Old Trafford. His treble sealed a crucial 3-2 win for the Red Devils, which in turn stopped their season from entering total meltdown – at least for now. United’s supporters had made themselves clear ahead of kick-off who they believe the problem is at the club.   Chelsea beat Crystal Palace to reach FA Cup final     Guardiola defends team selection after Manchester City’s FA…     Spurs shocked 1-0 at home by Brighton   Thousands protested against the club’s ownership outside Old Trafford, but those behind the march – who took the decision to boycott the first 17 minutes of the game is a representation of the 17 years of Glazers ownership – made it clear that this is not just about the owners anymore. There have been so many abject performances this term that the fans’ have turned their anger towards the club’s underperforming players. A statement from an anonymous fan group associated with the protest said, “it’s long past time for these obscene-wage thieves to deliver so, as with the Glazers, they need to get out of the club.” Paul Pogba was booed off the pitch when he was replaced by Marcus Rashford, with a chorus of ‘F*ck off Pogba’ following from some of those sat in the Stretford End. Another three goals take him to 21 goals in all competitions this season, as he reached the 20-goal mark for the 16th consecutive season.
