Airtel Nigeria has been granted a full super-agent licence by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). This is coming six months after the telecoms firm announced that it had secured the licence-in-principle. In a statement entitled: “Nigeria Super-Agent Full Licence Approval” signed by Simon O’Hara, the Company Secretary means Airtel has a full super-agent licence to operate as an agency network.

The super-agent licence is distinct from the Payment Service Bank (PSB) licence for which MTN received approval in principle on November 4, 2021. The statement filed with the NGX reads: “Further to our announcement of 15 November 2021, Airtel Africa, a leading provider of telecommunications and mobile money services, with a presence in 14 countries across Africa, today confirms that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has awarded its subsidiary, Airtel Mobile Commerce Nigeria Limited, with a full super-agent licence.” The company, in the statement, did not specify when operations would resume, but, however, stated: “The licence allows us to create an agency network that can service the customers of licenced banks, payment service banks and licenced mobile money operators in Nigeria.”
