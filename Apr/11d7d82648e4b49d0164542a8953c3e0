Germany defender Antonio Rüdiger will leave Chelsea at the end of the season after turning down the offer of a new contract, manager Thomas Tuchel confirmed on Sunday. “The situation is that he wants to leave the club,” Tuchel said after their 1-0 English Premier League (EPL) win over West Ham. “He informed me of this in a private talk. “It is disappointing. We will miss him a lot.” The 29-year-old Rüdiger was reportedly offered record terms for a defender from Chelsea.

Media reports say Rüdiger’s team have been discussing potential moves with top clubs such as Real Madrid, FC Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) and Juventus. Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich could also be interested in him as a replacement for the departing Niklas Süle.(dpa/NAN)
