Liverpool moved top of the Premier League as they outclassed Manchester United at Anfield and dented the visitors’ hopes of a top-four finish. Liverpool, who started a point behind Manchester City, led when Luis Diaz stroked in Mohamed Salah’s low cross. The home side continued to dominate and Salah slotted in a deserved second from Sadio Mane’s reverse pass.

After their 5-0 win at Old Trafford in October, Liverpool are the first club to score at least eight Premier League goals against United in a single season. The victory moves Jurgen Klopp’s side two points clear of defending champions City, who have seven matches left to play and can regain top spot when they face Brighton on Wednesday. United, who could have moved level on points with fourth-placed Tottenham, remain sixth. On Saturday, the Red Devils go to fifth-placed Arsenal.
