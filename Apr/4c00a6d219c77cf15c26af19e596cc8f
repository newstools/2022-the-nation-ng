Award-winning Davido has explained why he has been seemingly unaccepted as a successful singer. He said he is not seen as a successful singer because of his wealthy family background. The DMW boss, in a chat on “IONWANNATALK” podcast, said the fact that he lacks the “grass to grace” story which is one significant criterion to be accepted by Nigerians makes it harder for him to be appreciated despite his impact on the Africa/global music scene. Davido also alleged envy in the music scene which is why although he was born with a golden spoon he has strived much harder than the common man yet his value is still being downplayed.

Let’s just be honest….A child from where I come from, hustled, suffered. “I can tell you that I’ve suffered more than a lot of people that don’t have money. And I’ve been able to build what I built. It’s not going to happen in a long time. “I don’t have the grass to grace story. And for Nigerians to accept you without that is usually very hard. “That’s why I’m asking you because I know…..I don’t think there’s anything the industry needs because it’s always going to be the same thing. There’s always going to be envy.”
