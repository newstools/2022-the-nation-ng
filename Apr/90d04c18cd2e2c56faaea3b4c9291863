Kano State Government has provided N550 million worth of food stuff and other items for a free feeding programme during the Ramadan period. The free feeding programme was introduced by Governor Umar Ganduje when he first became governor in 2015 and has been sustained as a traditional way of reducing the hardship that usually confronts the poor during Ramadan. Acting Governor Nasiru Yusuf Gawuna made this known when he inaugurated the programme for the 140 centres across the eight metropolitan local government areas. “The purpose of this programme, which has been a tradition and sustained since 2015 by the Ganduje administration, is to reduce hardship faced by the less privileged so as to enable them conduct Ramadan fasting with comfort and ease,” Gawuna said.
