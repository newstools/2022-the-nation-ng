GOSPEL musician and songwriter, Agbani Horsfall, has set up her own gospel studio, Uniq Music World in Abuja. According to Horsfall, the studio is the first gospel Karaoke in Abuja with state-of-the-art equipment which is primarily set up for gospel music both for renowned and young and up-coming gospel artists. Agbani hinted that it is only by the grace of God that she was able to set up the state-of-the-art studio and with the support of her husband and money from her other businesses that she is engaged in and hopes to replicate the studio in other states. “ The studio is spacious and accommodates any gospel activity and some side attractions include Gospel and Chill hangout every Tuesday and Thursday where gospel enthusiasts can come there to play games and sing gospel Karaoke, which is amazing.

Agbani Horsfall, whose songs are making waves, reveals that she built the studio because of the need for such studios. “I did this because of the need to sell out the gospel in everything that we do even in our business ventures and the dire need because there are literally none like this that is for strictly gospel,” she said. Agbani disclosed that she has performed with several gospel acts and always needed the extra comfort, hence, the berth of the new studio. “ I have performed with renowned gospel musicians like Panam Percy Paul, Dunsin Oyekan, Emmanuel Prince Onyegbula aka Emma Onyx, Ada Ogochukwu Ehi aka Ada Ehi, Gift Ugochi Godspower aka GUC among others, and planning to do some duet with them,” she said.
