Gabriel Jesus restored City’s advantage before the break but Sadio Mane marked his 30th birthday with a second equaliser for Jurgen Klopp’s men.

We couldn’t do that but we didn’t lose. It’s not the end of the world, we are still in the race, so positives and negatives. “I think we started OK but we were a little hectic at times. Of course, we knew we would come under pressure early on, they are a fantastic team. I felt we settled down a bit and caused them problems. It’s pleasing how we twice came from behind. We want to do better of couafte “You have to keep going, you have to be prepared to suffer. You have to stay positive, stay on the front foot, and not give them time. It worked at times, at others we can defend better.” Manchester City’s Kevin de Bruyne speaking to Sky Sports: “It was hard. To be fair I think we played excellently. The way we played was very good and we should score more. It is what it is. It was a great game.”
