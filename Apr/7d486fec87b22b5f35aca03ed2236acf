The posters of former President Goodluck Jonathan have adorned the national secretariat of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abuja. The posters, with a big picture of the ex- President in his Southsouth attire and a bowler hat with the inscription: “Goodluck Jonathan You Must Run”, are occupying a conspicuous position on the wall of the party secretariat. Our correspondent also noticed the posters on the fence of many buildings, especially the uncompleted ones at Blantyre Street where the APC secretariat is located.

It will be recalled that the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), along with some APC governors, paid a courtesy visit to the former president, fuelling suspicion of moves to woo Jonathan to the party. The committee was alleged to have muted the idea of dragging the ex-President to come and contest the 2023 presidential election on the platform of the APC. The allegation was refuted by the defunct CECPC. The committee said the then CECPC chairman and the governors only paid a courtesy visit to the elder statesman.
