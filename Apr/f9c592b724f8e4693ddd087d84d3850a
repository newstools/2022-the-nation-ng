The Professionals’ Council of All Progressives Congress (APC) has urged the party’s elected national officials to be magnanimous in victory and rise up to their responsibilities. A congratulatory letter by its Director-General, Seyi Bamgbade, urged them to ‘mend broken walls and bridges for the good of the party ahead of the 2023 election’. It hailed Senator Abdullahi Adamu on his election as the party’s national chairman, as well as other officials. Bamgbade described Adamu’s consensus win as historic, maintaining that his achievements as chair of the reconciliation committee were still fresh in mind.

The council noted that the Adamu-led executive at this critical political era is  a perfect match, and hoped that Adamu’s leadership would enrich the party with his antecedent as an astute administrator. “APC  Professionals Council calls on anyone who might be aggrieved from the fallout of the exercise to give peace a chance and prioritise the greater good of the party. ‘’Such persons should toe the reconciliation process to resolve any differences within the internal democratic machinery embedded in the party’s constitution and laws, rather than causing avoidable crisis as history would not forget,”he said.
