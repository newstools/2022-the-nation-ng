NIGERIANS have been called upon to help the federal government in the fight against bandits and insurgents by exposing the criminals living in their neighborhoods. Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed made the call during a Bond FM Radio programme in Lagos on Saturday. He noted that the investment by the incumbent government in tackling insecurity would be more impactful and more successful if the citizens on their part would not harbor the criminals living in their neighborhoods. “We are also pleading with Nigerians to join in this fight because they have a lot of role to play in tackling this insecurity.   Vandalisation of power lines caused electricity grid…     EFCC challenges court order to release Obiano’s…     Auto crash: Jonathan visits injured police officer in…   “This is because these criminals called bandits are living among us; they interact with the people as well. Who are the ones supplying them foods, more so they also have landlords? “People should expose these criminals and then, the various efforts of the government will be effectively complemented and we will see the results,” he said. Mohammed said that the government had invested heavily in security to keep the country safe, adding that government would not rest until lives and property of Nigerians are fully secured. “We have been trying our best in the fight against the bandits by equipping all our security apparatus, the government has purchased aircraft so that they can fight alongside the soldiers.
