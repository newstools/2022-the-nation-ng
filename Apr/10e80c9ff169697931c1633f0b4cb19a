Nigerians, especially   politicians, have been called upon  to allow  the will of God prevail in their activities. A non-denominational group, The Christian Conscience,  made the call at the weekend. It said there was still hope for a better Nigeria. Rising from a meeting after a deliberation and spiritual exercise on national matters, the group said there was still hope  provided that political leaders make God the corner stone in their activities and submit to the His Will. “Simply put, doing all things with the fear of God, being considerate to fellow human beings in all things,” it said of what is expected of leaders.   ‘I’ll ensure my constituents’ well-being’     PEBEC extends 7th National Action by 30 days     School meals in Nigeria, India: comparing two approaches   The group’s position was contained in a statement  by its National Chairman, Dr Mrs Yetunde Akinluyi and  National General Secretary, Revd  Kolawole Verrals  in Lagos. Citing the power of Resurrection of Jesus Christ, the group said:  “We must have hope where there seems to be none because the death and the  resurrection of Jesus Christ has given us Hope against all odds”. Rejoicing with all Christain faithful and those alive for this year’s Easter Celebrations, the group  admonished all Nigerians not to give up hope despite the various challenges facing the nation but trust in the Almighty God who is sufficient and efficient in all matters of humanity. “Our political leaders need prayers more than before, the power of the  devil  cannot be compared with the power of God as He is capable of defeating darkness at all times if we, as a Nation genuiely seek His face without pretence’’, the group said.. The group encouraged eligible voters to take advantage of the ongoing continuous voters’ registration to update their card.
