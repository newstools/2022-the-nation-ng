Led in evidence by prosecuting counsel, Sylvester Azubike, the witness said she received a call from Oando about a reduction in her company’s capital and asking her to recapitalise. The businesswoman told the court that Emmanuel, her former filling station manager, allegedly connived with others to steal funds from daily sales running into millions of naira rather than remitting them to the company’s account. Emmanuel, Akeem, Michael and Samson pleaded not guilty. Justice Coker adjourned the case until February 15.
