All the same, Reno encouraged the “hellfire” preacher to have a swell time in Dubai but should avoid hell while at it. He wrote: “That Mommy GO video in Dubai where she was excited like a teenager vindicates what I said last year. Religion thrives in Nigeria because of suffering. “When you relocate abroad, those things you fast and pray for now seem so elementary, and your mind is able to be free of the religious delusions that previously held you in bondage! “Who would ever have believed that Mummy GO will be prancing around a hotel suite in a bathing robe and showing off, like a #BBNaija housemate? “The old Mummy GO would have declared such ‘worldly’ behaviour as a ticket straight to hell. “Enjoy Dubai Funmi but make sure you avoid hell.”
