Football lovers in Lagos have commended Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu administrations for erecting free viewing centres across the state. The initiative, “Lagos is a Goal”, is packaged by the Governor through the Lagos State Sports Commission (LSSC), to bring all the matches at the 33rd African biennial showpiece in Cameroon live for people of Lagos to relax and enjoy themselves. One of the football lovers at the Teslim Balogun Stadium viewing centre, Robinson Mpaeru, said he was glad about the government’s gesture. “This is my first time of coming across this kind of thing (viewing centre), whereby a lot of people come around and feel the vibes of all Nigerian perspectives.” “I give kudos to Gov. Sanwo-Olu for the venue created for us to also feel at home and share the joy of Nigerian football while in the country,” Mpaeru said.
