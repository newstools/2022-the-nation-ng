Novak Djokovic was deported from Australia yesterday having lost a high-stakes legal battle over his coronavirus vaccination status and with his dream of clinching a record 21st Grand Slam in tatters. Hours after a Federal Court unanimously upheld the cancellation of his visa on public order grounds, an “extremely disappointed” Djokovic complied with a direction to leave the country. The humbled star boarded a flight from Melbourne’s Tullamarine airport for Dubai late Sunday, accompanied by a retinue of aides and officials. Emirates flight EK409 took off at 10:51 pm local time (1151 GMT), according to an AFP reporter on board. Twice in the last 11 days Australia’s government had ripped up Djokovic’s visa and placed him in immigration detention – saying the unvaccinated star’s presence could fuel anti-vaccine sentiment amid a tidal wave of Omicron cases.

With a few dry words, the chief justice of Australia’s Federal Court, James Allsop, ended a week of legal high drama that was followed around the world.  “The orders of the court are that the amended application be dismissed with costs,” Allsop said. With little chance for appeal, Djokovic acknowledged the game was up, and he would not be gracing Melbourne Park this year.  “I cannot stay in Australia and participate in the Australian Open,” he said on the eve of a tournament that he has dominated for a decade. “I hope that we can all now focus on the game and tournament I love.”
