Former governor of Zamfara State, Alhaji Abdulaziz Yari, on Thursday night had a meeting with former Vice President Atiku Abubakar and former Senate President, Bukola Saraki.  Also at the meeting was Senator Kabiru Marafa who represented Zamfara Central in the Eighth Senate.  Yari and Marafa presently lead two different factions in the Zamfara Chapter of the APC.  Atiku and Saraki are among the eight contenders for the 2023 presidential ticket of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).  Although details of the meeting, which took place at Saraki’s Maitama, Abuja, residence were not made public, inside sources said it may not be unconnected with the  rumoured  defection plan of the two APC chieftains. - Advertisement -  The two APC chieftains had, a few weeks ago, had a similar meeting with Saraki, which Marafa later said was only a social interaction.
