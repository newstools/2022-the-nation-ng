Christian Eriksen’s return to football is complete, as he has completed a deadline day move to Premier League side Brentford. According to Romano, Brentford have completed the signing of Eriksen on a six-month deal with option to extend until June 2023. The 29-year-old had to pass a series of medical assessments to ensure he is fit to play again after having been fitted with an internal defibrillator as a result of his cardiac arrest during Denmark’s match against Finland at Euro 2020. Eriksen has put pen to paper on a short-term deal until the end of the season, but he won’t join up with the Brentford squad this week. He has only recently received his COVID-19 vaccination while training with Ajax in the Netherlands, so he needs to quarantine for a few days before travelling to England. - Advertisement -   A’Ibom 2023: Gov Emmanuel endorses Umo Eno as successor     Tinubu consults with APC UK leader, others     Oba-elect donates billboard, vehicles for Tinubu’s…   Brentford manager Thomas Frank has managed Eriksen before, back when he was in the Denmark under-17s setup, and he is looking forward to reuniting with the 29-year-old. “I am looking forward to working with Christian again,” Frank said. “It has been a while since I last coached him, and a lot has happened since then. Christian was 16 at the time and has become one of the best midfield players to appear in the Premier League. “He has also won trophies all over Europe and become the star of the Danish national team. “We have taken an unbelievable opportunity to bring a world-class player to Brentford. He hasn’t trained with a team for seven months but has done a lot of work on his own. “He is fit but we will need to get him match fit and I am looking forward to seeing him work with the players and staff to get back towards his highest level.” This will be Eriksen’s second spell in England, as he played for Tottenham Hotspur for six and a half seasons before joining Inter in January 2020.
