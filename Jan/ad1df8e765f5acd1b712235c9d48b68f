Nollywood veteran Ugezu J. Ugezu has recommended to his fans and followers the adoption of silence as an antidote to social media attacks and trolls. According to Ugezu, online attacks are usually from two sets of people: close friends utilising faceless accounts and jobless individuals, already defeated, but wallowing in pitiable jealousy. The thespian who maintains a classy Highlife music band called Ayaka Enugwu-Ukwu while highlighting the beauty of ‘silence’ in such situations noted it indeed has a ‘golden voice’ which speaks volume although no words have been uttered. “1. Many, if not all those faceless accounts that attack you online belong to your close friends. IGNORE,” he wrote. “2. All those accounts travelling the streets of social media mentioning your name to ridicule you are jobless individuals, already defeated, but wallowing in pitiable Jealousy.”   Don’t marry if you aren’t a millionaire, Joro Olumofin…     Every man wants me, says BBNaija’s Maria     Doctors said I wouldn’t make it past 2020, says Uche Ogbodo   - Advertisement - Mr. Surplus, as he is also known in Nollywood, continued: “Silence has a voice, a golden voice.
