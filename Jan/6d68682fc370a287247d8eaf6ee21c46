Mavin Records boss Don Jazzy has advised men to intentionally learn the act of ‘toasting’ women in the New Year. The music producer, in a video shared on his Instagram page, could be heard enlightening men on why they must learn and become ‘pros’ in wooing contemporary women. According to Jazzy, a man’s money can longer be used as a tool in luring today’s women because they are now richer. This, he said, is why every man including himself must learn other ways aside utilising money to win the hearts of women in 2022.
