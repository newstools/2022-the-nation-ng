Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Monday said the events in Kazakhstan had made it clear that social networks do both good and evil. According to him, their negative impact must be stopped. “Obviously, social networks, apart from the good, also do evil. The aim is to take measures to stop this evil. This story is not new, it is old. It just found its obvious relevance once again in the course of recent events in Kazakhstan.’’ Asked if the Russian government plans to introduce any social media regulations given Kazakhstan’s experience, Peskov replied “there is nothing like that right now.” Mass protests in Kazakhstan began in the early days of 2022, with residents of the western cities of Zhanaozen and Aktau protesting a twofold increase in the price of liquefied gas. - Advertisement -   7,939 people detained during unrest in Kazakhstan     U.S., Russia meet in Geneva to discuss Ukraine crisis     British royals reveal 4-day programme to celebrate 70-year…   The protests spilled over to other cities, including the former capital and largest city of Almaty, where looting, attacks on government buildings, and armed clashes with the police broke out. In response, the Kazakh authorities declared a nationwide state of emergency until January 19, and launched an anti-terrorist operation. Almost 1,000 people were injured during the unrest, according to the United Nations. On Wednesday, President of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev dismissed the government and took over the Security Council, describing the situation in Kazakhstan as undermining national integrity. He officially requested the assistance of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation in “overcoming the terrorist threat,’’ which then sent collective peacekeeping forces to Kazakhstan to normalise the situation. On Friday, Tokayev said that terrorists, which include foreigners, were stoking the insurgency, and vowed to eliminate those who would not lay down their arms. (Sputnik/NAN)
