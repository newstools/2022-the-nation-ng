Multiple award-winning actress Eniola Badmus has joined several admirers to gush over her new body following her weight loss transformation. In July 2021, Badmus in an interview had revealed plans to embark on a weight loss journey. Badmus said: “I didn’t initially decide to go on a weight loss journey; it chose me. It all started when I put up a post a while back about weight loss companies using slim people to promote their products and services. “I told them to use me if truly their products work. A lot of them picked up the challenge but I was able to settle with one. I decided to work with them because I like their plan and I hope it would work.”   Olamide ‘Baddo’ under fire for dissing fan’s mother     P-Square to release first song after five-year separation     S3x- for-role claims in Nollywood untrue – Kanayo O Kanayo   - Advertisement - She added: “In fairness, I really can’t tell if losing weight would help my brand because with or without losing weight, I’m Eniola Badmus. If this works, people would just see the new body on me. “However, it’s not going to be a total transformation because I still want to be a chubby girl; not slim. “The goal is to be chubby but sexier. Maybe like losing three sizes. People should not think that I would be a shadow of who they know. I’m only doing this because I want to.” In a recent post on her Instagram page, ‘Senator badosky’ while urging her fans and followers to be partakers of the process that has birthed her new look revealed she now enjoys profuse attention that leaves her feeling like a new born baby. “The attention I get now is quite overwhelming feels like I’m a new born baby it’s a new life for me and a new journey.
