The Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) has warned some petroleum tanker drivers to stop meddling in the association’s affairs, especially with regards to its national leadership. Alhaji Yakubu Suleiman, Public Relations Officer, IPMAN, made this known in a statement issued on Monday in Lagos. Yakubu said the current National Executive Committee (NEC) of IPMAN had received information that some tanker drivers were behind ongoing plans to install another leadership for IPMAN on Jan. 18. He said the move was a flagrant violation of the judgment delivered by the Supreme Court in Abuja on Dec. 14, 2018. Yakubu said the judgment read by Justice Musa Muhammad in suit No. SC15/2015, recognised Mr Chinedu Okoronkwo and Alhaji Danladi Pasali, as President and Secretary of IPMAN, respectively. - Advertisement -   Fed Govt to raise N471b from capital market in first quarter     5G: Subscribers to pay more     Naira declines amid devaluation concerns   He said the tenure of the executive would expire on Dec. 14, 2023. Yakubu added that IPMAN had already zoned the next president of the association to the Northwest. “Any attempt to install another set of persons as NEC of IPMAN is null and void because the matter has been settled by the Supreme Court which is the final arbiter of justice in Nigeria. “The Attorney General of the Federation, Mr Abubakar Malami, and the Inspector General of Police, Mr Usman Baba, have already directed that the judgment must be complied with. “We are, therefore, calling on the security agencies to investigate this issue and apprehend those behind the move to forestall breakdown of law and order.
