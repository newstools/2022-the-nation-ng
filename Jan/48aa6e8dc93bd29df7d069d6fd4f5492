OUT-of-favour Barcelona midfielder Philippe Coutinho is reportedly open to moving to Brazil during the January transfer window to revive his career. According to a report from UOL, Philippe Coutinho is ready to leave Barcelona and move to Brazil in the upcoming January transfer window as he looks to get his career back on track. Coutinho joined Barcelona in January 2018, arriving from Liverpool in a club-record deal worth £142 million. Nearly four years after his move to Camp Nou, it would be safe to say that the Brazilian playmaker has been a major flop at Camp Nou. Apart from a bright spell in his first six months at the club, the 29-year-old has massively struggled to make a mark.
