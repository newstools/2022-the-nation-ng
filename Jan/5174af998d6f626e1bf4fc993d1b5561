Senator Nicholas Tofowomo (Ondo South) has said that he would rather quit politics than leave the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to join the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Tofowomo, who described himself as a senator not desperate for money, said he would never leave the PDP to join a party that ‘ruined’ the country’s economy. Tofowo spoke at Ile-Oluji, Ondo State, where he presented laptops to members of his constituents after a training programme on Information and Communication Technology. The Ondo PDP Senator, who scored Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu high on road construction, said the unemployment rate in the State was on the high side.   Why I’ve ventured into partisan politics –…     Emmanuel asks former aspirants to support Ekiti PDP…     ‘Nigeria needs a leader like Jonathan’   He said there were sectors Governor Akeredolu did well but had not performed to the expectations of the people. - Advertisement - His words: “I will leave politics than joining APC. APC is dead in the country and the party ruined the economy. If I leave the PDP, I am going back home. Things are so bad in this country now. It is an insult for me to go to the APC. APC has failed in all sectors. APC has failed the Nation. It does not have an agenda. “I will make the PDP happy in Ondo South. I will never ever decamp. My activities have finished the APC in Ondo South. Do not believe in rumour. I will not decamp. On his rating of Governor Akeredolu, he said: “There are some areas Akeredolu did well, there are some areas he failed. In employment, he failed because there are no jobs. He tried in road construction but I only give them 25 percent overall performance.”
