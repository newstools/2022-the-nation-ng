Peter Olayinka has vowed to replicate the spectacular goals he scored in training if he is given a chance to make his Africa Cup of Nations debut against Guinea-Bissau. There are indications that the Slavia Prague winger will be involved in some capacity against Guinea-Bissau after he was left out of the matchday 23 against Egypt and Sudan. The 26-year-old is competing with Taiwo Awoniyi, Umar Sadiq and Kelechi Iheanacho for a starting spot in the attack against the African wild dog. “I am still waiting till Wednesday to be sure if I am going to play. If I have the opportunity to play, like I always say I am going to give my best,” Olayinka said after training.
