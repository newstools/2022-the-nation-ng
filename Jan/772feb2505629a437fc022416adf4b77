Since we couldn’t find the herders, we came with the cows to the office. ” We are sure that they will come over soonest because the anti-open grazing law is still on the ground and has been enforced. It is forbidden for the cows to graze at night and for the underage to control. “These are all the provisions that are on the ground and of course, the law will take its course. In the last three months, we have been on public enlightenment for the herders and farmers. ”So, once the farmers and herders understand the limitation of each other, there’ll be no problem. There will always be rainy and dry seasons. We are reverting back to the days that farmers can confidently go to their farms to take crops and nothing will happen to them.”
