Abiodun Williams, counsel for Dr Ramon Adedoyin, owner of Hilton Hotel and Resorts, has questioned the claims that Close Circuit Television (CCTV) footage of the hotel revealed the identities of those involved in the alleged murder of a Masters Degree student, Timothy Adegoke. Williams, in a statement on Sunday, challenged anyone who has such footage to submit it to the police. He urged the public to disregard the claim that Chief Adedoyin, his son and other staff murdered the MBA student. He said: “The police have not released any official statement on the outcome of their investigations so far.
