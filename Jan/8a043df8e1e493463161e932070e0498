Controller of the Federal Operations Unit Zone ‘A’ of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Lagos, Hussein Kehinde Ejibunu has said there is a need for new warehouses to be built at the Ikeja office of the Customs Service. At a recent briefing, Ejibunu spoke emphatically of the need to have another expansive warehouse, noting that his men were ready to ensure strict compliance to extant laws and therefore, will not bend the rules in seizing goods that duties were not adequately paid. According to him, this is a result of the lack of space currently at the existing warehouse to accommodate several thousands of seizures made by the Unit in recent times.

No fewer than 30,000 bags of foreign parboiled rice have been intercepted in the last three months in addition to about 60,000 bags already kept at the federal operations unit, congesting the warehouse. - Advertisement - Apart from some seized edible products like rice, tomato, and spaghetti given to the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) at their camps in the northern part of the country, there is presently no other way of decongesting the place.. It was learnt that most of the auctioned goods especially vehicles which were sold through the electronic auction system, which, stakeholders have described as cumbersome, are lying unclaimed, thereby complicating the already worrisome space constraint.
