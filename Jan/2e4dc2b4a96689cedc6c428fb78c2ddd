Super Eagles and Napoli striker Victor Osimhen has been tipped to return to action on January 16 when Napoli face Bologna in the Serie A. The former Lille forward was ruled out of the upcoming African Cup Nations after Napoli confirmed that he had tested positive for Covid-19 last week and was replaced by Olympiacos forward Henry Onyekuru by interim coach Augustine Eguavoen. Before testing positive for Covid-19, the 23-year-old was recovering from a nasty face injury which he sustained in Napoli’s Serie A clash against Inter Milan on November 21 2021. Because of this, he was initially ruled out for two to three months. Also, the Partenopei were against Osimhen’s invitation to the Nations Cup, stating his injury as a reason to hold him. However, Napoli magazine, as per La Gazzetta Dello Sport, reports that Osimhen could return in January, although his minutes will be limited.

Meanwhile, Slavia Prague forward Peter Olayinka cannot wait to don the Super Eagles jersey after being called up to join the Super Eagles squad. The 26-year-old attacker, who was in former coach Gernot Rohr’s 40-man provisional list but was excluded in Eguavoen’s 28-man final list for the tournament, was called to replace Emmanuel Dennis after Watford stopped the exciting attacker from honouring national team duty. “I am really excited; it’s a dream come true for me,” Olayinka told Slavia’s official website. “I am really looking forward to the tournament; I can’t wait to give it my all.”
