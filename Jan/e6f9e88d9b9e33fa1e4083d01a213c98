The Oshoja royal family of Ikeja has announced 33-year-old Temitope Ibikunle as a candidate for the Olu of Ikeja stool. The family addressed a news conference to announce their choice. Prince Ibikunle was a youth representative on the now-defunct Lagos State Judicial Panel of Inquiry on Restitution for Victims of SARS-Related Abuses and other matters. Controversies trailed ascension to the throne when the Iyade ruling house crowned Muritala Tajudeen at the weekend. The government however denounced the kingship, saying it had not approved the process or the candidate. A statement by the family heads, Alhaja Taibat Adeleye, and Prince Muka Akinlabi, said the entire family unanimously agreed on Temitope Ibikunle as the next Olu of Ikeja because they couldn’t allow an impostor to take the throne.

He should be disregarded and arrested. We appeal to the entire Ikeja community not to have any dealings with him. “We also notify the Ikeja community and public that due to the long rivalry between our sons – Princes Nurudeen and Wasiu Adeleye – who were earlier nominated, have been asked to step aside. “This decision was reached after years of waiting and a series of appeal meetings to resolve the differences between them. Consequently, the family has unanimously withdrawn Princes Nurudeen and Wasiu in a formal communication to the Lagos State government.”
