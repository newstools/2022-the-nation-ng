Comedian-cum-actor, Basketmouth has reaffirmed his commitment to criticizing pastors despite warning from a renowned cleric. Bishop David Oyedepo of Living Faith Church recently warned Christians to desist from criticizing the prophets and ministries they belong to. The cleric noted speaking against men of God and ministries they represent can attract leprosy, adding many critics from his ministry have been victims of this warning which is based on spiritual insight. He said: “Beware of speaking hurt against the Ministry you claim to be part of advancing, it’s a risk. “Beware of speaking hurt against a Prophet you claim to believe. It is dangerous. It can make a man leprous. It is dangerous. We don’t have the data of how many victims may have come from this warning, but I know quite some would have been victims.

So it is not a problem. It is already written. It is not that it is something that is new,” he said. In reaction, the comic star admitted to being guilty of what the cleric warned against but will continue on that path nonetheless. Sharing a photo of the Oyedepo news via his Insta story, the comic star wrote: “This news dey make me laugh cos I am so guilty of this. “Did it again 7 times yesterday and 15 times today. And I know I have 50 more to go today.”
