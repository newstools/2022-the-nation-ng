The bet must include one Africa Cup of Nations 2021 event among other terms and conditions which are listed on the BetKing website. Gossy Ukanwoke, Managing Director, KingMakers, explained that “when you place a bet with little and get more, that’s the AFKON feeling, and that’s BetKing.” He also noted that the campaign incorporates the BetKing brand while paying homage to the football tournament, African football stars, and BetKing customers. “We have replaced the ‘C’ in AFCON with a ‘K’ in our campaign. This is a deliberate move to celebrate the tournament which is undoubtedly the ‘King of all tournaments in African football’ that showcases the biggest stars from around the continent who are the ‘Kings of African football,’ and we are rewarding the biggest supporters of the sport, our customers, who are ‘Kings,’” he added.
