The good thing was that the producers and directors recognised what had to be done to achieve this film so they put us in a space that helped us at Mokola barracks so I had to sort of coexist with the army wives, talk to them, share their experiences because that helped me get into character so for me, I think that discipline will help you understand that you have to keep growing your skill you just don’t rest on your laurels,” she submitted.
