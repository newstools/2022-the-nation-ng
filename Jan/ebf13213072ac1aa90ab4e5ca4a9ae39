Commenting on the report, Economist/CEO, Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise (CPPE), Dr Muda Yusuf, said inflationary pressures remain a significant macro-economic risk in the economy. He said it is a major concern to both businesses and the citizens as food inflation, which is the biggest worry for the poor, rose from 17.21 per cent in November to 17.37 per cent in December. Yusuf observed that the core inflation, which relates to non-agricultural products, maintained an upward trend as it increased from 13.85 per cent in November to 13.87 per cent in December. This was largely a reflection of the impact of currency depreciation and the liquidity challenges in the forex market. He said although the economy witnessed an incremental deceleration in inflation over the past eight months before the reversal in December, high inflationary pressures remain a major concern to stakeholders in the Nigerian economy. On the implications, the former Director General of Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) said: “It led to the escalation of production and operating costs for businesses, leading to erosion of profit margins, drop in sales, decline in turnover and weak manufacturing capacity utilization. “It also led to high food prices which impact adversely on citizens’ welfare and aggravates poverty, weak purchasing power which poses significant risk to business sustainability and price volatility which undermines investors’ confidence.” On major drivers of inflation and cost in the economy, Yusuf identified them as surge in consumer spending driven by the December festivities, exchange rate depreciation which has a significant impact on headline inflation, especially the core sub index, liquidity challenges in the foreign exchange market impacting adversely on manufacturing output and security concerns affecting agricultural output. Others, according to him, are climate change effects on agricultural production, increasing cases of flooding, desertification in many parts of the country and structural constraints affecting productivity in the agricultural value chain. ‘’High transportation costs affecting distribution costs across the country also reflected in the huge differential between farm gate prices and market prices. Monetization of fiscal deficit such as CBN financing of deficit is highly inflationary because of the liquidity injection effects on the economy. This becomes worrisome when statutory thresholds are exceeded”. Yusuf also said high transaction cost at the nation’s ports increases production and operating costs of businesses through high energy cost, high import duty on intermediate goods and raw materials. To tame inflation, he recommended the need for government to reform the foreign exchange market to stabilize the exchange rate and reduce volatility, address forex liquidity issues through appropriate policy measures and address the security concerns causing disruption to agricultural activities. Other measures he suggested included addressing productivity issues in the real sector of the economy, addressing the challenge of high transportation cost and reducing fiscal deficit financing by the CBN to minimize incidence of high-powered money in the economy. Yusuf also suggested the need to manage climate change consequences to reduce flooding and desertification, ensure the restoration of normalcy and good order at the nation’s ports to reduce transaction costs, reduce import duty on intermediate products and raw materials for industries to reduce production costs, especially in the light of the sharp depreciation in the exchange rate. Others are to address concerns around high energy cost and also create an investment friendly tax environment.
