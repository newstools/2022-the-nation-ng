Super Eagles goalkeeper Maduka Okoye was targeted with sick abuse and death threats following the team’s Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) round of 16 defeat to Tunisia on Sunday. The team were eliminated from the 33rd AFCON after the 22-year-old Sparta Rotterdam shot stopper could not keep out a shot from Carthage Eagle’s Youssef Msakni in the 47th minute. One message prayed that Maduka “no go see next month” adding that “na for plane crash you go die.” Another fan wrote “see your life, girls have ruined your career, no shot on target since the start of the Nations Cup, just this simple shot you couldn’t keep out.”   Gambia edge Guinea into quarter-finals     Simon tips Eagles for Qatar 2022 World Cup     Super Eagles back to Abuja   Meanwhile, richie.smile wrote:”Don’t let us see you in Nigeria again, mumu” as another comment from pelexoflagos01 said ” Maduka Okoye, God go punish you and your family, your incompetence cost us the AFCON.” - Advertisement - In the meantime, a cross section of Super Eagles fans have lent their support to the embattled German-born goalkeeper, reminding Nigerians that he is only 22-years-old and would only get better like most goalkeepers do. German-based football reporter Oma Akatugba tweeted: “Maduka Okoye is a young goalkeeper and conceded a goal many other goalkeepers concede, even the best goalkeepers as well. He is young and growing. No matter how you want to look at it, he is Nigeria’s best choice at the moment. He is a Watford goalkeeper. Let’s cut him some slack.” “Keep your head up Nwanne! At 22 years you have achieved what other keepers at your age never achieved! you still need time to mature and be on top of ur game! Don’t let anyone bring you down bro!” Don.iyke Ofokaire wrote.
