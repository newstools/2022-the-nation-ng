The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has released operational guidelines on the Global Service Instructions (GSI), aimed at checking the spate of bad loans within the banking sector. According to a statement by Chibuzo Efobi, for the Director, Financial Policy and Regulation Department of the apex bank, the initiative was conceived to address recurring instances of willful loan default in the industry. Efobi said that the guidelines would enhance the establishment of a “watch list” identify recalcitrant loan defaulters and enhance loan recovery from all eligible and funded accounts in the industry. He added that it would also improve credit payment culture and reduce non-performing loans in the Nigerian banking system.

He said that the GSI automated loan recovery feature applicable to all loans in the industry shall remain perpetually in place throughout the life of the loan, or until it is fully repaid. He urged members of the banking public to check the CBN website, www.cbn.gov.ng for the perusal of the guidelines. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the GSI initiative was approved by the Bankers’ Committee at its meeting in February 2020. The CBN, thereafter, collaborated with relevant stakeholders to develop necessary protocols to facilitate implementation of the GSI, for eligible loans granted with effect from Aug. 28, 2019. (NAN)
