A Federal High Court in Abuja has outlawed the practice where the Federal Government deducts funds directly from the Federation Account to fund the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) in line with Section 4(1)(a) & (b) of the Police Trust Fund (PTF) Act 2019. Justice Ahmed Mohammed, in a judgment on Wednesday, held that the provisions of Section 4(1)(a) & (b) of the PTF Act 2019, requiring the deduction 0.05 per cent of any funds in the Federation Account and 0.005 per cent of the net profit of companies operating in Nigeria to fund the police are unconstitutional. Justice Mohammed said the provisions are contrary to the provisions of Section 162(1) & (3) of the Constitution, requiring the payment of total revenue collected by the Government of the the Federation, including levies and taxes, into the Federation Action for sharing among the three tiers of government.
