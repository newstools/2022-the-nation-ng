Greece has donated about one million doses of the Johnson and Johnson (J&J) COVID-19 vaccine to Nigeria. Greece Minister of Foreign Affairs Nikos Dendias announced the donation in Abuja yesterday during a meeting with his Nigerian counterpart, Mr. Geoffrey Onyeama. Both countries also signed a Memorandum of Understanding on various areas of interest. Announcing the gesture, Dendias said: “I am happy that I am symbolically bringing with me a ‘present’ to the Nigerian society and to the Nigerian people. And this is almost a million doses of vaccine. “The entire world is suffering from COVID-19. But there is one huge achievement through this suffering, that we clearly understand that we are a world community. That nobody is safe unless everybody is safe. And all of us are under the moral obligation to be providers of help whenever and wherever assistance is needed.” - Advertisement - Dendias also assured that the vaccines would not be expired ones.

The Greek minister explained that such an expansion would culminate in the signing of Memoranda of Understanding on various issues affecting both countries. The visit is also the first by a Greek government official to Nigeria. Dendias’ visit to Nigeria after Ghana and Gabon highlights the importance Athens attached to strengthening relations with African countries. Onyeama, on his part, said Nigeria has enjoyed a smooth partnership with Greece in the area of defence. He said the present administration was willing to improve on the existing relationship between both countries.
