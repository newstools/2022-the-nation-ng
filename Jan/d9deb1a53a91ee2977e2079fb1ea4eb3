Stanbic IBTC Holdings Plc, a member of Standard Bank Group, has taken steps to ensure that the Super Eagles wins the ongoing African football tournament, the African Cup of Nations (AFCON), in Cameroun, its Chief Executive, Dr. Demola Sogunle, has said. Sogunle in a statement said Stanbic IBTC and the Nigerian Football Federation (NFF) entered into a partnership late last year, that would see the former, through its insurance subsidiary, Stanbic IBTC Insurance Limited, provide Group Life Insurance cover worth N1.73billion accident insurance cover for each player of the national team, worth N583 million yearly for the next three years. According to him, by this development, Stanbic IBTC becomes the  insurance sponsor of the Super Eagles as the MoU signed between the  organisation and the NFF came into effect the year.

Stanbic IBTC, as a foremost gender-balanced zealot, has sponsored four female sports correspondents: Funmilayo Adeyemo, Justina Aniefiok, Janefrances Nweze, and Faith Meregbunam to AFCON 2021.’’ The 2022 AFCON tournament has 24 participating teams. Nigeria bringing home the cup is the most anticipated expectation. Unlike previous years, the Super Eagles will go head-to-head with the Pharaohs of Egypt in the anticipated match, knowing that Stanbic IBTC Insurance fully covers them.
