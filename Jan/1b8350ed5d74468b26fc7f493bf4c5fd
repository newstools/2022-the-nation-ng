The Council of Maritime Transport Union Associations (COMTUA) has decried alleged extortion of truckers on the port access road in Lagos. It called for an end to the practice among officials of the enforcement team responsible for the free flow of traffic in and out of the port. COMTUA President Yinka Aroyewun alleged that truckers have become cash cows for officials of the enforcement team comprising the police, Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) and the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), among others. The union leader urged the police to end the extortion outside the port premises.

Some people believe when they talk about union, you are talking about louts. But we are law-abiding citizens who know the importance of the Maritime sector to the economy.” But the Assistant Inspector General of Police (AIG) Zone 2, Adeleke Adeyinka, assured the union that he would sanitise the traffic environment in Apapa. “Let me reassure that we will try as much as possible to bring sanity to the environment. There is no environment that is perfect. But we will do our best to stop the illegal act,” he said.
