Egypt captain Mohamed Salah believes that the time is right for him to win silverware with the national team after leading them to the Africa Cup of Nations quarter-finals. The Liverpool forward scored the decisive penalty on Wednesday as the Pharaohs beat Ivory Coast 5-4 in the shootout after their round-of-16 clash finished goalless at Japoma Stadium. Salah came close to winning it at the 2017 edition after losing to Cameroon in the final before crashing out in the Round of 16 at 2019 in Egypt. AFCON success has eluded the 29-year-old forward on the international stage thus far and he believes the team are in the right mood to win it this time around.

It’s my country, what I love the most. This trophy for me would be completely different, would be the closest to my heart,” he said after the nail-biting victory over the Elephants. “We were close before to win this African Cup (in 2017), we gave it everything but we were not lucky to win it. But it’s ok, now we are here in the new one. “We have to fight for it, we have to give everything to win it and I’m sure the players have the same feeling.”
