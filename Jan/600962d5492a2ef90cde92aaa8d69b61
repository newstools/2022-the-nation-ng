Agricultural Produce Sellers  Association of Nigeria (APSAN), has called on the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and other agricultural-related agencies to disburse funds accrued for farmers directly through their personal contacts. The association urged the Ministry to adopt the Nigeria Incentive-Based Risk Sharing System for Agricultural Lending (NIRSAL) methodology in reaching out to farmers directly without passing through states and local government councils. This was the position of the National President of the association, Comrade Aloys Akortsaha stated this during a press briefing in Abuja. He said the measure will make it difficult to short-change farmers and boost productivity, the  sector and the economy. According to him, empowering farmers and agripreneurs is tantamount to  diversifying the economy.
