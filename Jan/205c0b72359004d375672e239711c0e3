Actress Rita Edochie has said IPOB’s leader, Nnamdi Kanu became an agitator due to bad governance. Edochie, who has remained vocal about the release of the IPOB leader, made this known while captioning a video clip of Rev Father Ejike Mbaka of Adoration Ministry Enugu while he addressed his congregation. In the clip, Mbaka warned the Department of State Services and the Federal Government against manhandling Kanu while in their custody. According to the cleric, Kanu’s agitation is a result of bad governance and wicked leadership.
