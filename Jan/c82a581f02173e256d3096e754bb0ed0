The Niger State Police Command has refuted claims by some news outlets that 37 people were killed in Nakundna and Wurukuchi communities in Shiroro Local Government Area; insisting that 13 people lost their lives when suspected bandits/terrorists attacked some villagers who were harvesting crops. The Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the Niger Police Command Wasiu Abiodun, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), said: “The Command wishes to state that, on January 10, at about 10 in the morning, suspected bandits/terrorists stormed Nakundna Village near Kaure in Shiroro Local Government Area, and unfortunately, 13 people, who were harvesting in their farms, lost their lives as a result of the attack.

He equally advised reporters to avoid rushing to publish stories without adequate verification to avoid causing panic and public outrage.
