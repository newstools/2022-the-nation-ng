He said: “I have been into music since I was 11 years old but professionally started my music career in 2020. I am a very simple person who just wants to sing and be heard globally. I was born into a family that loves music. My sister started composing songs way before I started and she is just beautifully talented. I started out composing RnB songs. I also used to rap in secondary school, but at some point, I just fell in love with Afrobeats. Over the years, I have been sharpening my craft and observing how the music and industry works.”   Labule releases new single, Zero     Saheed Osupa urges Fuji stars to improve on lyrics     Gifted ranks top, enters season three   Read Also: Gifted ranks top, enters season three On his EP, he said, “On this project, I wanted to show my range and talk about my experience as a young African dishing out stories of love and good vibes.
