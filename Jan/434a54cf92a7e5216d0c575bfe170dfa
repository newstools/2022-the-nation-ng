A factional leader of All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers State Sen. Magnus Abe has said the struggle in the state party is for justice and fair play, and not about him. He spoke yesterday in Ogba/Egbema/Ndoni Local Government Area (ONELGA) at the inauguration of Rivers Voice of Freedom (RVF), a group founded to support his political interests and ambition in 2023. The group also supports the presidential ambition of former Lagos State Governor Bola Ahmed Tinubu.   ‘Six months’ forex inflows can offset Nigeria’s $44b debts’     CBN to retain rates in crucial pre-election cycle     Ex-NERC boss: DisCos under AMCON management won’t benefit…   Abe told the crowd that contrary to the impression in some quarters that the crisis in Rivers APC was caused by his ambition to become governor, it was a struggle for righteousness and the desire of the masses. “There is no history of evil overcoming good, there is no history of those who have not hurt coming out to be able to trample on you.
