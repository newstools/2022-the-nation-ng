The game started just as it ended, with a spot-kick that went Burkina Faso’s way after Sidney Obissa committed a foul in the area.

The Aston Villa forward made no mistake in the 28th minute when set free one-on-one and, forced to shoot early in the face of the onrushing goalkeeper, he slotted home via the post. Aaron Boupendza had an equaliser ruled out due to a tight offside call and life got even tougher for Gabon in the second-half when Obissa picked up his second booking for an off the ball shove.
