GHANA forward Benjamin Tetteh may not feature again at the Africa Cup of Nations after being handed a three-match ban. The 24-year-old was sent off for his part in an on-pitch melee after full-time following the Black Stars’ 1-1 draw against Gabon on Friday. The disciplinary board of the Confederation of African Football (Caf), the tournament organisers, added an extra game to the standard two-match ban for a straight red card. Tetteh, who was an injury-time substitute against the Panthers, will miss Ghana’s final Group C match against Comoros on Tuesday.
