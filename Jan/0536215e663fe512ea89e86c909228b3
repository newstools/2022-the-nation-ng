The National Committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Support Groups for Al-Makura (NA-CASA) has said the North Central remains the only zone that is yet to play a major role in the evolution of its national leadership. The group said the zone has not been at national level positions in spite of its overwhelming support for the party. National Chairman of the group, Chief Chukwunonso Ezedinma, who stated this in Abuja at a press briefing said, the emergence of former Governor of Nasarawa State, Senator Tanko Al-Makura, as the National Chairman of the APC would guarantee the future and survival of the party beyond 2023. Ezedinma said Al-Makura who is from the North Central region is a detribalised Nigerian, who in his 8-year exemplary tenure in Nasarawa State, integrated all Nigerians through appointments and service delivery in his developmental vision for the state.

He said: “For steady inclusiveness that is devoid of rancour and multiple litigations, Al-Makura is the antidote for APC progress. “A consensus arrangement in our party at this time will make a rancour-free process and for party progress. “Among the four legacy parties that came together to form the APC, it is on record that apart from the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), all the major stakeholder-blocs of the APC, including the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) and the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) blocs have had a shot in party leadership”.
