Former world No. 1 Rafael Nadal is grateful for the career he has had since he has achieved much more than he has ever dreamed. Nadal, 35, is one of the most accomplished players in tennis history as he is tied with Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer on the all-time Grand Slam record list with 20 Majors. Also, Nadal owns a record of 13 French Open titles. After his second round win at the Australian Open, Nadal was asked about those who felt he would burn out early. “Well, the positive thing is I achieved much more than I ever dreamed. I was able to spend almost 20 fantastic years on the tour. The rest of the things nothing positive because arrives in the end,” Nadal said, per Sportskeeda. “When you get older, the watch never stops, no (smiling)? That’s the circus of life.

But it’s all good with me with that.” “In terms of tennis career, okay, you can say I’m more experienced. I don’t get that positive point (smiling).” - Advertisement - Nadal plays next Karen Khachanov, the Russian he considers as a tough opponent. “I don’t know. I am in the third round. I need to win very tough matches to be there. Is not in my mind now. I have enough work I don’t like,” the Spaniard said. “I think playing against Khachanov now, probably Khachanov, going to be a big challenge. Always is a big challenge against Karen.” Nadal is hoping to win a record 21st Grand Slam title at Melbourne Park. “In my situation today going to be even more. I never think that far. You can imagine now less than ever, no? Just staying focused on my daily work, on what’s coming, and that’s it. One moment in time, that’s it,” Nadal added.
