He stated however that the film is a means of documenting history through one of the best art forms for preservation, filmmaking. - Advertisement - “We made this biopic not just to entertain as films do, but to put history on record. And we couldn’t have done it at a better time, as our actors had the opportunity to draw inspiration from the real-life characters without having to base their knowledge on second-hand tales.
