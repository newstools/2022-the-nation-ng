He was known among many Muslims in the nook and cranny of Nigeria as a very religious person whose effrontery in the face of truth endeared him to many Muslims. He was a friend to the late Head of State General Murtala Muhammad, who was also a man many Nigerians love during his lifetime even after his death. “He was one of the first generations of medical doctors in Kano, who graduated from University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan, Oyo State. He was a former presidential aspirant under the defunct Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the First President-General Supreme Council for Sharia in Nigeria. “Supreme Council for Sharia will ever remember Dr. Ahmad for his immense contributions towards humanity. May Allah forgive him and admit him in Al Jannah Firdaws.”
