SENEGAL’S underwhelming start to the Africa Cup of Nations continued as they were held to a drab goalless draw by Guinea in Group B. Led by Liverpool star Sadio Mane but without the likes of Edouard Mendy, Kalidou Koulibaly and Idrissa Gueye, the pre-tournament favourites were in the ascendancy for much of the second half after a poor opening period at Bafoussam’s Kouekong Stadium, but couldn’t find a way through as they missed the chance to seal their spot in the last 16 alongside hosts Cameroon.

Guinea started Friday’s West Africa derby much the stronger, with left-back Issiaga Sylla – who scored the winning goal against Malawi earlier this week – the danger man as he needed no second invitation to spring forward and Mane’s Liverpool team-mate Naby Keita also excelling. However, chances were at a real premium, with the best falling to Morgan Guilavogui, who was denied by QPR goalkeeper Seny Dieng after being teed up by RB Leipzig starlet Ilaix Moriba following a swift Guinea counter-attack.
