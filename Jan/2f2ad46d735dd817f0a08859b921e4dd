Sub-Saharan, national, regional and international reinsurers achieved an average yearly growth in gross written premiums of 9.15 per cent between 2011 and 2020, a report by the Atlas Group, an insurance and reinsurance analyst, has shown. According to the report, the performance comes at a time local currencies are experiencing significant depreciation against the dollar. Nigeria’s Naira and South Africa’s Rand, for example, depreciated by 63.5 per cent and 54.8 per cent over the past decade. This premium growth is mainly attributed to non-life insurance. With the exception of South Africa, life insurance is not very developed in many Sub-Saharan countries. From 2011 to last year, this growth dynamic was punctuated by periods of double-digit growth (+19 per cent in 2013, +15 per cent in 2017) and others marked by a sharp decline (-10 per cent in 2015).   ‘Why you need motor insurance’     Way forward for insurance, by experts     LandWey gets GPWIN certification   - Advertisement - The contraction in premiums, observed between 2014 and 2016, was due, among others, to the collapse of oil prices. With the economic recovery from 2016 to 2019, the curve quickly recovered. During this period, premiums grew by an average of 12.8 per cent over four years. The COVID-19 pandemic, however, plunged the market back into stagnation with reinsurance premiums growing by 0.82 per cent in 2020. Of note is that Sub-Saharan reinsurers are  focused on local risks. They are, therefore, not exposed to losses linked to natural catastrophes. The region’s average loss ratio is, therefore, better than that exhibited by the global reinsurance market. The average loss ratio for 2020, stands at 59.5 per cent for AM Best rated reinsurers in the subcontinent, compared to 76.2 per cent for the top 50 global reinsurers. In 2016, this ratio was 53.2 per cent. In the absence of major claims, this nearly six-point deterioration in the loss ratio in four years is accounted for by fierce competition, the erosion of premium rates, rising claims costs with the depreciation of local currencies particularly for reinsurers that operate in dollars and set up their balance sheets in local currency, economic instability and political uncertainty. Another factor points to the management expenses that are often high.  This increase in administration and business acquisition costs affects the management expense ratio and by extension the combined ratio. Management expenses amounted to 38.4 per cent in 2020 for all reinsurers in Sub-Saharan Africa, compared to 28.7 per cent for the top 50 reinsurers worldwide. The average combined ratio for the region stood at 97.9 per cent in 2020. It fluctuated between 91.2 per cent and 93.2 per cent during  2014-2016 before reaching a peak of 99.2 per cent in 2019.
