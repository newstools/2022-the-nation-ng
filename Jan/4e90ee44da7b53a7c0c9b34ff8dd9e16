Arsenal were held to a 0-0 draw at the Emirates this afternoon as Burnley put on a resilient defensive display. Mikel Arteta’s first win in 2022 will have to wait until February 10 as we head into the winter break. Their impressive December form has been undone as they are now winless from their last five matches. Sean Dyche can be proud of his players, each and every one of them put in a shift today to deny Arsenal any hope of taking the lead. They were put under pressure in the second half but they did the basics well and frustrated Arsenal.

Kieran Tierney picked out Emile Smith-Rowe wonderfully on the left flank. The England international went on an excellent solo run, taking the ball to the byline and found Alexandre Lacazette with a cut-back. The Frenchman had an open goal as Nick Pope came out to close the angle, but he failed to find the target and his shot dribbled miserably wide. - Advertisement - For the Clarets, drawing matches probably is not enough to keep them up but it sure is better than nothing. They still have four games on Norwich who sit in the all-important 17th spot. Dyche’s men are four points from safety but will have to host both Manchester United and Liverpool next month. Theathletic
