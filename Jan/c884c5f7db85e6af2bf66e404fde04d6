Alloa defender Nandy Mendy is excited about his inclusion in the Guinea-Bissau squad for the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) while the Scotland-based star is ready to mount the backline against Nigeria’s Super Eagles and Pharaohs of Egypt. Mendy is, however, excited about his chance to stop Mohamed Salah after an “early Christmas present” gave him the opportunity to match up with the Liverpool forward in Cameroon. The 27-year-old was a late call-up to the Guinea-Bissau squad for the tournament, which gets underway this weekend. He could also face Rangers’ midfielder Joe Aribo after his inclusion in the Nigeria squad and Mendy is delighted his call-up for the competition has given his country some extra support at the competition.

I was very happy, very surprised,” Mendy told Sky Sports News.”That was two days before Christmas, I saw it as an early Christmas gift. It’s amazing, I’m just proud to be there.” - Advertisement - Mendy admitted it took some time for the news to sink in as he was not on the first squad list. With Egypt in Guinea-Bissau’s group alongside Sudan and Nigeria, the centre-back is relishing the chance of coming up against Salah and is not afraid of facing the two-time African footballer of the year. “He’s one of the best players in the world so he has his qualities and I have mine,” he said. “MO is much better than me so I’ll just try to do my best and try to stop him. I have teammates and they’re going to help me. If I can’t catch him, someone else will catch him. “Just being in the squad is amazing. I’m just going to enjoy the moment and try to get into the team. Normally players can’t stop Mo Salah but we’re going to try and do our best.”
