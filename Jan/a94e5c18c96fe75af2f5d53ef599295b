Anambra State governor-elect Prof. Chukwuma Soludo is planning a low-key inauguration, Commissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment Mr. C Don Adinuba has said. He described the purported rift between Governor Willie Obiano and Soludo as the handiwork of the opposition. Adinuba said it was a disinformation campaign against the government. He said the opposition should look for another thing to do since the election ended over two months ago, adding that the relationship between Obiano and Soludo remained cordial.
