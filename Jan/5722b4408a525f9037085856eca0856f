He said: “Our determination this year is to prepare a budget that is achievable and implementable. We called the stakeholders’ consultative meeting, where every sector that makes up the local government listed their areas of interest. “What we are doing here is to allocate funds, sector by sector, so that no part of the council will be short-changed in infrastructural development.
