The Senate Public Accounts Committee (SPAC) has begun investigation into how the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) allegedly failed to remit $679.4 million yearly proceeds from various ports concession to 23 companies under the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) for 10 years. The committee, chaired by Matthew Urhoghide, based its probe on the report of a 2016 report of the Auditor General of the Federation (AuGF), Adolphus Aghughu, referred to it for consideration. According to the AuGF query, 23 companies were granted concessional rent at various ports under the NPA for 10 years and above at an associated yearly rent of $679.4 million payable to NPA as at December 31. The AuGF alleged that there was no evidence to show that $679 million was collected as at when due and remitted to Consolidated Revenue Fund. The AuGF query reads: “Twenty-three companies were granted concessional rent of various ports under Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) for 10 years and above with associated yearly rent of $679,403,172.00 payable to NPA as at December 31, 2016. - Advertisement - “There is no evidence to show that $679,403,172.00 was collected as at when due and remitted to the Consolidated Revenue Fund. “This has been communicated to the Bureau vide letter with reference number OAuGF/RESAD/05/2016/07, dated April 19, 2018. No response has been received from the Bureau.

Also, it may lead to diversion of funds to other uses. “The director general is required to show evidence that $679,403,172.00 was collected and remitted to the appropriate authority.” In its written response to the Senate panel, the BPE explained that the concession transactions were done in 2005 and the concession agreement executed clearly showed that the BPE was only a confirming party while the primary party to the concessions was the Nigerian Port Authority (NPA). The agency also insisted that the responsibility for such collection was that of NPA and not that of BPE. BPE added: “Having midwifed the concession transactions, the BPE collected some of the remittance to the NPA. “The NPA has since acknowledged the transfer made regarding the rentals received on its behalf by the Bureau. “Revenue accruing on the ports concession have, beyond 2008, been paid directly to ‘landlord’ (NPA) and not the BPE as the OAuGF report appears to allege. “We are, therefore, unaware of the $679.4 million.”
