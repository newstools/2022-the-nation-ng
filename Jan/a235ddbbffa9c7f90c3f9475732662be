He said the state was eager to have its first private university and that the government would support such initiatives as it would accord the people more access to education. He also urged the clergy to speak up against injustice in the country, stating that Nigeria is in dire need of such voices due to the ills in the society. - Advertisement - Diri attributed the successes recorded under his administration to God and appreciated the Anglican Primate for the visit.

So, we are very happy and prepared to host the Anglican university. “The Anglican Church has over the years produced leaders of worth. It is a good thing that we have an Anglican institution domiciled in Bayelsa and we believe that it is going to impact the state and add value to the Niger Delta region. “Some of us are where we are today because of the upbringing we received in the Anglican schools we attended. “Our country is going through difficult times. The Anglican Church in Nigeria needs a voice like South Africa’s late Desmond Tutu, who stood against injustice, against inequity in his country and the world. “We have Bishop Matthew Kukah of the Catholic Church. The Anglican Church can equally stand up against inequity and inequality.” Ndukuba said he was in the state to dedicate a Bishop’s Court Chapel and Diocesan Secretariat of the Diocese of Niger Delta West. The Primate explained that the Anglican Church in Nigeria was self-governing and self-sustaining, and would continue to stand against heresies. Ndukuba appreciated the governor for creating an enabling environment for the promotion of the Gospel of Christ in the state.
