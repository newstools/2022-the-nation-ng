The National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, has condoled with the Federal Government, the Government of Ogun State, and the family of former Interim Head of State, Chief Ernest Shonekan, who died on Tuesday. In a statement on Tuesday, Ayu described the late Shonekan as a detribalised Nigerian and elder statesman who gave Nigeria his best. According to Ayu: “His death is a sunset on an illustrious career that straddled both the corporate sector and the public service. “We are consoled that he lived a fulfilled life and that his legacy of public service will outlive him.” The PDP chairman prayed to God to grant him eternal rest and also give the family the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss.

Describing the death as saddening, Atiku said as a politician or a boardroom guru, Chief Shonekan possessed a unique skill of bringing stability to a tumultuous situation. “That obviously was the consideration that made him become Head of the Interim National Government following the crises that greeted the events after the June 12 presidential election. “Although his reign as Head of State was interim, Chief Shonekan’s contribution to the peace and development of Nigeria in those days and latter years, remain enduring. “My condolences go to his immediate family, the people and government of Ogun State and the entire nation for the loss of a man of industry and intellect, who lived a life of service to the country and humanity. It is my prayer that God almighty receives his soul in a peaceful repose,” Atiku said.
