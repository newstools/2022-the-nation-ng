Over four million Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) have benefitted from the over N150billion deployed in the past five years, the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, said yesterday. Osinbajo, made this known yesterday in Abuja at the Bank of Industry’s (BOI’s) Aid for Productivity report launch, which chronicled the development, impact and future of the BOI’s Growth Platform, which is the human and technology infrastructure used to drive multiple large-scale intervention programmes for MSMEs. “Beyond providing interest-free microcredit loans to petty traders, the various social intervention schemes of the Buhari administration have made significant impact in the lives of millions of ordinary Nigerians,” he said, saying in furtherance of its determination to boost economic growth, the Administration has also ramped up its support for the MSMEs sector, which accounts for close to 50 per cent of Nigeria’s GDP and 76 per cent of the country’s labour force.

This is an example of what we can achieve when we unleash the best of our people – especially our young – on the toughest of our challenges, and give them the free-hand to deliver results”. - Advertisement - Osinbajo said the the success of the BOI Growth Platform was the story of the Nigerian can-do spirit and the entrepreneurial DNA we carry. The Vice President listed the BOI Growth Platform to include interventions schemes, such as the renowned Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme (GEEP) loans (MarketMoni, FarmerMoni and TraderMoni) – regarded as Africa’s largest fully-digitized micro-credit scheme, the MSME Survival Fund under the Economic Sustainability Plan (ESP), the North-East Rehabilitation Fund, the recently launched World Bank $750million NG-CARES programme, and state-based interventions, among others. He said over “57 per cent of these MSMEs are owned by Nigerians below 35 years of age, and close to 60 per cent of the beneficiaries are women. What is even less glaring is that the team of Nigerian professionals behind this work is largely young, with an average age of 28 years old.”
