Media personality Noble Igwe has blamed society for aiding and abating crime through the celebration of untraceable/questionable wealth. The fashion blogger made this claim in reaction to a report of four teenage boys who confessed to killing and burning a young girl’s head for a money ritual in Abeokuta, Ogun State. The style icon, in a thread via his Twitter handle, said these atrocities can be nipped in the bud if the society stops celebrating overnight success and all types of questionable wealth. According to him: “Every day, we are on different pages of people we know that cannot afford certain things shouting “God when” then come here to act surprised that people are doing evil to ‘belong. Our society does not question the source of anything.

They don’t sell cocktails or beer and when people other expensive drinks, music is shut down to deliver drink(s) to one person or a group. People will kill or commit crimes to get such treatment. “People will post three skits in a year and then post a house they just brought, people will appear in two movies then post “new me, new house”. Thing is, we celebrate all types of questionable wealth. “The church will take donation from anyone with money, the village will crown anyone with money, no questions asked. Families don’t ask their children how they make their money and some don’t care. It’s the society that feeds this monster. “I need to stop now. I’m already seeing my tweets on blogs. Remember, family is important in shaping society and we owe it to one another to fix our homes. Stop celebrating overnight untraceable success,” he tweeted.
