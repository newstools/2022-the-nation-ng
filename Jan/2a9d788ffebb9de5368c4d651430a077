Nigeria’s U20 Girls, Falconets will fly into the city of Douala today  ahead of a FIFA U20 Women’s World Cup, fourth round, first leg encounter against their Cameroonian counterparts, scheduled for Saturday, 22nd  January at the Stade Japoma. This fixture, being the penultimate round of the qualification series, is guaranteed to produce fireworks in both legs, with the eternal rivalry between Nigeria and Cameroon being the strongest undertone in the narrative.
