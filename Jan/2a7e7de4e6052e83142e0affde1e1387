Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has assured fans that his ‘heart is absolutely fine’ after the Arsenal striker was forced to return from AFCON early due to cardiac issues. Aubameyang did not get to kick a ball in Africa, having contracted Covid and then missed out on selection after suffering ‘cardiac lesions’. The 32-year-old underwent tests back in London and has revealed the results were positive. “Hi guys, I came back to London to do some additional checks, and I’m very happy to say that my heart is absolutely fine and I’m completely healthy!!” he wrote alongside a picture of himself in the gym. “Really appreciate all the messages over the last few days and I’m already back at it.”   Nadal relishes exciting tennis career     Qatar 2022: 1.2 million tickets sold in 24 hours     Golden Jubilee Polo Tourney: Fallen heroes honoured in Port…   - Advertisement - Sportsmail has previously reported that there was a degree of confusion over the situation, and manager Arteta has revealed Aubameyang will now undergo tests. Quizzed on the star, he said: “He’s in London and going through some examinations because we haven’t had any clarity from Gabon about why he came back. “So it’s our obligation to make sure he’s safe and in good condition. So far historically with what we’ve done with the player that’s never been an issue.’” It remains to be seen whether Arteta will welcome him back in from the cold after stripping him of the captaincy and dropping him. When asked whether the 32-year-old will ever play for him again, he added: “He contracted Covid and then the national team decided to bring him back here. “We need to make sure the player’s health is in the best possible condition and then we’ll see what happens.”
