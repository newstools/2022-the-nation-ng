Benue State Commissioner for Information, Culture and Tourism, Hon. Michael Inalegwu says all Nigerians regret voting General Muhammadu Buhari as the nation’s president. He spoke over the weekend during a world press conference he addressed in reaction to a press statement by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media, Mallam Garba Shehu. According to the Commissioner, “It will interest Shehu to know that it is not only the Governor that regrets voting Buhari as President in 2015. Majority of Nigerians, including his die-hard supporters in 2015 and 2019 do and it is only those who are deaf, probably like Shehu, that cannot hear the loud cry by Nigerians to be rescued by the PDP from APC’s mismanagement of Nigeria’s political leadership since 2015.”   North must produce Buhari’s successor, says Bala…     Amid probe, Abba Kyari makes first public appearance at IGP…     APC chair: Governors in the dark as Buhari keeps party…   The information commissioner said Garba Shehu was right to have said “Nigeria has had enough of failed politicians” and will be too glad to see one of them, President Muhammadu Buhari leave office next year. The Commissioner noted that Governor Ortom who has championed the course of ranching in the country is a politician that proffers solution to challenges that confront Nigeria, unlike President Buhari who is bent on reviving cattle routes in the 21st century. - Advertisement - He said it is surprising that the President’s media aide in his reaction to Governor Ortom’s interview on Arise TV failed to make reference to the grave security challenges confronting the country in spite of the facts and figures reeled out by the Governor to prove the despicable deterioration of the security situation nationally and in Benue State under President Buhari. Inalegwu said it is shameful for Garba Shehu to refer to President Buhari’s recommendation for the return of the century-old animal husbandry which is not implementable in this age.
