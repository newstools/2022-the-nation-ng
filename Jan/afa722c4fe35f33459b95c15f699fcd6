The mother of one stressed how disappointing it is when people address her as ‘Wizkid’s baby mama’ without recognising her achievements long before meeting the music star aiming for his second Grammy Awards. “I think about this…It’s so degrading and discriminating when I’m referred to as Wizkid’s 3rd baby mother before addressing me professionally by my name. The credit of my Journey/experience is so underrated. The sad thing is, it’s our own blogs that don’t heighten & uplift each other,” she tweeted.
