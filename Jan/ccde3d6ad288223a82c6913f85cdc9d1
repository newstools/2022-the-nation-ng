Libya, another member nation, has experienced a 200, 000 bpd cut in her production by the end of last year. In Nigeria’s 2022 budget, the projected crude output stands at 1.88 mbpd, although allocation to the country by the cartel stood at about 1.47 mbpd, a sharp contrast from its 1.66mbpd approved for her last December.
