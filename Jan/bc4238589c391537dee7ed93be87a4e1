I was a bit scared, I mean I was just operating against the background of people getting used to, that his movies are always doing well so I was saying I hope this one will not be the one that will make people say that this time around we are tired of seeing this man succeed. “But I’m happy they have allowed it, permitted it and they have shown it by a way of putting their money where their mouth is by going to support the AY brand, and more importantly I’m just happy that people are supporting Nollywood so it is not just about AY, it is not about my film, it is about the fact that Nollywood is being appreciated because one win for one is a win for all.” AY however noted that it took almost 12 months to put the Christmas movie together, from scripting to pre-production, production and post-production.
