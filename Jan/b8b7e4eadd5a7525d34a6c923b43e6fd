President Muhammadu Buhari’s single-biggest capital project is in the Southeast, Senate Chief Whip Orji Uzor Kalu told kinsmen yesterday. He spoke in his Camp Neya country home in Igbere, during a meeting he convened for the executive committee members of his political structures, the OUK Movement, and Reality Organisations from the 17 local government areas and 295 wards in Abia State. The senator described the N369 billion Second Niger Bridge as the Federal Government’s single biggest capital project to be cited in any geo-political zone in the country. He, therefore, urged the people of the Southeast to have faith in the president and support his administration. “The president still has 17 months in office and has a role to play in 2023. He may surprise the Southeast zone,” Kalu said. - Advertisement - Kalu, who was governor between 1999 and 2007, described Buhari as a “highly disciplined leader”, saying that his administration’s commitment to the 100 per cent budget implementation in 2020 and 2021 has been unprecedented since 1999.
