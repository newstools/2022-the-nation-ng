Musician Paul Play Dairo has said that money isn’t enough for talents to be heard. The UK- based singer and songwriter dished out some advice to budding musicians who think money is all that is needed to attain stardom. Dairo noted that having all the money does not secure an automatic spot for artists in the music industry as he gave his personal experience as a producer and music executive. “Yes money is everything but at the same time what money cannot do in this game does exist,” he said.

I will tell you for a fact, somebody came to my studio, signed 19 artistes and he never made any money. None of these artistes actually made any dime for him. “So I’m saying why do you think big labels like Universal drop artistes? It’s because they spend so much money and they never get anything out of these artistes. You need to win your craft, you need to keep building yourself, and you need to work on yourself. “If you don’t get your PR right, if you don’t get your producer right and every aspect right you’re gonna lose money. So, money is not everything.”
