It was supposed to be out in 2021 but again the sound just wasn’t right”. The songstress added “When I started working with my partners Jonz world, we discovered that maybe experimenting in more authentic sound real to me which is R&B and Soul. “All the sounds I had were great but they were like, it just sounds like I was trying to fix it with my other contemporaries, why not you go back to the drawing board and make music that you grow up on which obviously is that RnB vibe.”
