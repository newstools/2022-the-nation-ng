The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has denied attempting to set ablaze the palace of Eze Amaifeke in Orlu Local Government Area of Imo State, Emmanuel Okeke. The Imo Command’s spokesman Michael Abattam, a Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP), had said on Monday that a suspected IPOB member was gunned down in the foiled attack. The Army had also accused IPOB of carrying out attacks despite calling off its sit-at-home. It accused the group of deception, saying the sit-at-home was still being enforced by IPOB members. But, the group said on Tuesday that it had no basis to go after monarchs. - Advertisement - It described the allegation as a blatant lie from the pit of hell. IPOB’s Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, in a statement restated its claim to non-violence. “The Army and police…have started with falsehood to demonise their innocent victims.
