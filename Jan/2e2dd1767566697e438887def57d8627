To further drive awareness on retirement issues, Inspenonline Limited has initiated a YouTube programme to educate the public on the benefits of a retirement plan. Its Managing Director, Chuks Udo Okonta, said the firm unfolded the programme to address the dearth of knowledge on retirement and help the public to understand and maximise the opportunities to prepare for life after active service. He said his decision was informed after he engaged in research to ascertain the quality of content on retirement and observed a huge dearth of local content available to help the public put in place a retirement plan.

He said: “Information is the life-wire of business and vital to human development. Therefore, we are poised to exchange necessary information with all stakeholders in the retirement space. As blissful retirement remains the desire of all, the Retirement Matters programme was conceived to provide and promote knowledge required to achieve the quest for a better future after a resourceful active life. - Advertisement - “Our programme hinges on interviews, feedback, analysis, reportage and more. Through these avenues, we will derive information and disseminate them to the end-users. The interview section will create opportunities for the regulator and operators to address issues and give updates on events in the sector. It will also create an opportunity for the end-users of retirement products and services to express themselves and make contributions on how the regulator and operators can improve their performances.”
