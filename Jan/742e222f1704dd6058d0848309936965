Commercial drivers plying Warri, Eku, Abraka/Agbor roads in Delta State yesterday protested what they described as extortion and dehumanisation against them by government agents and motor park workers, popularly called the Agbero. They marched on Effurun, Eku streets, carrying placards with inscriptions to protest multiple ticket levies allegedly collected by government agents.

One of the drivers, Mr. Overcomer Eze, who spoke on behalf of the protesters, said they paid for Delta State Government ticket known as Updelta several times, when one ticket from the state government was supposed to cover them within the state for one day. The demonstrators promised to take their protest to the Government House in Asaba, alleging that the passenger welfare scheme levy was being deducted from the drivers’ money in the name of a manifest.
