The European football governing body, UEFA has hailed the return of Victor Osimhen to duty with Napoli after two months of inactivity due to injury coupled with Covid-19. Osimhen was a second substitute in Napoli’s 2-0 away win over Bologna on matchday 22 of Italian Serie A. Osimhen returned to the pitch with a black mask against Bologna more than 50 days after the last match against Inter. UEFA also welcomed him through social media and wrote: “It’s nice to see Osimhen in action against Bologna on Monday evening”. The Nigerian with his Napoli will challenge Barcelona in the round of 16 of the Europa League.

He sustained a cheekbone injury against Inter at the end of November and was supposed to remain out of action for three months. However, he was able to make a quick return, less than two months after his injury, wearing a protective mask. The 23-year-old also took to social media after the match to express the joy of his return to action. “Feels so good to be back,” wrote the striker. “Solid performance from the boys. Onto the next one, GOD is the greatest. We move.” Osimhen was supposed to play in the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) with Nigeria but tested positive before the beginning of the competition, so he was withdrawn from the squad list and returned to Naples at the beginning of January, once his swab test came back negative. The Nigeria international has nine goals in 15 appearances across all competitions with the Partenopei this season.
