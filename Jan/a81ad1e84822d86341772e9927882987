ordeals, she said: “That fateful day, I went to work, I was in my room and then I got up to get water in the fridge and that was it. “I fell, I blanked out and when I regained my consciousness I thought it was just one of those things and I wanted to get up and walk but I couldn’t.” She continued: “There I was looking at my phone but I couldn’t call for help.
