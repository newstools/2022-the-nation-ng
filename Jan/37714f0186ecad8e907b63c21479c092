KARL Toko Ekambi’s double fired Cameroon into the semi-finals of the Africa Cup of Nations with a 2-0 victory over the Gambia. The forward took his tally for the tournament to five goals, scoring twice in seven minutes early in the second half as the host nation became the first team to book their spot in the last four. It proved a game too far for the Gambia, who had already upset the odds to reach the quarter-finals in their first ever AFCON appearance, having begun their run in the preliminary qualifying rounds. For Cameroon, the victory was a poignant one as they returned to action for the first time eight people were killed in a crush outside their last-16 meeting with Comoros on Monday.
