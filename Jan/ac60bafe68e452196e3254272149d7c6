It is estimated that security votes add up to over N241.2 billion every year.” “On top of appropriated security votes, state governments also receive millions of dollars yearly as international security assistance. “Longstanding allegations of corruption and mismanagement of security votes have hugely contributed to the growing insecurity in the country, and the failure of authorities to effectively discharge their constitutional responsibility to ensure the security and welfare of their own people.”
