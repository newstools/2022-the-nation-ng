Amuneke, Okoye differ on  ‘fantastic’ Salah     Eagles caretaker coach hopeful on Ighalo     Ekong eyes  quality replacement  for  Balogun   “I think Senegal and Egypt are really strong but we can defeat them as nothing is special and we are eager to give our best in Cameroon,” he added. Olayinka however, promised to compensate for his inclusion in the team by giving his best in Cameroon. “I have always been given my best and they should expect more from me in Cameroon. I will give my best as I want to make my country proud,” Olayinka promised. Meanwhile, caretaker coach Austin Eguavoen  yesterday gave an inkling on why  Olayinka was drafted  for injured Napoli striker, Victor Osimhen: “I have watched Olayinka play in recent time but not Amoo. Amoo is very good but Onyekuru, Dennis and a few others have been in the Eagles before now. They were preferred ahead of him.”
