Queues for Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) at filling stations in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) following an artificial scarcity have eased off. As of yesterday, normalcy has been restored as many fuel stations at the Central Business District and Nyanya-Karu-Kurudu-Orozo-Karshi axis were currently selling at a normal rate of N165 per litre and dispensing with all pumping machines. Last week, many fuel stations were seen closed, hoarding or dispensing PMS with one or two pumping machines with queues amid a scarcity in the FCT. The situation continued, in spite of assurances given by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC) that it had an abundant stock of PMS to meet domestic needs; hence panic-buying should be avoided. In a chat with reporters, the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority, Abuja Zonal Office said the artificial fuel scarcity experienced in the FCT was in anticipation of subsidy removal.
