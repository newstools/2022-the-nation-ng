Social media personality Joro Olumofin has put forward to the ladies the financial yardstick to meet if they must consider getting married in 2022. Olumofin argued that a lady without a million naira of N500,000 in her account has no business desiring marriage. According to him, if marriage happens for such a lady, she will be at the mercy of the man and must condone all of his excesses. The self-acclaimed love doctor said: “Hi guys, it’s Joro Olumofin, the love doctor. This is 2022, I’m just going to drop this real quick. “Ladies, if you’re not a millionaire or if you don’t have up to N500,000 in your account, you shouldn’t be thinking about marriage at all. - Advertisement -   Every man wants me, says BBNaija’s Maria     Doctors said I wouldn’t make it past 2020, says Uche Ogbodo     Mbaka gifts ‘Akanchawa’ singer Gozie new Lexus   “The mistake a lot of ladies make is that they think they can blow through meeting a man and relying on a man’s money. “But what that does to you is that you’re going to be dependent on that man and you’re going to take every single baggage that comes with him because you don’t have your own money. “You know, it’s not only vex money you need in dating, you need vex money in relationships and marriages too. “When, if he does something you can’t take, you just pack your bags and leave.” Joro Olumofin further advised ladies without money in their accounts to seek self-development and increase their earning before love. “So, ladies, if you’re not a millionaire or if you don’t have up to N500,000 or a million naira in your account, you shouldn’t be thinking about marriage. You should develop yourself first,” he said. “So, please! Please!! Find money first before love.”
