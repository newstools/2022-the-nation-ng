Nyako, who responded to Ozekhome plea, reiterated her earlier order for the DSS to allow Kanu to enjoy some comfort. She, however, reminded his counsel that a detention facility is not a five-star hotel. “I don’t want to see him in these clothes again. This one is almost off-white. Also, make sure that you allow him to exercise,” Nyako added.
