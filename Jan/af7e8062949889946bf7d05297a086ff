The Management of BEDC Electricity Plc. (BEDC) has commended Illah community in Oshimili North Local Government Area of Delta State for its role in the arrest of electricity vandals, stressing the rising cases of vandalism across its franchise areas which it says aside being an economic crime is an act of sabotage against the good purpose and intents of the company. The management said, the power sector has been the most hit in the most devastating manner and the effect of vandalism cannot be over emphasised as residential customers, industries, small and medium scale businesses are being starved of power as a result of the activities of vandals.
