Egypt national team manager, Carlos Queiroz, has described his team’s disappointing performance as poor in their 1-0 loss to Nigeria in the AFCON. Egypt couldn’t have asked for the worst start to their 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) campaign in terms of both results and performance. The Pharaohs fell to a 1-0 defeat against Nigeria, through a first-half goal from Kelechi Iheanacho. The Super Eagles were by far the more dangerous side for the entirety of the encounter and could’ve increased the gap if it wasn’t for Mohamed El-Shennawy’s heroic performance.
