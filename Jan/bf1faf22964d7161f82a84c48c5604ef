The uncertainty over the national convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) persists. A meeting of governors elected on the platform of the party slated for Sunday purportedly to decide the convention date will no longer be held, it was learnt on Saturday. The Nation gathered in Abuja on Saturday that no formal meeting of the Progressive Governors’ Forum (PGF) was called for Sunday. President Muhammadu Buhari had warned that any further delay in conducting the APC national convention may render the ruling party vulnerable for defeat in 2023. Plateau State Governor and Chairman of the Northern Governors Forum, Simon Lalong, after he met with President Buhari on Friday, hinted that APC governors would meet on Sunday. - Advertisement - But a source at the coordinating Secretariat of the PGF in Abuja, where notice of meetings to member governors are issued, said he was unaware of any meeting planned for Sunday.
