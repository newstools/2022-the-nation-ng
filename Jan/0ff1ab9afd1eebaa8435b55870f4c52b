Tricycles operators in Onitsha, Anambra State on Saturday protested alleged stabbing of one of their members by suspected revenue operator in the State. The protesters, under the aegis of Tricycle Owner Association of Nigeria (TOAN), also protested collection of illegal levies from their members. They blocked major roads in the commercial city, forcing resident and traders from within and outside the state who were in the town to transact one business or another to trek long distances. Addressing reporters, spokesman and one of the protest Coordinators, David Emmanuel said the tricyclists went home daily with nothing while the revenue agents who claim to work for government smile to the banks. He said: “We spend between N4,500 N8,000 on the revenue collectors apart from the N350 daily dues we pay to the government.

We’ve complained to Ministry of Transport and our State Chairman, Comrade Sylvester Obiora but none yielded any result. Reacting, State Media Coordinator of TOAN, Uzir A.Uzir, confirmed that the protesters were their members and have been lamenting intimidation and harassment by legal and illegal revenue agents. “The TOAN chairman has constituted a tax force committee to stop the extortions the members have been going through. “We’re aware of the activities of the woman operating a team of revenue collector at Savoy area of Awka road, we are monitoring her and her agents, they will soon be apprehended,’ he said.
