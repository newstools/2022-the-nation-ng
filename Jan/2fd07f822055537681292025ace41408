Gunmen on Thursday night invaded two communities, Tungan Bako and Kawo in Rafi Local Government Area of Niger State, killing two people and abducting more than 100 others. It was learnt that the attack, which occurred simultaneously in the two communities, began at about 11 pm and lasted until 3.30 am on Friday. Some residents in Kawo community who succeeded in escaping the onslaught of the gunmen said the number of the gunmen could not be ascertained as they came in about 30 motorcycles as some had two people on their motorcycles while others had three. The residents who fled Kawo said that majority of those abducted were women and their children, adding that the two who were killed were those who were not fortunate to escape alive as they were shot when they tried to escape.

Another resident who pleaded anonymity said: “They have called us that we should bring N70 million as ransom before the people can be released. That is all I can say for now,” he added. Efforts made to get the Niger State Police Command to speak on the efforts made to rescue the victims yielded no result as the state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Wasiu Abiodun, neither picked his calls nor replied to the messages sent to his phone.
