Super Eagles right-back Ola Aina has explained circumstances that led to him giving away a penalty against Sudan in Saturday’s AFCON 2021 Group D game. With the Eagles comfortably ahead 3-0 Sudan were awarded a penalty after Aina was adjudged to have fouled an opponent following consultation with VAR. The penalty was converted which saw the Eagles lose their clean sheet in the tournament. And speaking about the spot-kick, Aina told NFF TV: ”We gave away the clean sheet it’s sad for the team, the defence and it’s sad for Madu (Okoye) because he’s been keeping a clean sheet. “What happened was that I wasn’t looking at the player obviously I held his shirt a little bit but there’s a little bit of shirt holding in the box.

Even when they scored I still thought we were in control of the game so we are lucky for that. “I understand why they gave it as a penalty but also the ball was nowhere near me or the guy I don’t understand how it could be a penalty but in that same instance I understand why they gave the penalty because obviously what has been done.” With the Eagles already through to the round of 16, it is expected interim coach Austin Eguavoen will rest some of his regulars against Guinea-Bissau on Wednesday in their final group game. But Aina said Nigerians should expect the same determination to win in order to pass a message to the rest of the teams in the competition. He added: ”Nigerians should expect the same determination. We have to go into the game with confidence and believe that we can get another three points and send signals out to the competition.”
