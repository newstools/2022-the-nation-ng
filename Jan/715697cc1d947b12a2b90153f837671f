The Coalition of Civil Society Groups has urged political parties to zone their presidential ticket to the South in the spirit of fairness and equity. The coalition said the North has had its fair share of the nation’s leadership and should, therefore, yield the presidency to the South. President of the coalition, Bassey Williams, who was flanked by the members of the groups, said this during a press conference in Abuja on Friday. Williams said the coalition had been mobilising young Nigerians to collect their Permanent Voter Cards ahead of the 2023 general elections.

National interest must override the personal interest of those pushing the parties to jettison the conventional rotation agenda on the Presidency,” he said. The group noted that the nation was already overwhelmed by insecurity and other social and economic challenges, adding that efforts should be made not to compound her woes.
