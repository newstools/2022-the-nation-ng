Official full-year trading report released by the Nigerian Exchange (NGX) at the weekend showed that total transactions at the equities market declined from N2.168 trillion in 2020 to N1.899 trillion in 2021.

Domestic institutional investors remained upbeat about the market, with institutional investors increasing their participation in the equities market. Domestic institutional trading rose from N820.14 billion in 2020 to N886.61 billion in 2021, underlining the increasing inflows of pension funds into the stock market.

Most market pundits have predicted continuing rally at the stock market, despite emerging political risks. President, Chartered Institute of Stockbrokers (CIS), Mr Olatunde Amolegbe, said two years of positive returns show that the market is reflecting its function as the barometer for the economy. “We also expect the positive movement for the first half of 2022 on the back of good corporate performance, implementation of some part of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) and intense focus on infrastructural development and resultant increased capital raising by government and corporate entities,” Amolegbe said. According to him, the implementation of the PIA has potential to raise government revenue, which may elicit a positive response from the market while infrastructural development would likely boost market activity. “These however depend on stable macroeconomic policy, increased security and stable polity,” Amolegbe, who doubles as Managing Director of Arthur Steven Asset Management Limited said. Managing Director, APT Securities and Funds, Mallam Kasimu Garba Kurfi also said the market would remain positive in 2022, although the second half would be determined by the politics of succession by the largest political parties. “We expect the bullish rally to continue in first and second quarters but the continuity to the third and fourth quarters depends on the outcome of the primary election of the APC and PDP if they are able to succeed in electing the right candidates for the presidency. Acceptability will lead to bullish rally throughout the year, otherwise, the market may suffer a reversal,” Kurfi said. Group Head, Research, GTI Capital Group, Mr. Emmanuel Onoja, said there was strong possibility of the market running through a third positive year. “It’s most likely we see a third year of positive return given the potential liquidity buildup next year as a result of increased borrowing, election spending and falling yields,” Onoja said.
