He performed excellently as Chairman of United African Company (UAC), a vast Nigerian conglomerate. Indeed, were the circumstances of his ascension to the top position in our country different, I have little doubt that Chief Shonekan would have led Nigeria with the same vision and skill with which he guided UAC. “He had the character, competence, capability and the technical background to undertake the job. In his brief time as Head of State, Chief Shonekan tried his best to advance peace, stability and development in Nigeria. - Advertisement - “Chief Shonekan will be remembered as a peacemaker and Head of State who took office at a most difficult time. I commiserate with his immediate family, most especially his loving wife, Mrs. Margret, Governor Dapo Abiodun and all the people of Ogun State and Nigeria.”
