Kano State Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje is insisting that the alleged killer of Hanifa Abubakar, a five-year-old pupil of Noble Kids Academy, must be punished in accordance with the murder and anti-kidnapping laws of the state. Hanifa’s killing has elicited outrage throughout the country. Governor Ganduje is among many Nigerians who have been outraged by the killing of the minor by her 30-year-old teacher Abdulmalik Mohammed Tanko who is the proprietor of her school. The culprit was charged to court for alleged homicide, following his confession that he used rat poison to kill the victim, after collecting a ransom of N100, 000 from her parents. Ganduje, who said he is waiting to sign the suspect’s death penalty, also yesterday assured Nigerians of “diligent scrutiny of schools for maximum security.” He has also withdrawn the operational licences of the deceased’s school which has been burnt down by angry youths.
