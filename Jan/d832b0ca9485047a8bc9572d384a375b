Juventus have agreed a €75 million (£63m/$85m) deal with Fiorentina for striker Dusan Vlahovic, GOAL can confirm. The 21-year-old is perhaps the biggest attacking name available on the market this month with Arsenal also interested in the highly-rated Serbia international. Vlahovic has scored 17 Serie A goals this season, after registering 21 efforts in the Italian top flight during the 2020-21 campaign, and has been attracting admiring glances from across Europe. Juventus have been keen to land Vlahovic in January, rather than waiting until the summer, and have agreed a €75m fee with their Serie A rivals. Indeed, the Serbian forward has opted against committing to a contract extension in Florence, forcing his current club to open themselves up to offers in the present.

Prior to the deal being agreed, Prade told Sky Sport Italia: “He has a significant valuation, above 70 million euros, with no players in exchange or payments spread over years. “We received some very substantial offers, but we never got a response from his representatives. “Our doors are open. I say this because we want to understand what he wants and what his agents want. We are also open to sitting down again to discuss a contract renewal. “We are a club with an annual turnover of 75 million euros per year, so we cannot lose Dusan for nothing.” Goal
