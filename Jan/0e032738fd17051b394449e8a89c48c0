Wahbi Khazri had a second-half penalty kick saved as Tunisia fell to a contentious 0-1 loss to Mali in their 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) opening match on Wednesday. But the Group F match in Limbe was one in which referee Janny Sikazwe was at the centre of controversy. Sikazwe awarded both sides a penalty kick in the second half and dismissed Mali forward El Bilal Toure before blowing for full-time early to spark angry scenes at Stade Limbe. After a low-key first half that saw neither side go particularly close, Ibrahima Kone converted past debutant goalkeeper Bechir Ben Said from 12 yards. This was after Ellyes Skhiri blocked Boubakar Kouyate’s shot with his hand.

They are expected to win the top two spots ahead of Gambia and Mauritania. But the 2004 tournament winners were given a lifeline 16 minutes from time when Sikazwe again pointed to the penalty kick spot when Khazri’s cross hit Moussa Djenepo on the hand. But the Saint-Etienne striker’s penalty kick was saved by Mounkoro. After the referee initially blew for full-time in the 85th minute, play resumed and Mali substitute Toure was shown a straight red card for catching Dylan Bronn late on. Sikazwe again brought play to a halt 10 seconds early in spite of a raft of substitutions and a cooling break.(dpa/NAN)
