Benue State Deputy Governor Benson Abounu on Saturday visited the Obaganya-Otukpo family house of Mr Ikwuatyum Ochoche, the senior secondary school teacher of Jesus College, Otukpo, who lost three of his four children in an inferno that destroyed his entire residence at the College shortly before Christmas. The strange fire started in the night when the family members were fast asleep. The 4th child survived the incident because he is in another school. Abounu, who was accompanied by his aides, consoled Mr Ochoche who sustained serious injuries while trying to rescue his children from the fire.   ‘Govt never told states to enforce compulsory vaccination of…     Zamfara killings: Buhari committed to crushing banditry,…     Fed Govt accuses politician of fueling boundary disputes   He called on him and his wife, who were the only ones that survived the midnight fire to look up to God for comfort and strength as no one else can comfort them. - Advertisement - Mr Ochoche thanked the deputy governor for identifying with him and his wife in their hour of sorrow and for visiting them despite his busy schedule. He said it was tough as he helplessly watched his three children consumed by a midnight fire, even as he said he has no choice but to look up to God for comfort. He prayed to God to bless Abounu and his family. Abounu, thereafter, proceeded to the school compound, where he was taken around the burnt building to have first-hand knowledge of the extent of the damage.
