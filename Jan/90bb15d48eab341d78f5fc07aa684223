It was held every Friday/Saturday night at the School hostel and I was lucky to be among a music group where we practiced a lot of songs to sing at the Friday/Saturday social night event. Luckily for me, students started voting for me as one of their favourite. To whom much is given, much is expected, so I spend most of my free time thinking and working on what to sing next at the Social Night event.” Paul hinted that plans for the label this year will include a visual of one of his songs as a surprise for his fans which would follow other yet-to-be-announced-positive projects. He also plans to sign artists who are confident in their songs, open-minded, and willing to grow and improve their craft in addition to having zeal and commitment.
