Real Madrid’s 15-game unbeaten run came to an end yesterday as they suffered a shock 1-0 loss at relegation-battling Getafe in La Liga. Madrid’s surprise defeat gives fresh hope to the beleaguered chasing pack in Spain, after Eder Militao’s early error allowed Enes Unal to score the winner at the Coliseum Alfonso Perez. Madrid have taken command of the Spanish title race after a superb run of form that included 10 consecutive wins and 15 matches without defeat, their last loss coming at Espanyol on October 3. But Carlo Ancelotti’s side were woefully out of sorts in their first outing of 2022 and, aside from a brief spell in the first half, struggled really even to threaten the Getafe goal. Eden Hazard came on at halftime but again failed to shake his team into life while Karim Benzema was unusually quiet up front. Madrid certainly missed the penetration of Vinicius Junior, who was absent after testing positive for Covid-19. - Advertisement - Ancelotti’s mood was summed up in the second half when the deflated Italian on the bench slumped over and dropped his head after a Toni Kroos free-kick drifted harmlessly out of play. Getafe lost eight games in a row earlier in the season but came in on the back of an upturn in form under Quique Sanchez Flores, having gone five games unbeaten, including a pair of wins over Cadiz and Osasuna.   RESULTS     Marylove wins maiden Abuja Tennis Cup     Ighalo grabs match winner in seven-goal thriller     Messi tests positive for Covid   SPAIN Getafe 1-0 Real Madrid Atletic0 1-0 Vallecano Elche 0-0 Granada ENGLAND Brentford 2 -1 Aston Villa Everton 2-3 Brighton Leeds 3-1 Burnley Chelsea 2-2 Liverpool
