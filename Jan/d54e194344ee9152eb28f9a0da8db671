Scottish champions Glasgow Rangers are ecstatic as playmaker Joe Aribo will be available for their high profile Old Firm derby against Celtic next week. Rangers hope that Aribo’s early return to Glasgow from the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) will provide Ibrox boss Giovanni van Bronckhorst a major boost, with the midfielder set to arrive back in time for the Scottish Premiership’s crucial top-of-the-table meeting on Wednesday.

The former Charlton Athletic youngster has been sensational for Rangers this season. He is arguably the team’s best player and signs are that the Dutchman is getting even more out of him. Aribo’s skills and touch have been evident since the moment Steven Gerrard signed him but his strength, overall play and importance to the group has been gathering week on week.
