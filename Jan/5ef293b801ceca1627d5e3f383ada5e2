Some of them are married with kids, some lecturers, some working in big offices. “For them to realise that we did something in their lives is worth thanking God for. I am so happy for this honour and pray God to bless them.” Earlier in his lecture titled, “Return, Reunite and Reflect”, Guest speaker, Prof. Ken Nwaogu, charged members to always reflect on the school’s motto, “Bonitas Disciplina Scientia” meaning Goodness, Discipline and Knowledge. “It is a great thing passing through Christ the King College and Christ the King College passing through me. The foundation of my life was laid at CKC and that foundation is what is sustaining not just me but all of you gathered here,” he said. The event provided opportunity for the old students to reflect on how fair life has been to them two decades after leaving the college as well as discuss the state of the nation.
