Ex-Nigerian international, Waidi Akanni, on Thursday urged Austin Eguavoen, the Interim Manager of the Super Eagles, to stick to his line up in the opening match in the round of 16 of the 2021 Cameroon Nations Cup. Akanni made the suggestion in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos. “We are so proud of our performance, it’s no fluke. Super Eagles are soaring again, I strongly believe in the ability of the coach and the dedication and determination of the boys. “I’d suggest that we stick to line up in the opening match against Egypt, I strongly believe that the line up is the best, every player in the first match was outstanding. “I believe with this and slight adjustment here and there, which depends on the style of play of our opponents, we will come scale through this round effortlessly,” he said. - Advertisement -   AFCON 2021: Eagles` confidence growing with each game…     Why would you take me off?!’ – Ronaldo fumes…     Alaafin, Ooni endorse lawmaker’s peace tour   The Super Eagles maintained their winning streak at the ongoing African Cup of Nations (AFCON) defeating Guinea Bissau 2-0 in their last Group D match of the competition. Sadiq Umar and Captain William Troost-Ekong gave the three-time champions the 100 per cent scorecard in the group stage. Akanni also advised that team’s substitutions should be used tactically in case of penalties. “Knock out stages are differently approached sine there must be a winner henceforth. Our team shouldn’t be over confident having won all the 3 games of preliminary. “Secondly team subs must be used tactically so that in case of penalty shoot out we will have the best results. But l am confident Eguavoen and his boys will do well round of 16,” the former Lagos State FA Chairman said. NAN reports that Nigeria with nine points alongside Egypt with seven points will proceed to the next round. (NAN)
