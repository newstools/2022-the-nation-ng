The Cameroonian government has expressed desire to improve access after the deadly stampede that killed eight people at the Africa Cup of Nations on Monday. The government’s Minister of Communication, Rene Emmanuel Sadi, told CRTV and state-owned newspaper Cameroon Tribune yesterday. A crush outside Olembe Stadium in Yaounde left at least eight people dead and more than 35 injured. “We are going to try to see if it is not possible to use other routes which would serve Olembe so that everyone does not use the same route,” Sadi said.

CAF President Patrice Motsepe has demanded that the first conclusions of the investigation should be submitted to CAF by Friday at the latest. The quarter-final that was due to be played at the Olembe Stadium was switched to the Ahmadou Ahidjo Stadium, also in Yaounde. “The next match that was scheduled for the Olembe Stadium will not take place until CAF and the Local Organising Committee have received the full report of the Investigation Committee (into the Olembe incident) indicating the circumstances and events that led to the injury and death of spectators at the Olembe Stadium,” CAF said in a statement on Wednesday.
