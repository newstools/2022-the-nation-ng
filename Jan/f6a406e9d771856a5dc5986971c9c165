Some residents of Opukushi in Ekeremor Local Government of Bayelsa State have disrupted oil exploration at an oilfield operated by Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) in the area. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) learnt that the communities hosting SPDC’s EA fields took the action to protest alleged exclusion from contracts in the ongoing oil drilling. The Chairman of Opukushi Community Development Committee, Chief Preye Simon, told NAN that the people took the action to draw attention to their plight. He alleged that rather than engaging the people in the ongoing activities at the field, SPDC and its servicing contractors neglected their social obligations to the communities. According to him, the exclusion of the people from the drilling contracts was in violation of the Community Content Guidelines.
