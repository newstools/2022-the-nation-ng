Insigne, who has played his entire senior career with his local team, smashed home from the penalty spot in the minute to move level with legend Maradona in the club’s scoring charts. His strike made sure of a win over regional rivals Salernitana, who were hit by Covid-19 cases, which moves Napoli second and keeps them four points behind league leaders Inter. The 30-year-old’s penalty was his fifth goal of the Serie A campaign and the second spot-kick of the game after Mertens had put Napoli ahead for the second time on the stroke of half-time with his club record-extending 144th goal.
