We had a controlled landing in Bauchi. The chopper departed Abuja and got into Bauchi at about 7am on Thursday. “And incidentally the runway lights were off. So visibility was an issue. They hovered around the airport hoping that somebody would turn-on the light. “They tried to reach them on the communication set, nobody was on the control towel and at the end of the day they had no choice but to do a control landing. And they landed safely. “The only thing that happened is that very close to where they landed the tail rotor hit a branch of a tree. So the only damage they had was to the tail rotor. “And there were six persons onboard and nobody was injured. And there was no major damage to the plane”.
