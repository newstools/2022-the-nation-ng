A Catholic cleric, Rev. Fr. Humpherey Nwojoko, has paid examination fees for the Senior School Certificate Examination (SSCE) conducted by the West African Examinations Council (WAEC) and National Examination Council (NECO) for 12 pupils of the Holy Trinity Parish Umudike Ukpor. Father Nwojoko, who is the Parish Priest of the church in Nnewi South Local Goverment Area of Anambra State, said he was moved to pay the fees after a ‘42-day prayers’ recently concluded in the parish. Handing over envelopes containing the cash to the beneficiaries, Nwojoko charged them to face their studies squarely so as to come out in flying colors to enable them contribute their quota for nation building in the nearest future. He said, “During last Sunday Ministration, I announced that parishioners who are to sit for the WAEC and NECO exams should come for special prayers for them.

One of them, Miss Chinecherem Ikwueme, who disclosed she had ambition of studying Law, however, noted that her parents lacked the resources to sponsor her. “I thank Fr Nwojoko for his show of love, at least, I am sure of writing my WAEC now, after which I will look unto God for more help on the course I desire to pursue in the university,” she said.
