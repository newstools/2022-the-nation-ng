Kelechi Nwakali has promised to give it all for the Super Eagles at the African Cup of Nations in Cameroon (AFCON) despite his late inclusion into the national team set-up. Speaking to NFF TV, the SD Huesca of Spain midfielder, whose only cap for Nigeria was a friendly game a second-string Super Eagles team played against Atlético Madrid of Spain at the Godswill Akpabio International Stadium in 2018, revealed that he had morale-boosting talks from some ex-internationals like Nwankwo Kanu, Obinna Nsofor and Emmanuel Amuneke who advised him to work harder, encouraging that his time with the national team will come. “I will always make sure I represent Nigeria very well and then for all the people that have stood by me, encouraging me saying that you are not there yet in the Super Eagles but you just need to keep working until the time comes. “I remember I spoke to some ex-Super Eagles players I am in contact with, sometimes I speak to Kanu, and I speak to Obinna Nsofor, Emmanuel Amuneke who is my coach.   “33” Export Lager Unveils Okocha as Ambassador     Garba tips Awoniyi to shine at Cameroon 2021 AFCON     CAMEROON 2-1 BURKINA FASO: Indomitable Lions off to winning…   “They said I am not there yet but I am going to be there if I keep working hard if I believe in myself and that is what happened.
