FORMER Super Eagles defender, Bright Omokaro, has charged the Austin Eguavoen- led squad to be as aggressive as ever if they hope to tame Sudan in Sunday’s match. Omokaro who is optimistic of Super Eagles victory, hinted that records have shown that the Sudanese are known for playing aggressive football.

I’m very happy for our boys. They started the Nations Cup campaign on a sound note, beating the highly rated Egypt side is highly commendable. I just want them to keep that winning spirit on.  Every progressive Nigeria want our national team to succeed. So if you ask my opinion I simply say that Eagles will overrun Sudan if they can be aggressive. The Sudanese I know very well play aggressive football, they can also play the spoiler role because they know that they do not have what it takes to beat Super Eagles.” “I’m also very happy with the seriousness and commitment of the players. They are battle ready to prove a point,” he added.
