He said: “At our inaugural press conference in 2012, we stated that the Nigeria Pitch Awards platform would offer Nigerians more than awards to deserving footballers. “In continuing with this vision to offer more to improve sports in Nigeria, we are pleased to announce an annual symposium on sports. “ The symposium which will precede the annual Award Ceremony will attract local and international speakers. Our vision is to make the gathering a unique opportunity to renew and re-focus national attention on sports in Nigeria and open up avenues for administrators to harness the opportunities sports provide. We will outline more details of this project in the coming months.   LIST OF NOMINEES Goalkeeper of the Year Daniel Akpeyi – Super Eagles & Kaizer Chiefs John Noble – Super Eagles & Enyimba FC Maduka Emilio Okoye – Super Eagles & Sparta Rotterdam FC   Defender of the Year Olisa Ndah – Super Eagles & Orlando Pirates FC William Troost-Ekong – Super Eagles & Watford FC Leon Balogun – Super Eagles & Rangers FC   Midfielder of the Year Joe Aribo – Super Eagles & Rangers FC Frank Onyeka – Super Eagles & Brentford FC Wilfred Ndidi – Super Eagles & Leicester City FC   Striker of the Year Kelechi Iheanacho – Super Eagles & Leicester City FC Victor Osimhen – Super Eagles & Napoli FC Paul Onuachu – Super Eagles & KRC Genk   Team of the Year Bayelsa United Rivers United Akwa United   Coach of the Year Diepreye Teibowei – Bayelsa United Edwin Okon – Rivers Angels FC Kennedy Boboye – Akwa United   Sam Okwaraji Award Victor Osimhen – Super Eagles & Napoli FC Seyi Akinwunmi – First Vice President, NFF   BREAKING: Super Eagles arrive in Garoua     Eguavoen banks  on Awoniyi, Olayinka for goals     Sirawoo  rallies  media practitioners  behind  sports   Asisat Oshoala – Super Eagles & FC Barcelona Femini   State with the Best Grassroots Football Development Programme Edo State Lagos State Delta State   Football Friendly Governor of the Year His Excellency, Babajide Sanwo-Olu – Lagos State His Excellency, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa – Delta State His Excellency Nyesom Wike CON – Rivers State   Football Pitch of the Year Award Godswill Akpabio Stadium – Uyo Mobolaji Johnson Stadium – Onikan Teslim Balogun Stadium – Surulere   Corporate Sponsor of Football Award Air Peace – Aviation MTN – Telecommunications AITEO Group – Oil & Gas   Football Journalist of the Year Award – Print Charles Diya – The New Telegraph Kelvin Ekerete – Punch Newspapers Johnny Edwards – Punch Newspapers   Football Journalist of the Year Award – Radio Emmanuel Etim – Nigeria Info FM Tony Bekederemo – Sports Radio 88.9 Brila FM Olawale Adigun – Top Radio 90.9 FM   Football Journalist of the Year Award – TV Chisom Mbonu-Ezeoke – SuperSport Miyen Akiri – TVC Cecilia Omorogbe – Channels TV   Football Journalist of the Year Award – Online Fisayo Dairo – ACL Sports Shina Oludare – Goal.com Tobi Samuel Adepoju – Oganlamedia   Queen of the Pitch Gift Monday – Super Falcons & FC Robo/Rivers Angels Asisat Oshoala Super Eagles & FC Barcelona Femini Uchenna Kalu – Super Eagles & Linkopings FC   King of the Pitch Victor Osimhen – Super Eagles & Napoli FC Wilfred Ndidi – Super Eagles & Leicester City FC Paul Onuachu – Super Eagles & KRC Genk
