A football administrator, Ebere Amaraizu, says it is painful that , being the best qualifiers, were edged out by the best loser of the group stage, Tunisia. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the Tunisians, in a round of 16 knock-out stage of the ongoing African Cup of Nations (AFCON), defeated the Super Eagles 1 – 0. This development, which happened on Sunday night in Garoua, Cameroon, sent the Super Eagles packing from the competition. Amaraizu, who is a director in the Nigeria Nationwide League One (NLO), told NAN on Monday in Enugu that millions of Nigerians, especially football lovers, are still in shock over the unexpected development.
