Liverpool star Sadio Mane insisted he was doing fine despite being taken to hospital after suffering concussion during Senegal’s victory over Cape Verde at the Africa Cup of Nations. There was concern for Mane after he clashed heads with Cape Verde goalkeeper Vozinha, with the latter sent off for his part in the incident. Mane required treatment but was surprisingly allowed to carry on and shortly after curled home Senegal’s opener in the last-16 match in Bafoussam. But the 29-year-old, who appeared to be knocked out during the clash of heads, went down to the ground after celebrating his goal and was then subbed off.

Mane has scored 10 goals in 26 appearances for Liverpool this season to help Jurgen Klopp’s side climb to second in the Premier League and qualify for the Champions League knockout stages.
