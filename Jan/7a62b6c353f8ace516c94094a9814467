Leeds United on Sunday won West Ham United 3-2 at London Stadium. Jack Harrison scored his first career hat-trick as Leeds United avenged last week’s FA Cup defeat with a thrilling Premier League victory over West Ham at London Stadium. The visitors, who lost 2-0 seven days ago, were pegged back twice before Harrison scored the pick of his three goals with a neat chip over Lukasz Fabianski as Leeds made it consecutive league wins for the first time this season. Harrison opened the scoring with a fierce strike in the 10th minute but West Ham recovered from their lacklustre start to equalise through the in-form Jarrod Bowen. Leeds took the lead again before the interval as Harrison sneaked in at the back post to convert off his thigh from Luke Ayling’s downward header following a corner.

Bowen, who had earlier scored his fourth goal in three games, missed a golden chance in the final seconds to draw the hosts level as he could only chest the ball over the bar from a few yards when unmarked. That came after both sides had goals ruled out as first, Mateusz Klich’s effort was crossed off as it brushed an offside Rodrigo on its way in, before Andriy Yarmolenko’s header was deemed offside too.   BBC Sport
