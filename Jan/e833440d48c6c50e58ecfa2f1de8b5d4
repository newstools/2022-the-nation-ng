On Wednesday, soldiers from the 32 Artillery Brigade of the Nigerian Army, Akure, Ondo State, arrested 150 political thugs at Ita Awure/Efon Junction in Efon Alaaye in Ekiti State. This happened on the day the PDP was holding its gubernatorial primary election to nominate the party’s governorship candidate for the 2022 gubernatorial election. It was also barely 24 hours before the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) was billed to conduct its own primary election in the same state. Sentry gathered that the political thugs were heading to Ado-Ekiti, the state capital. There have been divergent claims on where they were coming from. While some reports claim they took off from Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, others say they were from neighbouring Ondo State. Some social media posts even suggested they were from Lagos State.   2023 zoning intrigues deepen in APC, PDP     Supreme Court delaying resolution of VAT dispute, says Wike     Enugu 2023 and Ugwuanyi’s dilemma   But one thing that’s not in dispute is the destination of the heavily armed thugs; they were headed to Ado-Ekiti, where the primaries of some of the political parties ahead of the state governorship election, were holding. The suspects were all taken to Owen Barracks in Akure for further investigation. They are to be handed over to the Police for prosecution afterwards. But one question that remains unanswered and may remain so unless the matter and suspects are diligently prosecuted is the identity of the person or persons who solicited their violent services in Ado-Ekiti. No doubt, they were on an errand for a politician, group or even party; but who exactly? Not a few Nigerians are waiting eagerly for this all important answer.
