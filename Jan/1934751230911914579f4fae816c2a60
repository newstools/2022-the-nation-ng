A political scientist and philanthropist, Hon. Mkpa Oju Uka has expressed disappointment with the decision of the Senator representing Abia South Senatorial District, Sen. Enyinnaya Abaribe to join the governorship race in 2023, saying that it is joke. Uka speaking to journalists in Umuahia, the state capital said that. Abaribe’s decision to run for the office of the governor in 2023 runs contrary to the existing Abia State Charter of Equity, which he says allows rotational governorship. According to Uka, Sen. Abaribe, a former deputy governor in the state cannot be clamouring for the southeast to be allowed to rule the country in 2023 and at the same time undermine an existing arrangement that allows power to rotate around the three geopolitical zones in the state. He said Abaribe has remained a diehard supporter and advocate of rotational leadership in the state and national level and wondered why he (Abaribe) decided to join the race when his Abia South Senatorial District at the moment holds the governorship position.

You are clamouring for a zoning system for the South-East to be given an opportunity and it can be you. “In the other way, even if they don’t, you may be the Vice President and you have the capacity to be one. “Then you’re coming back to your state and you are now abandoning the zoning system, the equity system which you have spoken many times passionately about as a Senator. “That is unbelievable, that you can be advocating for one thing at the national level and going contrary to the same thing at the state level. So it’s a joke” he said.
