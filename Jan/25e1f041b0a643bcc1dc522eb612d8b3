WATFORD have sacked Claudio Ranieri after their dismal defeat to relegation rivals Norwich on Friday. Josh Sargent’s double and an own goal from Juraj Kucka condemned the Hornets to a seventh Premier League defeat from their last eight matches. The result also led to the Canaries overtaking Watford to leave them in the bottom three for the first time this term. The Vicarage Road outfit are without a win since beating Manchester United 4-1 in November. Now the 70-year-old, who previously managed Chelsea and led Leicester to their odds-defying Prem title success in 2016, has paid the price after just three months in charge. - Advertisement - Ranieri was given a two-year contract back in October when he replaced Xisco Munoz.
