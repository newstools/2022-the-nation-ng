The Nigerian Armed Forces Resettlement Centre (NAFRC) Oshodi has commenced a three-month pre-retirement training for 326 non-commissioned officers (NCOs) drawn from the Army, Navy and Air Force. The training, according to NAFRC Commandant, Air Vice Marshal (AVM) Idi Gamso Lubo, was designed to prepare the personnel for life after service. He urged them to take full advantage of the vocational skills and management courses offered at the centre to develop the capacity needed in their desired entrepreneurial field. Lubo noted that transition to civil life after 35 years of service in the military was a difficult phase, adding that to make it easier, a counselling department with skilled professionals have been provided to cater to the trainees’ mental health and ensure a smooth transition.

Lubo said his administration would work to ensure a conducive learning environment, adding that the trainees should not hesitate to inform the appropriate channels of any issue that may hinder the progress of the course. Director of Training, Brig.-Gen. Marcel Ejike admonished the trainees to maintain a high level of discipline and follow due process in obtaining passes whenever there was a need to go out of the center. He also advised them to take advantage of the learning equipment and material for self-development.
