Super Eagles interim manager, Austin Eguavoen has said that he would be banking on the trio of Odion Ighalo, Taiwo Awoniyi, and Peter Olayinka for  goals that will help Nigeria progress to the second round of the 2021 AFCON in Cameroon. With the absence of Eagles goal poacher Victor Osimhen, Eguavoen said that the goal-scoring responsibility now rests on the three players and other attack-minded players in the team as the team hunts for their fourth AFCON title. “With the injury to Victor Osimhen, we have other strikers that can step up and get us the goals. Odion Ighalo whom we are hopeful will still join us. Taiwo Awoniyi and Peter Olayinka are two other strikers that can help too,” Eguavoen said. “We also have other attack-minded players like Chidera Ejuke, Umar Sadiq, and others. We shall experiment with what we have to get the result we desire,” he added.
