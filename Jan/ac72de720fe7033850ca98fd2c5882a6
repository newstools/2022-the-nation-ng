Former Senator representing Kaduna Central Senatorial District Shehu Sani has called for a strategic framework aimed at deepening mutual understanding between Nigerians and South Africans. Sani, who gave the advice in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja, said the mutual understanding that would be developed should help end the killing of Nigerians living and doing business in the southern African country. The senator, a former Vice Chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs in the 8th Senate, was speaking against the backdrop of concerns over the alarming rise in the killing of Nigerians in that country. According to him, since the collapse of apartheid, Nigeria has not been able to harness its investment via the interventions it brought to bear in that country. “There must be a strategy by which the economies of Nigeria and South Africa, the brotherhood, and the relations between the two countries will be strengthened for mutual economic benefits.
