Collins and Cornelius, the twin brothers who incidentally caught the jackets of Peter and Paul Okoye of PSquare, have finally had a chance to meet their music icons. In December 2020, during their performance at the PSquare reactivated concert which held at Livespot, the singers threw their jackets into the crowd and their fans who happened to be a set of twins caught them. The twins, who are also musicians and go by the name Dcee Wonderboys, were extremely ecstatic grabbing the Okoye twins’ jackets in the midst of many. They considered the occasion a blessing as they hoped to see their mentors soonest.

We caught both jackets @iamkingrudy @peterpsquare. This is blessing to us.” And their belief may just be working it out for them as they recently met with Rudeboy and they expressed immense joy at finally set eyes on one of their idols. They posted a video of their meeting with father of three in his residence rocking PSquare jackets as they discussed away and posed for some photo shots while they appreciated ‘agent eepee’ for the role he played in making the meeting possible. They captioned post: “Finally get to meet with our greatest mentor we are super grateful thank you for honouring our visit @iamkingrudy @peterpsquare. “Special thanks to @agentteepee.”
