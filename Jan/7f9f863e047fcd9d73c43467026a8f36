Delectable theatre practitioner, Chioma Odimba, made a bold statement as she interpreted the role of Donna in the FirstBank sponsored Mamma Mia: The Smash hit musical. The two-hour long show, which is woven with shades of cultural colours that  are visible in the language, gesture, costume, choreography, and characteristics, saw Odimba taking over the heart and soul of the musical. The breathless Odimba gave veteran actor, Jide Kosoko, a run for his money as a member of the 65 Nigerian cast and crew licensed adaptation of the global show. With a controlled acting and pace, Odimba’s elocution left the audience in awe of her abilities  as she sprinkles the ABBA classics with an unmatched passion while on stage. Directed by Najite Dede and executive produced by Ireti Bakare-Yusuf, Mamma Mia is an adaptation of the original musical created in 1998 by British theatre producer Judith Cramer, who engaged British playwright Catherine Johnson, to write a story woven around the multiple hit songs of Swedish pop group ABBA, composed by Bjorn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson.
