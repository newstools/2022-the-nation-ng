Manchester City took another big step towards defending their Premier League title with a battling 1-0 win over rivals Chelsea. The champions dominated for long periods but struggled to break down their compact visitors until Kevin De Bruyne broke the deadlock 20 minutes from time with a brilliant goal from the edge of the box.   Milan legend sacked as coach after 11 games     Wike to Buhari: stop Boko Haram, bandits from killing     ‘My husband murdered my three daughters to traumatise me’   Although seemingly off balance and with a pass to Raheem Sterling the obvious move, De Bruyne dug the ball out of his feet and curled a shot past the outstretched hand of Kepa Arrizabalaga. It was the Belgian’s fifth goal against Chelsea and leaves his former club 13 points behind City with just 16 games remaining.
