All Progressives Congress (APC) elders have not settled for any replacement for Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu in Lagos State, their umbrella body – Governance Advisory Council (GAC) – clarified yesterday. They condemned a post circulating through online platforms purporting that the GAC, other party leaders and stakeholders may not back the governor for a second term. GAC Secretary Mutiu Aare made the clarification in a statement yesterday in Lagos. The APC chieftain explained that the social media information was absolutely false and preposterous.

Aare said: “It is not within the realm of GAC to engage in picking replacements for a governor. Importantly, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has not signaled the commencement of the process for governorship election in Lagos State. “Governor Sanwo-Olu was elected for a four-year tenure which is still ongoing. The matter of replacement of the governor does not arise and is patently subjudice. Governor Sanwo-Olu is doing a wonderful job delivering infrastructure projects for Lagos and working daily on making the state better for all its residents. “We urge those behind this dangerous, dysfunctional and misguided post to desist forthwith.”
