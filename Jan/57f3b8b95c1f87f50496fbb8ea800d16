Dear Madam Temilolu, Happy New Year ma. I’m a 29-year-old virgin and I thought to inform you my wedding is coming up April this year. I’d like to thank you most sincerely for your teachings which have helped me since I began reading your articles about 5 years ago. I’m so happy I kept myself for the right man and I must confess you really helped me. Thanks so much ma. Paula Dear Aunty Temilolu, I must confess God is really using you ma. Many thanks and may God bless you for the good work you’re doing. It appears most of your posts about ungodly sex is referring to me as my spirit is totally against it because whenever I engage in such, in my dreams I will see myself defeated and rolling in the mud. Meanwhile, so many prophets have told me to stop it in order for God to use me mightily! Several times I have confessed and promised I will not do it anymore but find myself doing it with married man of recent and single guys. No serious relationship and I’m a 31-year-old bread winner of my family not the first nor second child. In my family nothing is working at all; we are suffering from serious poverty and I’m praying for God to use me to bring financial blessings to my family but I’m seriously battling with sexual lust and diverse sins. I always vow not to engage in it no matter the pressure but still fall victim. I have intentions to travel out and I have actually received so many prophecies about my travelling but I’m stuck right now. Please ma, I don’t know what to do I just need your counseling, thanks ma! - Advertisement - Ena Dear Ena,   North-Central youths back Saraki’s presidential…     Obi Cubana offers Lagos hawker university scholarship,…     IPOB’s peculiar hyperbole   I must say God loves you and has been revealing His plans for you through His servants despite your waywardness!

Yes! I insist too many of you don’t have the faintest idea what leaves your life during sexual intercourse- a spiritual union and    exchange!

You need to be very wise this year! And I must say time is going! What God scheduled to happen in your life/the blessings meant for last year, this year and next year may never ever come your way again if you don’t sit right and tight to have them at the appointed time!
