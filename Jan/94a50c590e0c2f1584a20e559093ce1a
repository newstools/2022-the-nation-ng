The Federal Government has amended the charge against the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) leader, Nnamdi Kanu, raising the counts from seven to 15 ahead of the resumed hearing on Tuesday. A Federal High Court in Abuja, before which Kanu had been facing a seven-count treasonable/terrorism count charge had on December 2, upon an application by his lawyer, Ifeanyi Ejiofor, rescheduled hearing in the case for January 18. But on Monday, Kanu’s legal team said it was served with an amended 15-count charge filed on January 17, adding 10 counts to the counts in the old charge. A lawyer in Kanu’s team, Maxwell Opara described the amendment as a ploy by the prosecution to clog progress in the case.
