AHEAD of the July 16 governorship election in Osun State, the Inter-Party Advisory Council, IPAC, has warned political parties not to turn the state into a political battleground. IPAC in a statement by its chairman, Mr Wale Adebayo, on Sunday in Osogbo, also called on the people of the state not to sell their destiny or mortgage their conscience for electoral porridge. IPAC urges political parties to abide by the dictates of the electoral act. “We advise all concerned to toe the path of honour and engage in the issue-based campaign and not engage in acts that will lead to the breakdown of law and order,” Adebayo said.

It is our only hope of building a strong, virile, stable, prosperous, and just society. “Any threat to the democratic process is a threat to our nationhood and existence and it must be resisted by all patriotic Osun indigenes.”
