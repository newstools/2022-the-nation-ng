It’s been a week of troubles for world number one tennis player and reigning Australian Open champion, Novak Djokovic.  The 34-year-old has been at the centre of controversy in the past weeks over his COVID-19 vaccination status.  Djokovic’s visa was first revoked shortly after his arrival in Melbourne, Australia on 6 January, after country’s Border Force officials said he had “failed to provide appropriate evidence” to receive a vaccine exemption. He was detained for hours at Melbourne airport’s immigration control, and then spent days at an immigration hotel. Djokovic’s high-powered legal team overturned the visa decision in court on a procedural matter related to his airport interview. But on Friday, the country dramatically revoked the tennis star visa for a second time under separate powers in Australia’s Migration Act.

Reacting, Chairman of Anap Foundation COVID-19 Think Tank, Atedo Peterside commended the decision of the Australian authorities. He carpeted the star for not isolating himself after testing positive for the dreaded infection. Peterside, recently tested positive despite being double-vaccinated and receiving a booster dose but he was asymptomatic. He said: “Great decision to kick Novak Djokovic out of Australia. “The excuse that his team members submitted false travel information on his behalf is laughable. So too is his failure to isolate himself after testing positive for #COVID19”
