Singer Timi Dakolo has expressed his opinion on fortune and fame. While some may presume with one comes the other, the singer argued that isn’t ever the case. According to the father of three in a post on social media, a person can be extremely famous yet broke. “You can be really famous, I mean really really famous and still be broke,” Dakolo wrote. Reacting to his post, many agreed while others noted that can happen when an individual doesn’t fully maximise their fame. - Advertisement - papiiitino said: “This is the most depressing situation possible.
