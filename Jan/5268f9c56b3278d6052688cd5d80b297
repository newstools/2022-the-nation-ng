While we knew this time would come someday, that inevitability does nothing to stem the deep sadness we feel at losing a legend,” Raymond B. King, president and CEO of Zoo Atlanta, said in the news release. Ozzie made history in 2009 after becoming the “first gorilla in the world ever to participate in a voluntary blood pressure reading,” according to the zoo. The western lowland silverback is survived by daughter Kuchi, sons Kekla, Stadi, and Charlie, granddaughter Lulu, great-granddaughter Andi, and great-grandson Floyd, all of whom live at Zoo Atlanta. He also has other children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren living at other accredited zoos in the US and Canada.
