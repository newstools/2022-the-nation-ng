Egypt head coach Carlos Queiroz has expressed his excitement ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations journey, expressing tournament-winning intentions. The Pharaohs kick-off their journey to an eighth African title today when they face Nigeria in the highlight of the AFCON day three. Many expect the game to be tricky for both sides, especially as the winner of the tie will have a huge chance of finishing top of the group and avoid a difficult match-up in the round of 16. Carlos Queiroz, who is set to take part in his second AFCON following a disappointing run with South Africa back in 2002, sent words of comfort to the fans while insisting they are targeting nothing but the title in Cameroon.  “It’s a great pleasure to face Nigeria in the opening game. We want to face the strongest teams in the tournament,” Queiroz said in his pre-match press conference. “Nigeria is a very strong team, but we have no objections. It’s always good to compete against football giants. - Advertisement - “We have a lot of players that are competing among themselves for a starting position, and that’s great because we came here to play seven games.
