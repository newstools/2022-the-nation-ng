The people of Abule-Onilu and Idowu-Egba communities in Egbe-Idimu LCDA, Alimosho Local Government Area can now heave a sigh of relief, as the council chairman, Kunle Sanyaolu Olowoopejo recently commissioned a link bridge to facilitate movement and commerce in the area. Olowoopejo said the council was moved to step in and provide real concrete bridge in place of the plank bridge that used to be there, following recent casualties recorded there. He urged the communities to own and maintain the new bridge, adding that the government has also provided solar-powered streetlights, to prevent criminals from perpetrating any kind of criminal act there. He thanked all party members, community leaders and citizens present, stressing that their support for the All Peoples Congress (APC) has not gone in vain, even as he promised more dividends of democracy in the form of people oriented projects and infrastructure.
