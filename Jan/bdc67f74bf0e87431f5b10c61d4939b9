The appointment of Senator Margaret Okadigbo as chairman of the newly-incorporated Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited by President Muhammadu Buhari is seen by many as his way of honouring his late political ally and one time running mate, Senator Chuba Okadigbo. The late colourful politician, Margaret’s husband and former Senate President, was Buhari’s running mate when the president contested on the platform of the defunct All Nigerian Peoples Party (ANPP) in 2003. Dr. Okadigbo passed on in September of the same year. Mrs. Okadigbo’s appointment came after Buhari had suspended the inauguration of the old board for reasons that were not made public. He had in September last year appointed Senator Ifeanyi Ararume as the pioneer Chairman of NNPC Limited Board.

But in November, the president directed the suspension of the inauguration of the newly constituted Board until further notice. No reason was given for the suspension. - Advertisement - Like her husband, the new NNPC chairperson successfully ran for the Senate and took her husband’s seat representing Anambra North Senatorial District after his death. While in the Senate she made her mark. Supporters and friends of late Okadigbo had been calling on Buhari to honour the memory of his late running mate. Last September, the Chuba Okadigbo Rainbow Organisation applauded Buhari for naming Mrs. Okadigbo as a member of the NNPC board. Ohanaeze Ndigbo also applauded the move. No doubt, the latest development will be a pleasant surprise for families and friends of the late politician. The president had clearly remembered his old friend and ally.
