The Guild of Sports Editors has urged the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) to without delay empower Super Eagles interim coach, Augustine Eguavoen, for the forthcoming Qatar 2022 World Cup playoff in March against the Black Stars of Ghana. The Guild noted that the time is too short for the NFF to start hiring a foreign coach for the task of qualifying Nigeria for Qatar 2022, adding Eguavoen has shown that given adequate support, he can return the Super Eagles to the summit of world football. Rising from a meeting in Lagos at the weekend, the body, which is the umbrella association of managers of sports in the country’s major media houses, said through its President Tony Ubani: “Nigerians will not forgive the NFF if it bungles the country’s bid to qualify for the World Cup. “Qualifying for the Qatar 2022 World Cup is the most important task before managers of the country’s football. They must ensure that nothing goes wrong. “The whole world saw in Cameroun that Nigeria’s problem is not hinged on lack of quality players. Rather, the country was held down by a lethargic system, which did not allow the players the opportunity to express their talents.

Time is of the essence.” The body also reminded Sports Minister, Sunday Dare, that qualifying and performing creditably at the 2022 World Cup is the biggest sports assignment facing the Federal Government this year. “The minister should, therefore, provide the enabling environment for the NFF to prepare the Super Eagles for the games against Ghana,” the body noted. “Fortunately, the Federal Government has the Moshood Abiola Stadium in Abuja back to life. There are also other quality stadiums to host the Nigerian leg of the matches, so, the focus should now be solely on preparing the national team for the matches,” the body added.
