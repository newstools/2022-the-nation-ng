The fire that has already completely destroyed South Africa’s main Parliament chamber flared up again yesterday about 36 hours after it started in the 130-year-old complex of historic buildings, authorities said. Firefighters have been sent back to the Parliament precinct in the centre of Cape Town to battle the flames that re-appeared on the roof of the main Parliament building in the late afternoon. More than 30 firefighters were battling the fire again yesterday, Cape Town Fire and Rescue Service spokesman Jermaine Carelse told the News 24 website. Before the blaze reignited, authorities had said it had been contained and had begun to assess the damage. The fire had started around 6am on Sunday morning. Still a mystery is the role of a man who has been arrested and is being questioned by police in connection with the fire.

The man is also facing charges under South Africa’s National Key Points Act, a security law that restricts access to government buildings and other places of national importance. The man, who has not been named, was arrested Sunday at the scene, authorities said. South African media reported he had to be rescued from the fire, while questions have been raised over if there was a deliberate attack on the seat of South Africa’s democracy. Extensive damage has been done to the stately white and red brick buildings in the Parliament precinct. The fire had already burned down the chamber in the National Assembly building where South African legislators meet to pass laws, Parliament said in a statement.
