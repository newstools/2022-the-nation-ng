Slavia Prague forward Peter Olayinka has described his excitement in making the Super Eagles team for the Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon. The 26-year-old was a late call-up to the Nigeria squad for the replacing Victor Osimhen who tested positive for Covid 19. He was already planning to return to his Czech Republic base after the Christmas holidays when a text message changed everything. The Slavia Prague winger and striker was added to the Super Eagles’ Africa Cup of Nations roster following the withdrawals of Napoli striker Victor Osimhen and Watford talisman Emmanuel Dennis. Prior to his unexpected call-up, Olayinka was due to fly with the Slavia Prague squad to Algarve for a training camp from 5 to 24 January 2022.

In the current season, Olayinka has scored six goals while providing two assists in 21 appearances, including seven in European competition. “I took the call and he told me I was going to AFCON. I was very happy, very surprised,” Olayinka told NFF TV. On his expectation for the AFCON, Olayinka said he would give his beat for the Super Eagles if given a chance to play at the finals. “I don’t want to put too much pressure on myself, but if given the chance to play, I can assure Nigerians I would give 100 per cent to the success of the team,” he said.
