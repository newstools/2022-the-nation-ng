So, he messaged me and wondered why I didn’t get to see him despite inviting me over. He invited me to his hotel and we hung out. I spent the night with him until the next morning.” Continuing, she said: “We kept speaking even when he invited me to Nigeria, we messed around on several occasions. I am accountable for my part. In December again, he invited me to his show and we messed around. “I know it’s wrong what I did sleeping with a married man and tried to communicate with him so we can find a way out but he kept telling me I’m trying to disgrace him. “After I left the hospital and called him, he told me to do the needful and get rid of the child after I told him I was pregnant. He said I was trying to disgrace him but I told him that we were both wrong and this is not to blackmail him as I have never asked for anything but respect because he became verbally aggressive towards me calling me a fool and an idiot.”
