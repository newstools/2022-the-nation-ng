Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami (SAN) on Tuesday said the government will soon designate bandits as terrorists. The Federal High Court in Abuja had declared bandit groups as terrorists. Speaking during a Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) programme on Tuesday, Malami said: “Government has a responsibility to act but within the context of acting, you’re equally expected to operate within the confines of international best practices associated with engagement. “One of such best practices is that you can only use maximum force on groups, individuals that are declared terrorists and that is where the application of the Terrorism Act comes in place. “Whatever military hardware you acquire, there are limits within the context of the international convention as to how it can be used, when it can be used, and against who it can be used. - Advertisement - “And that is how the idea of looking at the activities of the bandits, cattle rustlers, kidnappers come into being.
