Victor Osimhen has been given the all-clear after COVID and surgery for facial fractures, resumed training with Napoli and hopes to make his comeback against Bologna next week. The striker pulled out of international duty with Nigeria for the Africa Cup of Nations after testing positive for COVID-19 in December. It was the second year running that he had contracted the virus while visiting his homeland over the Christmas break. His participation in the tournament had also been in doubt after complex surgery on multiple facial fractures in November, caused by an accidental clash of heads with Inter defender Milan Skriniar.
