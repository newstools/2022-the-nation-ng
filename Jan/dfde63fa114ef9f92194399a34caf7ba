Super Eagles handler Austine Eguavoen has warned that the Super Eagles round of 16 fixtures against Tunisia on Sunday will be tough. The Eagles qualified for the Round of 16 with a 100 per cent record in the group stage. However, Tunisia lost two of their three group fixtures and finished as one of the third best-placed teams to qualify for the round of 16. Speaking ahead of Sunday’s knockout game, Eguavoen stated that the Eagles must be at their best to overcome the 2004 AFCON winners. “Congratulations to our team now it’s clear we are playing against Tunisia which is another North African strong team,” he said on NFF TV.   We’re determined to win fourth AFCON title, says Iwobi     Australian Open: Rafael Nadal beats Karen Khachanov to reach…     Oscar willing to take pay cut for Barca move   - Advertisement - “We will continue to work hard like we’ve always done, same approach same determination tactics might differ a little bit so we are ready. “Yesterday (Thursday) we did a little bit of recovery training so today (Friday) we will start on how to approach Tunisia. “They (Tunisia) had ups and downs in their first game which ended in dramatic fashion, they’ve lost two penalties, lost two games as well in open play, yesterday they lost narrowly towards the end of the game. “For them having qualified for the knockout stage its going to be a different ball game because round of 16 if you don’t get it you are off and if you get it you are through to the quarter-finals. “It’s going to be a very different game because they are technically very good and they are fast as well, typical North African team. So we will find a way to see how to counter them and come top at the end of the day.”
