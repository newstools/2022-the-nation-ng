Feelers from Ekiti State, where governorship election will be taking place later this year suggest that Governor Kayode Fayemi may be tired of the lingering ‘civil war’ within his ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Sentry gathered that governor is now reaching out to stakeholders on how peace can return to the troubled party in time for it to win the all-important gubernatorial election. “Fayemi wants to ensure that the man who takes over from him is not from the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). He understands how dangerous that is for him,” a source said on Thursday, adding that “the governor, as the leader of the party is finally doing the right thing.” As part of his quest for a united APC in Ekiti, he met APC National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, during the week.

Ekiti APC will benefit more from being united,’ he said. Fayemi is believed to be backing the aspiration of the immediate past Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Biodun Oyebanji, while the Adegeye group is supporting Senator Opeyemi Bamidele’s gubernatorial aspiration, all within the APC. It is left to be seen whether Fayemi’s latest moves bring succor to the troubled party.
