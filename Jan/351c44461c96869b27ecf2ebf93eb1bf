Fresh insight emerged at the weekend as to why the management of the Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF) recently recruited new staff members into different cadres of its operations to address manpower gaps. Informed sources confided in The Nation that the development was not unconnected with the decision to motivate staff. Confirming this development, the NSITF had in a statement by its General Manager, Corporate Affairs, Mrs Ijeoma Oji-Okoronkwo, in Abuja, said the management was persuaded to employ new staff in order to boost staff morale. It would be recalled that the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige, had, in August 2021, said the Federal Government placed an embargo on employment because the economy was not in good shape.
