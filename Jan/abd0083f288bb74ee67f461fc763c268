Elumelu held a massive Christmas party at his palatial mansion in Lagos. He invited some of the finest Nigerian musicians, including Wizkid, Davido and Burna Boy, to thrill his guests. Guests also had a rare opportunity of enjoying intimate moments with the star musicians. Responsible for leading the development and execution of UBA Group’s long-term strategy, Uzoka holds a B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Benin and an MBA from the University of Lagos.
