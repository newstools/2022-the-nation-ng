Managing Director, Harvestfield Industries Limited, Prince Martins Awofisayo has lauded the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)’s intervention on processing of agricultural produce. Reacting to a recent pronouncement by another leading agro processor via one of the nation’s news media( not The Nation) that the interventions were unrealistic and only existed on paper, Awofisayo debunked the claim, citing the Commercial Agriculture Credit Scheme and the Anchor Borrowers’ Programme as two main interventions by the CBN from which Nigerian agro processors had immensely benefited. He said: “It is very unfortunate that such a claim is forwarded by a leading cassava processor who belongs to a group that has been most favoured by the CBN and government. I am aware of a lot of agro processors that have benefited from funding by the CBN and it is rightly the CBN that has revolutionised cassava production in Nigeria through its intervention funds”.
