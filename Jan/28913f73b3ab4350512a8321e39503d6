Super Eagles defender Kenneth Omeruo said the current Super Eagles team have what  it takes to lift the 33rd  Africa Cup of Nations, A winner with late coach Stephen Keshi-led side in  2013, Omeruo has been one of the mainstays  of the Super Eagles at Cameroon 2021 and  had a commanding presence in Saturday’s 3-1 Group D win against Sudan in Garoua.  “We have the ability to go all the way like  we did in 2013,” he noted  during the mixed zone session. “We have to take it game by game; we need to finish top of the group and see what happens next.” Eagles conceded a penalty after the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) review for a foul in the box by Ola Aina and Walieldin Khidir pulled a goal back for Sudan from the spot-kick.  “We wanted to keep a clean sheet but it was from VAR decision. It wasn’t as if they scored from direct play.”   Nwakali seeks bigger  Eagles’ role     Super Simon underlines Eagles quest for AFCON     Algeria 0-1 Equatorial Guinea: Obono ends  Fennecs unbeaten…   - Advertisement - Read Also: Super Simon underlines Eagles quest for AFCON The former Chelsea defender praised his central partner William Troost-Ekong: “I am proud of our partnership and the whole team.
