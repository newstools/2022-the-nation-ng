The participation of Nigeria’s Royal Hoopers Club in this year’s Basketball Africa League (BAL) has been rejected by the continental ruling body, FIBA Africa. In a letter signed by FIBA African Regional Director Bile Alphonse, the continental body hinged their rejection of the team to the inability of the Nigeria Basketball Federation (NBBF) to organize a national league following the expiration of the Musa Kida-led NBBF board. “I would like to inform you that the Executive Committee of FIBA Africa, in agreement with FIBA decided at its last session that the Nigerian Rivers Hoops Club is not retained to participate in the final phase of the BAL.”   Pele warns Super Eagles on Gambia     AFCON: prelims wrap up on GOtv, DStv     ITTF: Aruna makes impressive top 14 list   “As the Nigeria Basketball Federation has not confirmed that it has, by its own initiative, ensured the effective organization of a regular national championship this season, FIBA Africa cannot, therefore, authorize the participation of a Nigerian Club in the BAL this year,” he added. BAL is Africa’s premier men’s basketball league and it consists of 12 teams, each qualified through their domestic competition, similar to the format of the UEFA Champions League. - Advertisement - The league is a joint effort between the National Basketball Association (NBA) and International Basketball Federation (FIBA) with sponsorship from Nike, Air Jordan, and Pepsi. Its inaugural season started with the qualifying rounds in October 2019 and the regular season in May 2021. The competition replaces FIBA’s Africa Basketball League as the continent’s top-tier league.
