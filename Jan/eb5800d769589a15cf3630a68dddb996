But when you retire, you don’t become ex-players as such,” President Infantino said. “You go from being players to legends, which is something unique to football, as you are role models for children around the world and you have a special role to play in society. As FIFA President, I would like to thank you for everything you have done and continue to do in football and for football.” “Today you are embarking on a one-year journey of learning and sharing experiences and knowledge,” he added. “It will help shape and build your next 90 minutes and to have the same impact that you once had on the field of play. This programme is important for us and for your personal development, but it is also important for football as a whole.”
