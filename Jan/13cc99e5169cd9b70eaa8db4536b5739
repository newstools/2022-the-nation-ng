Will Nollywood ever really be recognised globally like Bollywood? Reality TV star Leo Dasilva said the industry must be opened up to allow creativity to thrive. He believes there are factors hampering the globalisation of the Nigerian movie industry.

So, the same measure should be adopted by the Nigerian movie industry, he said. He wrote: “You know why Nigeria music is now world music? No more gate keeping. “People without connections can promote their songs from social media. “Until huge talents get their shot, Nollywood will not be global. “Every huge talent from directors to script writers to actors need a shot.”
