Some retired soldiers, under the Coalition of Concerned Veterans and Retired Members of Nigerian Armed Forces (REMENNAF), yesterday laid siege to the gate of the Federal Ministry of Finance while protesting nonpayment of their 24-month pension arrears. The angry veterans blocked the gate to the ministry, singing protest songs, denying workers and visitors access to the ministry. They carried mats and other items in preparation to pass the night at the gate, if their demands were not met. Addressing reporters, the protesters’ National Coordinator and Veterans Commander Aboidun Durojaiye-Herbert described the nonpayment of their pension arrears as unfortunate.

Other retirees had been paid their pension arrears, leaving retired members of Nigerian Armed Forces unattended to. After this place, we will proceed to the Ministry of Defence. We will not back down until we are paid our 24-month arrears.” Finance Minister Zainab Ahmed said provision had been made in the 2022 budget to offset the veterans’ 24-month pension arrears. She directed them to the Service Wide Vote segment of the budget to see where the provision had been made.
