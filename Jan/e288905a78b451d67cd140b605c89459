Kenyan Life coach Benjamin Zulu has said a lady cannot claim to be a Christian and still be a side chick. Zulu, who is known for his vocal stance on issues, explained they were shocked recently by a lady who prayed to God for another ‘sponsor’ (a married man) after she fell out with the former. The life coach shared this via his Instagram page. He wrote: “Apparently, we need to remind this generation that you cannot be a Christian and a side chick at the same time. Fornication and faith don’t go together,” he wrote.

Who bewitched this generation? “They’re going to church on Sundays while leaving men in their houses who they’re not married to. They’re giving money in the church which they sold their bodies to get by sleeping with people’s husbands. “They’re ‘pushing’ with men and when they get babies and are abandoned they start questioning why God ‘allowed them to go through all that.’ As if they consulted God about any of it.” “These people honour me with their mouths but their hearts are far from me.”
