Amidst Nigerians’ fear of playing against the Pharaohs of Egypt complete with Liverpool striker, Mohammed Salah and other of their star players, Super Eagles skipper Ahmed Musa is cocksure that  the often dreaded  Pharaohs of Egypt complete with Liverpool striker Mohammed Salah would be wary of Nigeria  going into Tuesday’s opener  at the 2021  AFCON. The former Kano Pillars  forward said  Nigerians have nothing to worry  about ahead of the duo group’s  D AFCON opener on January 11th “I know the whole talk about our game with Egypt is centred on Mo Salah; nothing has been said about their other players,” Musa said.  “We also have quality players of ours that are envious of other teams including Egypt. Egypt will be worried about us too.” Read Also: Rohr warns of Egypt’s threats on Qatar 2022 Play-off   Fresh rebels threat at Eagles’ venue in Garoua     Senegal, Egypt are threats to Eagles , Olayinka admits     Amuneke, Okoye differ on  ‘fantastic’ Salah   - Advertisement - Meanwhile,  Musa has reassured that the overall interest of the team will come first, saying he would be happier to sit on the bench if it will help Nigeria’s aspiration in Cameroon. Musa recalled with nostalgia how he was benched for most of the 2018 World Cup in Russia and how he was never a negative influence even while on the bench. “Everybody knows that most of the games in Russia at the 2018 World Cup I didn’t get to play. It doesn’t matter whether I play or not, I will always give my full support to the team,” Musa said. “Anybody that saw me on the bench in Russia won’t know whether I am on the pitch or not because I will always support the team. “I appreciate getting my first few games under coach Eguavoen. I am working with him again. I know that we are going to AFCON without much confidence in us but we are going to prove Nigerians wrong there.”
