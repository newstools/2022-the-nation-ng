She said it only reveals the person’s choice and connection with their new date. Blessing advised the fan to rather spend time and talk to her new date on their first meeting rather than opting for sex, seeing communication is more expensive as it has the ability to unravel a person’s true identity. “The fact that you even have the intentions of sleeping with him is your answer. Sleeping with someone on the first date does not make you cheap, it’s just your choice and connection. “But I will advise you talk more on the first date than s3x. S3x is too cheap, communication is more expensive because it will expose their real identity and personal. S3x hides it,” she stated.
