The Nigeria Golf Federation (NGF) has hailed 95-year-old grandfather regarded as the oldest Nigerian playing the game of golf. The NGF, led by Otunba Olusegun Runsewe, presented the London-based Pa James Olujobi Omolaso after he had a few holes at IBB International Golf and Country, Club, Abuja. Pa Omolaso was visiting Abuja from his base when he was discovered. The 28-handicapper regularly plays at Greenwich Estuary Golf course near 02 Arena, London. He has been playing the ancient game for the past 35 years.

I also watch Formula One as well as flip to nearly all sports channels. Generally, I am interested in sports, because I was a sportsperson in my college in those days at Molusi College Ijebu Igbo. I was one of the foundation members of the school,” Pa Omolaso said. - Advertisement - In addition, he called for regular exercise and care for other people. He also tasked Nigerian professional golfers to work hard and exhibit confidence, as they will be recognised if they imbibe the right attitude. Runsewe, who discovered the nonagenarian, urged Nigerians to key into the game of golf as it can be played at any age. “Pa Omolaso is 95 and still comes on the course to play some few holes and make some putts. The fact that Baba has mental alertness and understands what golf is tells us that golf is an ageless game. Today he has demonstrated something: that when you hit a good golf shot, your entire body chemistry communicates,” he said.
