Joe Aribo has admitted that the Super Eagles were not good enough and took too long to get into the game in their shocking defeat to Tunisia last night. The Eagles of Carthage defeated 10-man Super Eagles of Nigeria 1-0 in their round of 16 clash played at the Roumdé Adjia Stadium in Garoua. “We started really slow, we allowed them to get a foothold in the game, not taking anything from the Tunisians but we should have been better in 90 minutes.” Aribo said in an interview immediately after the match. “We took too long to respond until they scored. That was when we started playing and of course the red card to Alex (Iwobi).”   Joshua hell bent to reclaim belt from Usyk     Sportsville Award holds Feb 13     Dare praised on tennis tourney for late Soun   We asked if the team underestimated their North African rivals, the Glasgow Rangers playmaker said that the Super Eagles were not complacent ahead of the game but the North African were the much better side on the night. - Advertisement - “It had nothing to do with underestimating them,” Aribo said. “We go into every game with respect to our opponents. They were the better team, they did what they had to do and we were not good enough at the end of the day.” Yet interim coach Austin Eguavoen has lauded the players for their performance despite the team being edged out by Tunisia last night while blaming it on ill-luck at ongoing AFCON 2021. “I think the boys really gave their best in this competition, we were just unlucky to lose to the Tunisians. I think the red card awarded to Alex Iwobi was not deserved and this really affected our game plan. Our tactics were not predictable and I must commend the players for their good performance,” Eguavoen said.
