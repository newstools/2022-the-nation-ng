National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Iyorchia Ayu, has vowed to pursue completion of the party’s national secretariat in Abuja. But many are worried he may be getting himself involved in something he should stay away from in his own interest. “That’s an unnecessary headache he is about to inherit,” a chieftain of the party told Sentry. Made up of 11 floors, the edifice located at the Central Business District, has dragged on for years and eventually stalled when the party lost power in 2015.

I think it is possible to look for ways in the commercial sector to complete this building,” Ayu said. - Advertisement - Sentry gathered that many close associates of the former Senate President have advised him to concentrate on repositioning the party ahead of the 2023 general elections instead of wasting precious time, energy and resources on what many now refer to as a “white elephant project.’ “I fear for him. He doesn’t need the trouble that the project has become. Every national chairman that had anything to do with that building got their fingers burnt. There is a lot on Ayu’s plate at a time like this for him to be bothering about completing the national secretariat. He should leave that to another administration,” a leader of the party warned. But Ayu has described the secretariat as “a building that must be completed;” stressing that “it must never be allowed to remain wasted as is it. How will he fare where others have failed? Sentry is watching.
