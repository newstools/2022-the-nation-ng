President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed sadness over the passing of a one-time Presidential Candidate in a two-horse race, Bashir Tofa, ”a politician of note, who was also a promoter of Islamic culture and civilization’.’ The president made his feelings known in a tribute to the deceased which was released by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, on Monday in Abuja. President Buhari described the late Tofa as a true nationalist that would be difficult to replace. The president said: ”The late Tofa was noted for his untiring commitment to public enlightenment and was unafraid to speak the truth all the time that he lived. ”He set up the Bureau for Islamic Propagation, BIP, in the mid-80s that helped to unite Muslim Scholars in the Northern States, narrowing the differences that characterized their relationships. The BIP also published books and newspapers.
