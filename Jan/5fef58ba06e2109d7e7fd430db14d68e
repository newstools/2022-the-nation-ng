This includes recurrent, non-debt, expenditure of N6.91 trillion or 40 per cent of total expenditure and capital expenditure of N5.96 trillion or 35 per cent of total expenditure. Debt servicing is estimated at N3.61 trillion, about 21 per cent of total expenditure or 34 percent of total revenue projection. However, the government projected total revenue of N10.74 trillion in 2022, leaving a deficit of N6.39 trillion. Government is expected to issue additional Eurobonds and domestic bonds, including its raving Sukuk bond Latest report by the DMO showed that Nigeria’s public debt stock stood at N38.01 trillion in third quarter 2021. External debt stood at N15.57 trillion or 41 per cent of total public debt while domestic debt stood at N22.43 trillion or 59 per cent of total public debt. Both the government and private sector experts agreed that Nigeria will remain significantly dependent on borrowings to finance its budget in the meantime “We do not see any respite to debt accumulation over the medium term, given our expectation that increased borrowings will be required to plug the rising fiscal deficit. Our prognosis is hinged on continued revenue underperformance relative to the budget and persistent increase in expenditure,” Cordros Capital stated. DMO Director-General, Patience Oniha had said that as a result of poor performance in revenue, there would be increasing borrowing. According to her, much as the  government has been conservative in projecting revenues, it will still be underperforming in revenue. “So, it means that we are relying increasingly on borrowings to finance the activities of government;” Oniha said. She outlined that looking at where the public debt stock is and what it is projected to be, based on the new borrowings provided for in the MTEF; debt stock will grow naturally, same for debt-to-GDP ratio too. Oniha spoke during the 2022-2024 Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and Fiscal Strategy Paper (FSP) interactive session with the House of Representatives’ Committee on Finance.
