Actor Jim Iyke has explained why he doesn’t follow any accounts on his Instagram social media platform. The Nollywood ‘Bad Boy,’ as he is fondly referred to, made this known in a recent interview with media personality, Temisan Emmanuel, of Tea with Tay podcast. Iyke said Instagram was a ‘pseudo’ reality and people should take it as their everyday life. He said, “From day one I got on social media, I didn’t want to follow anybody. I wanted to establish the fact that this is a marketplace. It’s a pseudo-reality there. It’s not what people want to take as their everyday life.” - Advertisement -   Late Sonny Okosun’s father dies     How ladies can have lasting relationships, by Naira Marley     Unlimited LA: My encounter with police during Sean Tizzle’s…   Continuing, he said: “If you see any of my posts, it’s tailored. I don’t post about my family. I don’t post my pleasures. There are certain things I think should be left for one to experience alone. There are three tiers of life that I live. I live the private life, the public life, and the secret life. “Social media is public life. If I want to make a statement in style, if I want to make a statement on my ideology and principles, if I want to market something, or if I want to set a new understanding on my opinion of something, that is where I should be. “If I’m having a good time with people that don’t mind being on that platform, I go there.” Iyke also noted that he was protecting his kids from social media so that they won’t be judged by their actions or be noticed in public. “I have kids that run the mall at every part of the world and no one will say, ‘I know that face’,” he said. However, checks by The Nation showed that Iyke has 2.4million followers on Instagram but was following no account.
