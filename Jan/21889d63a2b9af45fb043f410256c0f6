Like the little acorn, the intensive little play has grown to become a massive star-studded theatrical phenomenon’ Philomena is the deftly told story of three characters who find themselves, by pure chance, in the same space at the same time, each with his and her personal issues. The story of the fairly ordered lives of Philomena, a prostitute in her last laps, Area her regular customer, frustrated master’ degree holder, and primary school teacher is disrupted by the arrival of Wesley, a bombastic journalist with an inflated view of himself when he gets his sack on the phone while sitting in Philomena’s beer parlour for a consolatory drink. On her own part, Monalisa Chinda, who is joint Executive Producer with Bimbo Manuel said, ‘From my first encounter with the play, Philomena, it became a story that demanded to be told.’
