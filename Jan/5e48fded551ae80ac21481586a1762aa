Former Manchester United striker Odion Ighalo has left Saudi Arabian side Al Shabab for city rivals Al Hilal on an 18-month deal as the Nigerian seeks continental success with the reigning Asian champions. The 32-year-old, who is currently the leading goalscorer in the Saudi Pro League season with 12 goals, had only joined Al Shabab last February. Top scorer at the last African Cup of Nations in 2019, Ighalo returned from international retirement last year and was named in the Nigeria squad for this year’s ongoing tournament in Cameroon, but Al Shabab refused to release him. “I had a great time with Al Shabab and I thank the club management and fans for the love and support,” Ighalo, who is a replacement for departed French striker Bafetimbi Gomis, told BBC Sport Africa.
