THOMAS Tuchel has criticised Romelu Lukaku for giving an explosive interview in which the striker said he was “not happy” with his situation at Chelsea. Lukaku, who became Chelsea’s record signing after leaving Internazionale for £97.5m last summer, added to Tuchel’s problems when comments about his dissatisfaction with his role were released by Sky Italia on Thursday. The striker, who has scored seven times in 18 matches this season, said that he had held talks with his manager and that he wants to return to Inter one day.

Chelsea have fallen eight points below Manchester City after a poor run and Tuchel said that Lukaku, who has had problems with injury and Covid-19, had hurt his side’s focus with his comments.
