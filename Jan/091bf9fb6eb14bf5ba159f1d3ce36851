Singer Davido has launched a scathing criticism at his cousin Bamidele Adeleke who declared his interest to run in the 2022 Osun State gubernatorial election on Twitter. Davido, who posted a picture of his cousin posing with a provisional clearance certificate for the Osun State gubernatorial election, alleged Bamidele struggled to graduate with a Second Class (Lower Division) and has not succeeded in building “one single thing in his life on his own.” He also accused the aspirant of ‘forming intellectual,’ warning the people of Osun to beware of ‘FAKES’. He wrote: “Wonderful! Me I finished uni with a 2:1. But it’s now cousin Dele who struggled to even get a 2:2 that is now forming “intellectual”.
