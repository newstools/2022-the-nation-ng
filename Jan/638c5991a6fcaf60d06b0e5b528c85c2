He served as Oyo Deputy Governor from May 2003 to January 2006. Following the impeachment of the Governor (Rashidi Ladoja), Alao-Akala was sworn into office in January 2006 and served for 11 months. In December 2006, the impeachment was overturned by the Supreme Court and Rashidi Ladoja was reinstated. Alao-Akala later contested and won the governorship election in 2007 under the platform of the PDP and became Governor from May 29- May 2011.

Lamidi Adesina died at 71 Ajimobi Isiaka died aged 71 Alao Akala died aged 71.  “Each one of them were governors of Oyo State at one time or the other. Am l a pessimist?
