A brewing controversy appears to have emerged in the Adeleke family over the Osun governorship election scheduled for July 16, 2022, The Nation has learnt. The Nation gathered two members of the family – Dele Adeleke and Ademola Adeleke – are jostling for the governorship ticket of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). The party has cleared all the aspirants, including Sen. Ademola Adeleke; former Secretary to Osun State Government, Alhaji Abdulateef Akinbade; Dr Akin Ogunbiyi, Mr Omirin Emmanuel Olusanya, Dele Adeleke and Mr Dotun Babayemi. But one of the family members, who is clearly not in support of Dele’s ambition is David Adeleke aka Davido, the popular pop star. In a post on Twitter on Tuesday, Davido told the people of Osun to beware of fakes like Dele Adeleke. - Advertisement - Read Also: Ogunbiyi denies alliance with Adeleke in Osun poll   Senate to Buhari: declare war against terrorists     Buhari never directed anyone to remove petrol subsidy…     High Chiefs agree to withdraw suit for new Olubadan’s…   He said: “Wonderful!

He said he believes he is more fitted to bringing better economic fortunes to the State than any other candidate in the PDP and APC. Dele had once said that being Senator Adeleke’s nephew should not hamper his aspiration to serve the people of the State.
