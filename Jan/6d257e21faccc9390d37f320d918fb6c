Tesla is recalling nearly 500,000 cars in the United States due to technical troubles that could heighten the risk of a crash. The electric-vehicle maker plans to recall 356,309 Model 3 vehicles made between 2017 and 2020 because the rear-view camera cable harnesses could be damaged from opening and shutting the trunk, Tesla told the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The glitch could keep the rearview camera image from displaying, the company said. Tesla is also recalling up to 119,009 Model S cars made since 2014 due to a defective front-trunk latch that could have the hood popping up unexpectedly and obstruct the driver’s view, according to another statement to the NHTSA.

The NHTSA last week announced Tesla owners would no longer be able to play video games on a Tesla console while their vehicles are moving. The federal auto-safety regulator said Tesla would send a software update so the function called “Passenger Play” would lock and not work when the vehicles are in motion. - Advertisement - The announcement came a day after the agency said it would open an investigation into concerns about Tesla’s video games distracting drivers. Separately, the government last August announced it has opened a formal investigation into Tesla’s Autopilot system after a series of collisions with parked emergency vehicles.
