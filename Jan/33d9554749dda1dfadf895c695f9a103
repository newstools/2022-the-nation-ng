He also met with Borno State Governor Babagana Zulum, where the extremist group Boko Haram launched its Islamist insurgency in 2009 that has spread to neighbouring countries such as Cameroon, Niger, and Chad. In the Northeast, he met with Nigerians who have been affected by the violence, as well as humanitarian partners in Maiduguri, Bama, and Damasak. The conflict in the Lake Chad Basin has taken a heavy toll on communities across border areas of the affected countries, putting more than 10 million people at risk and in need of humanitarian assistance. During his visit to Damasak on the border with Niger, Griffiths heard from women and families displaced by the violence. They told him of their hopes to return home, yet they despaired that they were unable to plan for a better future given continuing insecurity and attacks by armed groups.
