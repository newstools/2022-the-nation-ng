Nigerians have intensified campaign asking foreign institutions to stop demanding an English proficiency test — the International English Language Testing System (IELTS). IELTS is one of the world’s known English language tests for work, study and migration. It is an international standardised test of English language proficiency. Annually, thousands of young Nigerian migrants take IELTS tests physically in different locations all over Nigeria, as part of the requirements to secure admissions into universities overseas or work abroad. The Nation learnt the test costs over N80,000 and N90,000 per time and expires after two years. One has to re-sit if they have not been successful with their applications for UK scholarships.

In 2020, the UK Home office, which is said to be primarily in charge of the test, had said that it did not have evidence that the majority of Nigerians speak English as a first language. Many Nigerians took to social media with the hashtags — #ReformIELTSPolicy, #IELTS and #TOEFL calling on the UK home office to remove Nigeria from the list of countries whose citizens are required to take English Proficiency tests. Some other requests include cancellation of two-year expiry clause, including Nigeria in the UKVI exemption list, and reducing test cost and increasing validity period. Meanwhile, the UK home office is yet to react as at the time of report.
