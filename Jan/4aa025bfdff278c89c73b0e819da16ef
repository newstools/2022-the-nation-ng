We know we can make it up by ball possession,” he said after the match. He added: “We had three things in mind and the first thing is to win the game and how do we win the game? By winning the ball and trying to cut Salah off the ball. We are going to approach every game as if it is a final. We are going to take the game after game and see where we are going to get to in the competition. “Every team that has come to AFCON should be respected regardless of the name of the country as there are no minnows again. So if you don’t plan well and put in the effort, you are going to be shocked. I don’t know who is going to win the competition but we will try in our own way to approach every game with all seriousness,” Eguavoen enthused.
