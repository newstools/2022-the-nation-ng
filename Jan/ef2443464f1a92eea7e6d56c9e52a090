Anambra Governor-elect Professor Chukwuma Soludo, has told Nigerians not to address him as “His Excellency”. He said he prefers to be referred to as Mr Governor or Charlie Nwangbafor. The former Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) spoke during the inauguration of the Transition Committee members. Soludo appointed an 80- member Transition Committee headed by former Minister of Education, Dr Oby Ezekwesili, with other prominent citizens of Nigeria as members. Speaking at the inauguration of the committee, Soludo said: “I was called His Excellency a while ago but may I plead that that Excellency tag should please wait for now.   Diri rules out payment of ransom for kidnapped…     How youths razed my house, other buildings, by Ebonyi…     JAMB rejects NABTEB A level as entry requirement for DE   - Advertisement - “That is part of what we will discuss in this committee. You may just need to learn how to call me by my name, but if that isn’t good for you, then, may I request that you simply call me ‘Charlie Nwangbafor’. “If that one is so difficult for you that you must be formal in addressing me, then you can address me as Mr Governor.” He mentioned that some of such little mistakes were things that would be addressed during the meeting of the transition committee. According to him: “My manifesto is not just for the campaign but a contract I have signed with Ndi Anambra and since they have chosen me amongst all the other qualified candidates that contested at the last election, I’m committed to undertaking the transformation of Anambra and ensure impactful leadership and there is no stopping my work plan for a better Anambra. “Anambra must be transformed to that mega industrialised economy, our roads both in the rural areas and cities, markets, environment challenges must be addressed.”
