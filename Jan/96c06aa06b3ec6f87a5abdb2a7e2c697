Quadri Aruna was the hero as TTC RhönSprudel Fulda-Maberzell returned to the play-off zone in the Table Tennis Bundesliga (TTBL) following a resounding 3-0 win over visiting TTC Neu-Ulm . Considered as a battle for a playoff spot, TTC Neu-Ulm overtook TTC to occupy fourth place and secured a place in the play-off after TTC’s away tie against TTC OE Bad Homburg was cancelled over the Covid-19 outbreak. But a comfortable 3-0 win at home by TTC returned them to the play-off after an emphatic win by Aruna, Ruwen Filus, and Alexandre Cassin. The door opener for TTC’s eighth league win of the season was the opening single between Apolonia and Aruna.
