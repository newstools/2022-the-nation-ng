The Ijaw Youth Council (IYC) has warned against reopening Dowen College Lekki without all issues being addressed. The group staged a protest in front of the school on Thursday in the wake of the advice by the Directorate of Public Prosecution (DPP). The DPP absolved some students and staff of blame in the death of a JSS2 pupil of the school, Sylvester Oromoni Jnr. Oromoni died last November 31, days shy of his 12th birthday after falling ill due to injuries his family said were allegedly caused by beating from senior students forcing him to join a cult. The DPP report released the five students Oromoni named as well as some members of staff in charge of the boarding house. - Advertisement - In a video shared online, a spokesman for the group faulted the DPP for clearing the accused before concluding the investigation.

The spokesman said: “We are here today to express our anger and grievances with the fake and corrupt report released by the Lagos State Director of Public Prosecution that this school where cultists are being trained is cleared. “They cleared the same people that killed our son without trial, without concluded investigation; they said they cleared this school to reopen. “If they open the school, the whole Ijaw youths will come here on Monday with our school bags, feeding bottles and join we that are already on ground. “So now, we want to send a message to the governor of this state; I believe he is a well-trained person, if he supports injustice, then this school will not have peace.” On Tuesday, the Executive Director, Admissions of the school told The Nation that the DPP report was a “welcome development for us” but declined to make further comments because of the sensitivity of the case.
