The family of a deceased civil servant in Yobe State, Alhaji Baba Aji Mamman, has fulfilled his last wish by returning to the state government the sum of N11 million reckoned as his unearned salaries. Mamman, who died on March 28, 2020, was before his death an official of Yobe Rural Electrification Board in Damaturu, the state capital. He was said to have infrequently gone to work as an employee of the state government as a result of illness or deliberate absenteeism. Pricked by his conscience that he collected sums he did not deserve as salaries while he worked with the state government, Mamman, according to an advert the family placed in Daily Trust, told his family to ensure that the money was refunded.
