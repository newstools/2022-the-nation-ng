Over 17.5 million Nigerians have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccines, according to the National daily call-in data from the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA). The Agency revealed that as of January 14, 2022, 12,559,347 of the total eligible persons targeted for COVID-19 vaccination were reached with the first dose, while 4,967,233 were reached with the second dose (fully vaccinated). In total, 17,526,580 persons have been vaccinated with at least one dose of the lifesaving COVID-19 vaccine. 260,431 eligible persons across the country have received their Pfizer COVID-19 booster doses, while 12,963 eligible persons have received their Moderna booster doses. However, two (2) states are yet to begin the administration of the booster doses. They are Kogi and Niger States. In total, 273,394 eligible persons have received their COVID-19 booster doses. Recall that on December 10, 2021, the Federal Government started the administration of COVID-19 booster doses in order to give Nigerians extra-protection against COVID-19, especially against the Omicron variant. However, only eligible Nigerians can get the booster doses. They include persons who are 18 years and above, and those who must have received their second dose of AstraZeneca, Pfizer Bio-N-Tech or Moderna at least 6 months after their second dose. For Johnson and Johnson booster doses, a time interval of 2 months or more is required.
