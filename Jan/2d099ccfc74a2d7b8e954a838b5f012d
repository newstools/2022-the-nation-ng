Super Eagles forward Odion Ighalo says Nigerians put the Super Eagles in their prayers as he would not be in Cameroon with them for the 2021 African Cup of Nations (AFCON) which started on Sunday. The Super Eagles begin their quest for a fourth AFCON crown when they trade tackles with the Pharaohs of Egypt today at the Roumdé Adjia Stadium, Garoua. The Al Shabab striker could not make the trip due to his club blocking his move to feature at the tournament having signed him when he had already retired from international football with Nigeria. The 32-year-old was included in Austin Eguavoen’s 28-man squad, but the Saudi Arabian club confirmed last week that he would not be joining the squad as the invitation from the NFF arrived late.
