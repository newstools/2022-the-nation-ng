Super Eagles head coach, Austin Eguavoen has charged his players to move on from their 1-0 victory over the Pharaohs as they prepare for their 2021 Africa Cup of Nations Group D second game with Falcons of Sudan tomorrow. Eguavoen, AFCON winner in 1994,  reportedly said  that their preparation for the tie with the Sudanese started the following morning after the win. “I am happy with our output against Egypt and especially the way the boys set up and approached the game the way we agreed was best. Everything worked,” Eguavoen told NFF TV. “But we have shifted our focus completely to the next match and it is another day and another team and a different approach. “I am happy with the playing personnel that we have got and the way they are ready to give their all.

Sudan is in focus now and we have to deal with that, squarely. “The camp is so interesting and is once more like a family setting. Everyone is like another’s brother. The spirit is high and I believe our team will go far in this competition,” another official said. Three points tomorrow  will guarantee group leaders Nigeria a place in the Round of 16 of the 33rd  AFCON, meaning a more relaxed approach to their final group phase clash with debutants Guinea Bissau also in Garoua on Wednesday next week. If they finish top of Group D, the three-time champions will remain in Garoua for their Round of 16 task.
