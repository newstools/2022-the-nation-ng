Manchester United lost for the first time in the Premier League under interim coach Ralf Rangnick as Joao Moutinho struck late on to give Wolverhampton Wanderers victory at Old Trafford. Moutinho drove home on the half-volley after Adama Traore’s cross had only been half cleared by Phil Jones, who was making his first appearance for the hosts in 707 days. It was a deserved win for Wolves, who dominated the first half and also hit the bar late on through Romain Saiss’ free-kick.
