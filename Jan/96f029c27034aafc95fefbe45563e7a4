Currently, residents of Lafia are having a 24-hour electricity supply,” he said. Lawal said the administration of  Sule would continue to execute people oriented projects and programmes that would have direct bearing on citizens’ lives. He noted that citizens were happy with the level of infrastructural development; ranging from roads construction, modern bus terminals in Karu and Lafia, and due attention to other sectors such as health, education, agriculture and youths and women empowerment.
