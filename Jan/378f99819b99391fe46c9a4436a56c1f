Ondo State Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has dared the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to report him to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), over the alleged N500million spent on a concert tagged: ‘Countdown Show to Herald 2022’. Spokesman for the Ondo PDP, Kennedy Peretei, had in a statement alleged that N500millon was spent on the concert anchored by the governor’s son in-law, Michael Olatunde. Akeredolu, in a statement by Information and Orientation Commissioner Donald Ojogo, challenged the PDP to show proof that he registered 13 companies in 2017.

The statement said: “Their assertions in respect of 13 companies they claimed were registered by the governor’s family in 2017 without evidence expose the juvenile and pedestrian composure of the PDP. It is sheer waste of precious media space to assert without evidence to prove. - Advertisement - “On the alleged expenditure of N500,000,000 (Five Hundred Million Naira) by the Ministry of Information on the ‘Countdown Show to Herald 2022’, it’s not just laughable, but presents the PDP as most unserious. The inconsistency in their lies is legendary, as their first release had indicated N200,000,000 in respect of same subject. The public deserves to know more. Therefore, the PDP must hurry to report this to the EFCC for investigation. “While it is clear that the insidious naked dance of the PDP manifests the height of idleness and political depression, the party’s persistence in the display of uncanny posture on the path of unbelievable lies calls to question whether or not the PDP respects the Ondo State public at all. No serious public takes such beer parlour talks seriously.”
