Riyad Mahrez and his teammates failed to spark as reigning Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) champions Algeria drew goalless with Sierra Leone in their opening Group E fixture on Tuesday. Heading into the delayed 2021 tournament aiming to become the first team to win consecutive AFCON titles since Egypt won three in a row between 2006 and 2010, Algeria were favorites.

Algeria were able to call on the likes of Baghdad Bounedjah —- who netted the winner against Senegal in the 2019 final —- and Said Benrahma from the bench. But the West Ham attacker spurned a glorious opportunity late on as the holders’ profligacy proved costly in an underwhelming start to their title defence.
