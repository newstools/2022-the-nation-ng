As Super Eagles look forward to playing Ghana’s Black Stars in a two-legged 2022 World Cup playoff in March, Nigerians have been urged to rally behind the national team. Director-General of the National Council for Arts and Culture, Otunba Olusegun Runsewe at the weekend urged Nigerians to put behind the team’s early exit from the AFCON in Cameroon. “It is time that we put the early exit from the Africa Cup of Nations behind us and stay focused on Nigeria qualifying for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar,” the NCAC DG who doubles as the president of the Nigerian Golf Federation, said. “We cannot continue to talk about Eagles not going far in the tournament after showing so much promise at the group stage.”   Aruna hits top 11 in ITTF ranking     Federer hails Nadal after historic 21st Grand Slam     Ighalo swaps Al Hilal for Al Shabab   Runsewe stressed that a positive attitude and encouragement towards the Super Eagles will help the players and ensure they beat Ghana to the World Cup ticket. - Advertisement - “The players need our support. They equally feel the weight of not going far in the tournament in Cameroon but we cannot be dwelling on the past now when we have a bigger task ahead of us. This is why Nigerians should rally round Eagles with support and prayers,” he noted. He commended the Sports Minister, Chief Sunday Dare, and the Federal Government for the massive support given to the team. The NCA boss who mobilized 10 million virtual supports for the Super Eagles during the AFCON further called on all Nigerians at home and in the Diaspora to sustain the culture of supporting the country, adding the Black Stars are beatable. “The Black Stars we saw during the tournament in Cameroon look beatable if we do our homework well,” Runsewe reiterated.
