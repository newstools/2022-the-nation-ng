MOROCCO head coach Vahid Halilhodzic has said he is confident his side can silence Egypt winger Mohamed Salah in Sunday’s Africa Cup of Nations quarterfinal in Yaounde. The knockout clash will pit the Liverpool star against Watford left-back Adam Masina, who was taken off at half-time when he struggled to contain Salah in Liverpool’s 5-0 win in October. Halilhodzic told ESPN he believes Masina will enjoy better fortunes in the rematch between the two players, even if he may need a little help from his teammates. “Over the last two-to-three months, Salah was the best player in the world,” Halilhodzic said. “He’s been absolutely unstoppable with his club, so yes, we’ve looked at videos of his qualities, and we’ve prepared tactically for this specific meeting against a fantastic player.
