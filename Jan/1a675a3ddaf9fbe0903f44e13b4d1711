Talented singer Oluwatobi Wande Ojosipe aka Wande Coal has described fame as crazy and intoxicating. The vocalist, whose music career took off in 2006 after signing to now-defunct Mo’ Hits Records, stated this in an interview with Pan African Music. According to the ‘Mushin to Mo Hits’ star, ‘you could be normal as an upcoming artiste but when fame comes, it changes everything.’ “Sure. Fame is crazy and a different ball game. You could be normal for a long time and when fame comes into your life, it changes everything and how you relate with people – family, friends,” he said.

Now, I’m wary of letting anything get to me because where I came from is always in my head. I’ve gone through so much to get here, so I’ll keep working and creating music because if I wasn’t doing that, nobody would know me in the first place.” - Advertisement - Coal, who is gearing up for the release of his highly anticipated third studio album, six years after his sophomore, ‘Wanted,’ said being cited as an influence to new generation artists makes him fulfilled as a singer. “Being Wande Coal is a lot of stress yet fulfillment. Being cited as an influence to different levels of new generation talents from Wizkid to the Maleek Berrys, Fireboys is not something that I take for granted.” The Black Diamond Entertainment honcho pledged to keep supporting new generation talents, saying that he is hunting for young talents to train and sign to his record label.
