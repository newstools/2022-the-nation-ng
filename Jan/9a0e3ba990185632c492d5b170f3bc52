Actor Alexx Ekubo has appealed to Nigerians to eschew violence and embrace peace and unity. Ekubo urged people to shun any form of riot and give the current administration a chance to build Nigeria. “We are all trying to live and trying to make heaven but please stop the killing. We cannot survive another war, we cannot survive another riot or outbreak, so let give the government of the day a chance to build Nigeria,” he said. Continuing the ‘Ladies Men’ actor said: “Nigeria is for all of us. If we keep destroying our country we don’t have anywhere to go. I can visit America, I can visit any part of the world but at the end of the day – I’m a Nigerian.

Some please find other outlets to let out your anger and frustration, is not by violence is not about the kidnapping. Please, stop it, we are all one.” Ekubo stated further that if we can tolerate one another, the country will be great again. “You can’t judge a person by what he doesn’t have control over. You were born into Islam, I was born into Christianity. I was born Igbo, I was born from the East and I don’t have control over that so it will be stupid of me to think that I’m superior to you because you’re Yoruba or Hausa. So, what makes you think you are superior to me because you are from the North or South. Please, let us think about it, people.”
