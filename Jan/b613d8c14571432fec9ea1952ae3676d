AWARD-WINNING actor, Timini Egbuson, has debunked claims of being a bad boy as perceived by his female fans. Timini says though, he cuts the look of a bad boy and seems to have taken after Jim Iyke’s Nollywood bad boy persona – with many roles at his beck and call – he has a good personality but has been grossly misunderstood. In a recent Instagram live, he said, “I swear like I’m not a bad boy. I’m just very misunderstood. People tend to think that I am but for some weird reason, I just know how to interpret bad boy roles because I kind of grew up around a lot of these bad boys so I just copy them. It is not necessarily that I am a bad boy, people that know me personally probably will tell you that I’m one of the nicest guys out there.”   Bimbo Manuel features Monalisa Chinda, Francis Duru in…     Yung Bos secures top Naija music award for best…     Dice releases debut EP, 48 Hours In The Motherland   Responding to a fan who asked if his character in movies reflects who he is as a person, he said, “Not necessarily, regardless of whatever the creators or directors write on paper, I believe that as a fantastic actor, I can translate it.” Read Also:Dice releases debut EP, 48 Hours In The Motherland - Advertisement - Speaking on his journey as an actor, the Elevator Baby actor said “Every time I feel like my journey as an actor I constantly shock myself, I constantly surprise myself with my performances and I can see the growth, like if you play MTV Shuga or an old episode of Skinny girl in transit, I mean the acting was still good then yeah but now it’s like I am a hundred times better and that is the kind of energy that I am going into 2022 with.” There is no doubt that Bad Boy T, as he is mostly referred to, is starting the year on a good note as he plays the lead role in over three films scheduled for cinema releases before the end of January 2022.
