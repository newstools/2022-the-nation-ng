The Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS in Nigeria (NEPWHAN) has urged the Federal Government to ensure that the rights of People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) are protected by providing adequate legal services for them. The Network noted that while many of its members, especially women and children, are falling victims to Gender-based Violence (GBV) across the country, the perpetrators are going scot-free because of their lack of access to legal services, and lack of capacity by the affected community to document the incidences when they occur. It also called for the urgent adoption of pending laws on GBV, including the Gender and Equal Opportunities Bill and the Disability Rights Bill in accordance with the global Convention.
