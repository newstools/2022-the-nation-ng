Sudan’s coach Burhan Tia said his side should not be underrated by Nigeria’s Super Eagles and others during the TotalEnergies Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), Cameroon 2021. Tia who took over the team from French Hubert Velud, who was sacked early last month, told Cafonline.com that although his team is young, they are very hungry and have a huge desire to perform. Sudan is drawn in Group D alongside Guinea Bissau, Nigeria and Egypt. Tia, whose team has been camped in Yaounde, played two friendly matches against Ethiopia (lost 3-2) and Zimbabwe (drew 0-0) made it clear that with the good preparations they have had, the team has what it takes to perform well. “Our team is young, and we are building for the future. The spirit, ambition and motivation will be our strong weapons in the tournament,” added the experienced coach. - Advertisement - Read Also: Minister: Cameroon ready to host well   Choupo-Moting: Eto’o, Okocha fuelled my  dreams     Minister: Cameroon ready to host well     Eagles’ jersey numbers unveiled   Tia made it clear that although they are placed in a strong group, they are prepared to fight and take their chances to make it to the next round first. “There is nothing impossible in football. The group might be strong, but with good preparations and concentration we will be able to make it to the knockout stage,” added Tia. He said after missing out on the last four editions of AFCON, this is the time that Sudan should send a strong message by playing good football and getting the results. “We need to prove a point that we have developed and belong to the top group since we have won the AFCON trophy before,” concluded Tia. Sudan lifted the AFCON trophy in 1970 when they last hosted the continent’s biggest football tournament.
