Athletics Federation of Nigeria president Tonobock Okowa will lead a high profile delegation of the federation to Uromi, Edo state today for the final funeral rite for Brown ‘Juju man’ Ebewele. The delegation will include board members of the AFN and a former president of the federation. Prince Adeniyi Beyioku, the AFN Secretary General of the AFN, said the delegation will be in Uromi to pay its last respect to the former Nigeria decathlon champion who was twice the federation’s technical director. “The AFN has concluded plans to be in Uromi on Friday to honour the late Brown Ebewele who died on 31 December, 2021 in Warri after a brief illness,” Beyioku said in a statement. “Our president Tonobock Okowa will lead the delegation which will also have other board members and staff of the federation.
