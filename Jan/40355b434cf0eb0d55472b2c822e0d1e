Cameroon is fully ready to host the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), the country’s minister of Sports and Physical Education Narcisse Mouelle Kombi said.  “There is no need to worry about all the preparations. Things are moving on very well. We are fully ready to host. All the commissions and the site supervisors are very committed,” Kombi, also president of the competition’s organizing committee, told reporters in the capital Yaounde after a meeting to assess last-minute preparations and address concerns about COVID-19, infrastructure and security in the host country barely three days before the tournament begins. Cameroon has faced scrutiny and criticism in the lead-up to the tournament over the not-ready-Olembe Stadium which is scheduled to host the opening and closing match of the tournament. Kombi said that works at the stadium were virtually done and it was set to host “a very beautiful opening ceremony of the tournament”.
