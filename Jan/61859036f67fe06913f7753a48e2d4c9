Worried by the menace of moral decadence among teenagers globally, and determined to make a positive change, a renowned global evangelist and holiness preacher, Pastor W. F. Kumuyi, will convene a programme, the Global Youth Convention (GYC), with the theme: ‘Impact’. It is designed as a five-day programme, which is scheduled to hold from January 5 to 9 when Dr. Kumuyi will address fundamental issues affecting teenagers, undergraduates and young professionals/adults. Prof. O. S. Oyediran of the University of Lagos, a co-chair of the Organising Committee, believes that at the heart of the global programme is the compelling need “to address the rapidly increasing instances of deviant culture among youths, decline in positive societal role models and the need for transformative innovation.”   Abiru reiterates commitment to quality representation     Fatima Foundation donates borehole to community     Red, Blue rail line projects still on course, says Sanwo-Olu   He said: “The GYC Impact programme is specially designed for young teenagers in high (secondary) schools, campus students & workers, National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) members and young adults/professionals. “It is also packaged to give the participants a fresh start in the new year with a line-up of speakers with proven track records in their fields of endeavour.” - Advertisement - Although the programme will be anchored by Pastor Kumuyi, he will be assisted by special guest speakers, including boardroom guru, Ibukun Awosika, business innovator, Iyinola Aboyeji, and guest gospel music artiste, Dunsin Oyekan.
