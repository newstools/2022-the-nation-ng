Chairman Senate Committee on Customs, Excise and Tariff, Senator Francis Alimikhena last night withdrew from seeking re-election as Senator representing Edo North Senatorial District. This is even as he announced his resignation from the All Progressives Congress (APC). In a similar vein, former Deputy Senate President, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, denied joining the Labour Party as reported by a section of the media. Alimikhena in a letter he personally signed and addressed to the National Chairman of the APC, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, said his decision was due to injustice meted out to him by the party. The terse letter dated May 27, 2022, reads: “I write to notify you that I have withdrawn from the primary election as a result of injustice and also withdraw my membership of the All Progressives Congress (APC).”   TETFund warns tertiary institutions against…     Nigeria’s security problem not ordinary, Adeboye…     Lagos West APC senatorial primary: Party is supreme, says…   Recall that Ailimikhena has been having a running battle with a former National Chairman of APC, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, over the Edo North Senatorial seat. Also, Ekweremadu in a statement by his media aide, Uche Anichukwu, said he had not joined the LP. He had earlier withdrawn from the governorship race in Enugu State. The statement reads: “Our attention has been drawn to online misinformation to the effect that former Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, has joined the Labour Party. “This is false and should be disregarded.”
