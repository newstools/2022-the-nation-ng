Rangers star Calvin Bassey has been one of the revelations of the season. The 22-year-old made 50 appearances in all competitions, playing at left-back, left wing-back as well as centre-back in a back three and a back four. It is at centre-back where he has truly shone, putting in a man-of-the-match display in the Europa League final. On the back of that performance and his season, he has been linked with Wolves and Aston Villa, as well as Chelsea and Bayern Munich.
