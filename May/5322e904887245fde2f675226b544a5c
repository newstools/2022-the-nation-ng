The former Nigeria international  Victor Moses secured his first trophy win in Russia after helping Spartak Moscow beat Dinamo Moscow 2-1 to win the Russian Cup inside the Stadion Luzhniki in Moscow yesterday. With Dinamo Moscow finishing the Premier League season in the top three and Spartak managing a disappointing tenth position, Moses and co were the underdogs going into the final against their city rivals. But goals from Sobolev and Promes either side of halftime sandwiched Zakharyan’s 55th -minute effort for Dinamo and powered Spartak to their first Russian Cup triumph since 2003.

The 2022 Russian Cup is the first trophy Moses will win since he joined Spartak two years ago from Chelsea first on loan and then permanently for €5 million a year later. The former Crystal Palace winger only picked up a Premier League runners-up medal in his first season with the Gladiators. Before arriving in Moscow, however, Moses won the Europa League, the Premier League and the English FA with Chelsea. The 32-year-old was also a member of the Super Eagles squad that lifted the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations in South Africa, Nigeria’s third continental title.
