Sports management expert, Christian Emeruwa, has stated his vision for Nigeria Football as he gears up for the upcoming Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) elections later in the year. Emeruwa, who is currently the head of the Safety and Security Department in CAF and a FIFA Senior Safety and Security Officer, is seeking to replace the incumbent NFF Amaju Pinnick when the latter’s second term tenure ends in September. “This decision of mine is borne out of the belief that our football, your football needs a breath of fresh air,” Emeruwa said in a video shared across social media platforms.

The security expert also voiced the need for a robust and comprehensive coaching education for coaches at all levels and the need to see the local league thrive, adding the need for adequate support for state associations to carry out their primary functions of developing football at the grassroots.
