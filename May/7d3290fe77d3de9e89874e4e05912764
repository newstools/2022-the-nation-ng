The Supreme Court yesterday reserved judgment in the suit filed by President Muhammadu Buhari and Attorney-General of the Federation Abubakar Malami, to void the provisions of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act, 2022. Justice Musa Dattijo, who led the seven-member panel of the Justices, reserved judgment after counsel to all the parties adopted all their processes. He, however, said the court will announce a date to parties involved for judgment. On May 19, the apex court admitted an application filed by Rivers to be joined in the suit. The apex court, had allowed the joinder application that Rivers brought through the Speaker of its House of Assembly and its Attorney-General and adjourned hearing on the suit until May 26. The applicants told the court that they were opposed to the suit marked SC/CV/504/2022, which originally had the National Assembly as the sole Respondent. NAN reports that Buhari and Malami filed a suit at the Supreme Court, seeking an interpretation of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Amendment Act 2022. They are seeking an order of the apex court to strike out the section of the Electoral Act, saying it is inconsistent with the Constitution. Justice Musa Dattijo allowed the joinder application that Rivers brought through the Speaker of its House of Assembly and its Attorney-General and adjourned hearing on the suit until May 26. They are seeking an order of the apex court to strike out the section of the Electoral Act, saying it is inconsistent with the nation’s Constitution. The plaintiffs contend that Section 84 (12) of the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 2022 is inconsistent with the provisions of Sections 42, 65, 66, 106, 107, 131, 137, 147, 151, 177, 182, 192 and 196 of the Constitution of Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, (as amended), as well as Article 2 of the African Charter on Human and People and Peoples Rights.

They urged the court to make a declaration that the joint and combined reading of sections 65, 66, 106, 107, 131, 137, 147, 151, 177, 182, 192 and 196 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, (as amended); the provision of Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022, which also ignores Section 84(3) of the same Act, is an additional qualifying and/or disqualifying factors for the National Assembly, House of Assembly, Gubernatorial and Presidential elections as enshrined in the said constitution, hence unconstitutional, unlawful, null and void.” In the same vein, the National Assembly had asked the Supreme Court to strike out the suit. The National Assembly, in its counter-affidavit, filed by its lawyer, Kayode Ajulo, said the Supreme Court cannot be invoked to amend the provision of any law validity made by lawmakers in the exercise of their legislative powers as granted by the Constitution. They argued that the 1999 Constitution, as amended gave the National Assembly the power to make laws for good governance. NAN reports that on May 11, the Court of Appeal sitting in Abuja, vacated the judgement of the Federal High Court in Umuahia, Abia, which voided the provisions of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act, 2022. The appellate court, in a unanimous decision led by Justice Hamma Akawu Barka, held that the high court, acted without jurisdiction. It held that the Plaintiff, Mr Nduka Edede, lacked the locus standi to institute the action. According to the appellate court, Edede, failed to establish any cause of action that warranted him to approach the court on the issue, noting that the plaintiff was unable to prove how he was directly affected by that section of the newly amended Electoral Act. Consequently, it struck out the suit marked: FHC/UM/CS/26/2022, which Edede filed before the Umuahia court. Nonetheless, the appellate court, while determining the appeal on the merit, held that the said provision of the electoral law was unconstitutional because it is in breach of Section 42 (1)(a) of the 1999 Constitution, as Amended, stressing that the section denied a class of Nigerian citizens their right to participate in election.
