Soldiers have disrupted the protest by students of the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) Ile-Ife, Osun State over ongoing strike by members of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU). The protesters mounted barricades on two lanes of the Ife/Ilesha/ Akure expressway. The barricades mounted close to the Oduduwa University roundabout and Moro end of the expressway caused a girdlock on the busy highway. By 2:45pm, a convoy led by soldiers ran into the protest at the Oduduwa University end of the road but the students insisted the convoy will not pass.
