Okocha, has hailed the National Chairman of the party, Senator Iyorchia Ayu, for speaking the minds of ‘Deltans’ that Governor Ifeanyi Okowa was the pride of the PDP. Okocha, who is equally the leader of PDP Elders Forum in Delta State, said such words of glory coming from Ayu could count for so much since Ayu was not known for frivolous talks. “We in Delta State know what Governor Okowa stands for,” Okocha said. He added: “The governor is a great performer. This is the reason he could put on ground those great infrastructures that bewildered Ayu. I mean Okowa is usually at work without making noise. This is what Ayu saw on ground and he couldn’t help but make those sound comments.”   IPC raises concerns over press freedom violation     Olawepo-Hashim joins presidential race      Uba battles Ozigbo for PDP South senatorial ticket in…   Okocha said it was noteworthy for Ayu to have mentioned that while bigwigs in the PDP were hauling over one another “over touchy issue of who becomes President, Governor Okowa maintained his cool and kept on preaching oneness in the party.” “Without any gainsaying, Governor Okowa is much more qualified than those picking tickets to become president,” he said. “You can imagine the manner he kept his cool while serving the party in bigger area of maintaining peace and unity in the party.
