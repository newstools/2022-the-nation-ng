The media outlet gathered the idea of asking for a €100 million is largely due to the fact that 30% of whatever is gotten from the sale of the forward will go to his former club Lille as agreed in the deal that saw him join Napoli  two seasons ago. Incidentally, La Gazzetta dello Sport reported in April that Osimhen was open to joining the Arsenal , but only if they qualified for the Champions League. However, the Premier League side is now two points behind Antonio Conte’s Tottenham in fourth place with just one game remaining.
