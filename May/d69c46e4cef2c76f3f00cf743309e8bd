Segun Arinze, who was spotted on the set of the film noted that the film poked at the issues of gender while stating that it’s a movie that would resonate with a major part of the society. “The movie talks about battering, about the female child getting involved in sexual malice. It is a movie that reminds us why we need to put a strong focus on the girl child.”   Biodun Stephen’s new flick, Strangers, premieres today     Bob-Manuel Udokwu: Fame once got me upgraded seat on…     ‘Ushers are not prostitutes’   Ahead of the release, Omoefe opened up on the storyline saying the film is an intriguing story of how issues concerning the girl child should be managed. He also noted that the script is crafted to leave the viewers to decide what’s best for the film’s protagonist. Speaking on the choice of the actors, Oghre-Imobhio remarked that she is working with the finest hands. “First, Bimbo Akintola is someone I have worked with before. I think I directed her very first movie many years ago. She is a director’s daylight. She is not someone that would give you problems at all. For Bimbo Manuel it is the same thing too. I have known him since I was a child. He has been able to give us the right interpretation. This setting is unusual. It’s not the kind of setting I have had with them before but it is not difficult getting them into this role. The beautiful thing about them is that they all want to be directed. That’s an enjoyable experience for every director too.”
