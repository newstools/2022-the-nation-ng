A chieftain of Ohanaeze Ndigbo in Lagos State, Chief Livinus Okwara, has commended President Mohammadu Buhari’s administration for completing the second Niger Bridge which the previous administration could not complete. In an interview Chief Okwara, who was recently conferred a title as First Father of Ohanaeze Lagos State by High Chief Solomon Ogbonna Aguene, President Ohanaeze Lagos, maintained that the completion of the bridge will add value to the people of the Southeast and increase the economy. “The completion of the second Niger bridge would ease traffic in the southeast and facilitate business transactions for the teaming Igbo business men and women,” he said.

In his words, “Let’s flash back on civil war. The Igbos lost so many things because of the civil war, Igbo never expected it, suddenly, it came, by the time people wanted to stop it, it had gone far. So we have found ourselves in position where we are no longer the bride, my advice is that we should be conscious of what happened during the civil war and learn. “Igbo man must not fight war the second time, because if we do try that, it will take over 50 years to recover back, Igbo are everywhere in Nigeria, everywhere in the world, Igbos are progressive people anywhere they find themselves.”
