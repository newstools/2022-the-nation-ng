The Commercial Agriculture for Smallholders and Agribusiness (CASA) programme has estimated that about 220,000 agri-business small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Sub Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia need about $106 billion to meet their business demand. The CASA programme is a flagship programme of the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) and is intended to increase global investment in agribusinesses which trade with smallholders in equitable commercial relationships, increasing smallholders’ incomes and climate resilience. In the report, ‘The state of the agri-SME sector –  Bridging the finance gap, CASA noted that out of $160 billion financing requirements, banks, impact investors and other financial intermediaries were able to provide only  $54 billion. The report stated that almost all climate funding is targeted at mitigation measures, rather than supporting ways to for agriculture to adapt to the climate crisis with less than two per cent of global climate finance – or  $10 billion – being channelled to small-scale agriculture.

CASA listed   challenges confronting agri-SMEs to  include high costs of doing business, high perceptions of risk in agricultural markets and low levels of investment readiness amongst potential borrowers and the high costs for borrowers to service these loans. The report noted that significant and impending investment was needed to build resilient supply chains with adaptation to climate change, is met with a negligible capital flow towards agri-SMEs. It maintained: “Even if funds were made available, the infrastructure required to channel the finance to where they are needed, is not currently available. Increasingly sophisticated blended finance approaches and the use of specialised funds has opened up a range of potential mechanisms to drive investment towards agri-SMEs but there needs to be greater understanding of the costs of subsidising these tools.”
