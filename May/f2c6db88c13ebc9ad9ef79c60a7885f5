The Peoples Democratic Party in Ekiti State has warned the All Progressives Congress (APC) led government against rigging the June 18 governorship election. The party said it would mount legitimate resistance to anything short of transparent, free and credible election. A statement yesterday by the spokesman, Raphael Adeyanju, said the party will not allow a repeat of the alleged rigging which characterised the July 14, 2018 election. According to Adeyanju, allegations by former APC National Chairman, Adams Oshiomole, that Governor Kayode Fayemi once approached him to rig an election, has confirmed its position that ‘Governor Fayemi is an election rigger and never a democrat’.

Adeyanju said: “Their leopard can never change its spots, but the electorate should be firm and demonstrate that no power can subdue the real will power of the people. They are determined to free themselves from vestiges of hunger and insecurity created by APC’s clueless government.” The party spokesman stressed that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) should be allowed to perform its constitutional duty without any hindrance and intimidation from security agencies and interested parties. He also called on the electorate to be watchful of their votes, not be deterred and intimidated by any criminal tendencies of the APC ‘which must be voted out of government at all cost’. Adeyanju urged the people to vote for the PDP candidate, Otunba Bisi Kolawole, saying he was the only credible candidate among the hopefuls that would liberate the state if elected.
