Osun Governor Adegboyega Oyetola has said he is not ready to engage in “fire for fire politics ” that some have declared ahead of the forthcoming July 16 governorship election. Oyetola said the desperation of some politicians in their campaign to engage in do-or-die politics was not in his character.

Represented by his Special Adviser on Civic Engagement, Olatunbosun Oyintiloye, the Governor said that he would rather engage in issue-based discussions on his achievements and prospects ahead and will not involve in campaign of calumny. Oyetola further said that the continuation of the various developmental projects he had embarked on since inception of his administration was the reason for his re-election campaign. He also opined that only those who lacked basic knowledge of governance, would always see election as a thug of war. Oyetola, however, said that he was optimistic of winning the election, and called for a free and fair poll. Oyetola, who noted that his achievements in all sectors of the state economy would speak for him and ensure his re-election, stressed that the masses were also behind him. The Governor said as part his commitment to youths engagement his administration as started a process of enrolling 30,000 vulnerable youths into Health Insurance Scheme(OHIS). He also said that government had kick started massive recruitment of youths into Osun Youth Employment Scheme, popularly called (O’YES).
