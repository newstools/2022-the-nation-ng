A presidential aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mr. Peter Obi, yesterday said Nigeria did not need wealth consumers as leaders. The former Anambra State governor, who spoke in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, during a consultative meeting with the state chapter of the PDP, said Nigeria required wealth creators. Obi said the era of sharing the country’s resources in the guise of politics was over, adding that there was nothing to share anymore. He said the nation needed another group of leaders who must emerge to produce resources to take care of the next generation. Obi listed key areas to tackle in the economy such as education, security, power generation and manufacturing to reposition the nation for greater heights.
