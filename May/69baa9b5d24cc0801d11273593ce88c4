I don’t know if I will still want to do music some other time. But owning a production company and switching from music to a Video Producer/Director is the best for me right now. Aside from that, I’ve always wanted to do more. “I see beyond singing and writing. I visualize pictures when I am writing and I have always wanted to give back to the people and the industry. So with my visual production company, I could help up and known artists achieve their dreams.” Johnson also opened up on the challenges of filming Portable’s latest music video ‘Clear’ in the heart of Maryland, Lagos. Speaking on the challenges, he said, “It was a crazy experience. Because I took the video to the street. The mainstream of Maryland and all the boys in the hood came out. Some people came from Ikeja, Ojota, etc, and guess what… There was no single security, I had to deal with all of this. Working with portable is a movie, I have never gone through that stress before in my life. I had to deal with over 3 thousand boys on the street all because I am shooting a music video for Portable.”
