Despite coming under attack in recent weeks, over Nigeria’s withdrawal from participating in international basketball, the minister of Youth and Sports, Sunday Dare has described the industry as one big family. The minister was yesterday presented bags of rice by the Sports Writer Association of Nigeria (SWAN) FCT chapter, as part of their Easter and Eid-El-Fitr gifts which were also extended to members. FCT SWAN Chairman, Bunmi Haruna, who was in the company of some members said they see the minister as part of the SWAN family and will continue to support him to succeed in office. “We don’t have much, but from the little we have as an association, we have come to share with you.

This shows we are one big family, I thank SWAN for this gesture.” The minister also spoke on the withdrawal of Nigerian teams from participating in international basketball for two years. “The true basketball stakeholders know that the ministry is not the problem, they know where the problem Is,” Dare said. The SWAN, FCT chapter had last month shared close to 100 bags of rice to members as Easter and Sallah packages.
