Chelsea all but secured a third-place finish in the Premier League with a draw against Leicester at Stamford Bridge. The Blues, beaten in the FA Cup final by Liverpool at the weekend, fell behind early on when James Maddison curled a fine effort beyond goalkeeper Edouard Mendy. However, Marcos Alonso equalised towards the end of the first half when he was picked out superbly by Reece James and volleyed in. Chelsea dominated the second half and had numerous chances to take all three points.
