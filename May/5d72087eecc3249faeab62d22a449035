According to the chairman of the board of AVRS, Mr. Mahmood Ali-Balogun: “History is upon us. Nigeria will tell us whether the likes of Transcorp Hilton are right to totally disregard audiovisual rights, or trample on the rights of creative people” Last year, AVRS, who is the Nigerian Copyright Management Organisation for audiovisual works, sued the defendant for N1bn for copyright infringement and refusal to comply with copyright laws.
