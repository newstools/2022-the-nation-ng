Yet, many people struggle to save up for a long time to make this dream come true. To bridge this gap, we created a value proposition that is flexible, convenient and empowers individuals, families and businesses to achieve the dream of vehicle ownership. Nigerians can now finance their dream vehicle with an auto loan from FCMB at a low-interest rate with monthly or yearly payment options depending on their income. We, therefore, urge the populace, including, but not limited to salaried individuals, to take advantage of this opportunity to fulfill their vehicle ownership dream.” FCMB Auto Loan empowers qualified Nigerians to part-finance the purchase of brand-new and pre-owned vehicles while spreading the repayment between one and five years. The loan, which is dependent on the type of vehicle to be purchased, is open to salaried individuals and self-employed Nigerians.   ‘Protect Nigeria’s solid mineral assets’     ‘Investors need diversified portfolios to reduce risks’     FrieslandCampina WAMCO records 35% revenue growth   According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the number of registered vehicles in Nigeria is 13 million.
