The government has been urged to borrow ideas from private institutions for a safe and secure learning environment. The Head of Role Model School, Mrs. Adesimbo Banjo, said for Nigeria’s educational system to work properly, the government must be on the same page with both private and government schools. Banjo spoke at the school’s maiden edition of Friends of Role Model Schools (FORMS), a dinner party where parents and school staff familiarise with each other.

We also have very strict measures so that it’s tough for a parent to pick up a child, and all that is to make sure we don’t have issues of kidnapping or wrong persons picking up children in school. “Even before we had issues with insecurity in Nigeria, the school had always paid attention to security, ensuring the children and staff are safe. We ensure that parents have their pick up cards. If a parent is sending someone to pick up their child, there must be a letter of authorisation. “We all have to speak the same language, take decisions together and ensure the children are prioritised; ensure the training of staff is done regularly, and I feel the government needs to tap ideas from private schools.” On the purpose of FOMS, Mrs. Banjo said: “The idea behind this dinner is to bring us together; one of our core slogans is bridging the gap. This is our maiden edition and the first time ever bringing parents and teachers together in this type of setting. The school is 21 old and counting and it’s an opportunity for parents and staffs to mingle.”
