The Federal High Court (FHC) in Abuja yesterday ordered the  Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Rivers State and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC)  to show reasons why its governorship primary should hold without an embattled aspirant, Dr Farah Dagogo. Dagogo, who is a member of the House of Representatives, had dragged the PDP and  INEC to court following his exclusion from the list of aspirants in the state. He is standing trial on two-count of conspiracy to felony and cultism at the Federal High Court,  Port Harcourt.

In a motion on notice filed at the FHC, Abuja, Dagogo asked for an order of interlocutory injunction restraining the PDP from using any list of aspirants without his name to conduct the May 26  primary election pending the hearing and determination of the substantive suit. He is also seeking an order restraining INEC from accepting any candidate, who might emerge from any primary conducted without his participation. Justice Taiwo ordered the PDP and INEC to show cause today why Dagogo’s application seeking injunctive orders should not be granted.
