Veteran actress Shan George has narrated how not meeting up with Joint Admission and Matriculation Board(JAMB) cut off mark denied her ambition of being a lawyer. The actress revealed this on an Instagram live with her fans saying she has no regrets because her dream of being a voice still transpired. In her words “I wrote that wicked JAMB twice and when I could not meet up the cut off mark being that I had left secondary school so many years behind before I now started writing exam again so I could not really meet up with the cut-off mark. I would have been a lawyer, but I thank God because the reason I wanted to be a lawyer was that I wanted to have a voice, I have always desired to have a voice, and I have always desired to also be a person that will encourage others and also stand for injustice done to others and in that sense being in the job that I am today even gives me a bigger mouth at the end of the day,” she said.
