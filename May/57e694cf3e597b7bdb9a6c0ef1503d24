Nigeria’s crude oil and condensates reserves increased to 37.047billion barrels per day as at 1st January 2022 from the 36.910bbs recorded at 1st January, 2021. Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC), Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Engr. Gbenga Komolafe broke the news to reporters in Abuja on Friday. He said: “A total of sixty-one (61) operating companies submitted their 2021 annual report on reserves in line with the provisions of the PIA, 2021. “Analysis of the report indicates that the Nation’s oil and condensate reserves status as at 1st January 2022 was 37.046 Billion barrels representing a slight increase of 0.37% compared to 36.910 Billion barrels as at 1st January 2021.” According to him, on the other hand, the National Gas reserves status as of 1st January 2022 was 208.62 (trillion cubic feet) TCF, representing an increase of 1.01% compared to 206.53 TCF as at 1st January 2021.

The Commission, he said, has commenced full-scale audit of crude oil theft and assessment of upstream assets integrity audit to establish actual crude oil theft figures in the upstream petroleum industry. He attributed the audit to the recent controversial figures on theft volumes thrown up by some industry operators, which impacts negatively on Federation revenue. Komolafe noted that this was very important as the nation derives its royalty from net crude oil receipts. The CEO said the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the attendant disruptions to the global gas demand-supply chain have provided Nigeria with a unique opportunity to fill this gap through the implementation of several natural gas developmental initiatives. He also noted that the Commission since assumption of office six months ago taken some proactive initiatives towards the enhancement of crude oil and gas production, taking advantage of current market realities such as the upsurge of crude oil prices to $106.25 per barrel and disruptions in the supply of gas due to the war in Ukraine.
