The Proprietor of  the  upcoming Sports University of Nigeria in  Idumuje-Ugboko , Prince (Dr) Ned Nwoko , is confident that the execution of the project will provide a watershed in the sporting fortunes of some developing countries in order to bring competitive parity in global sports. He particularly identified Nigeria as an epicentre for deploying the institution’s innovative approaches; rooted in the modus-operandi of the trail-blazing Sports University, as against the hitherto unproductive methods, from which Nigeria could boast only three gold medals from more than a dozen Olympics appearances. The Proprietor who doubles as the institution’s Pro-Chancellor, Nwoko noted  in a mission statement,  that the Sports University of Nigeria will amongst others ‘provide education in sports services: science; medicine; management; engineering; physical education; humanities and social science, as well as to develop top-level athletes through high performance training’.
