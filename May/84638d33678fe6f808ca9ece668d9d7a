Soldiers of 14 Brigade Army Headquarters, Ohafia, Abia State, have reportedly killed gunmen suspected to be members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). The incident, our correspondent gathered, took place in the Uratta area of the Enugu-Aba-Port Harcourt Expressway yesterday. The number of the IPOB suspects killed was, however, disputed. A source claimed four members of the outlawed organisation died in a shootout but another report said one pro-Biafra agitator was killed.

The sit-at-home expected to be observed across the southeastern states, The Nation gathered, was in protest of President Muhammadu Buhari’s planned visit to Ebonyi State on Friday. The sit-at-home order was announced by gun-wielding men dressed in black. Many shoppers, who had just arrived in Aba from other parts of the country and neighbouring African regions, could not hide their fears and anger over the sit-at-home order as it was going to force them to stay beyond their planned departure date. A source at the 14 Brigade said that members of the proscribed group had a face-off with soldiers that led to the gunfight.
