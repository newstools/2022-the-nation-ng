Claim by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) of a ploy to extend President Muhammadu Buhari’s tenure is a diversionary tactic in the aftermath of the crisis that trailed its primaries at the weekend, the Buhari Media Organisation (BMO) has said. It said it was irresponsible of the opposition party to concoct a plot out of the President’s delay in signing a further amendment to the Electoral Act 2022 at a time its primary election was marred by irregularities. In a statement by its Chairman, Niyi Akinsiju and Secretary, Cassidy Madueke, the group said it was shocking that barely 24 hours after PDP, through its National Organising Secretary, Umar Bature, released guidelines for its primaries, “the party spokesman Debo Ologunagba threw caution to the wind with a spurious claim of a tenure elongation plot over the recently passed amendment to the Electoral Act that the President has yet to give his assent to. “For us, there is no explanation for this volte-face other than the harvest of crisis and drama that trailed the PDP primaries across the country.

BMO wondered why any individual or group could hold the Presidency responsible for what the National Assembly had since described as an unintended error.
