Super Eagles star Alex Iwobi made his eighth consecutive start and provided an assist as Frank Lampard’s Everton took a huge step towards safety after they recorded a 2-1 win over Leicester City at the King Power Stadium yesterday being their first away win in the English Premier League since August. Iwobi, playing as a right wing-back, provided Vitaliy Mykolenko with a superb cross which the Ukrainian volleyed in the sixth minute to put the Evertonians 1-0 up. But the Toffees’ lead lasted five minutes as Patson Daka made the most of a defensive mix-up to equalise for Leicester City but at the half-hour mark, Mason Holgate forced the ball in after a goalkeeping error by Kasper Schmeichel to put Everton back in front. Meanwhile, Europa Conference League top-scorer Cyriel Dessers delivered another memorable performance to help Feyenoord come from two goals down to draw 2-2 against title-chasing Eindhoven in their week 32 Eredivisie clash yesterday.

It was the Belgium-born striker’s seventh and eighth league goals of the season. He has 19 goals in all competitions. In La Liga, it was a disappointing afternoon for Samuel Chukwueze, as his Villarreal side was held to a 1-1 draw at home to Sevilla.
