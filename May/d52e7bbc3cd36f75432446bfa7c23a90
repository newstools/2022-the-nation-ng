Veteran rapper Michael Stephens aka Ruggedman has said that the urge to celebrate Nigerian entertainers regularly ignited his recent endeavour, the Foundation Night. Ruggedman made this known during a chat with The Nation at the just concluded Foundation Night which was held at Club Pluto, Lekki, Lagos. The rap act noted that, unlike the Foundation concert which holds annually, Foundation Night would celebrate veteran musicians mixed with new generation artists on a monthly basis. He avowed that the aim of the gig is to be the go-to spot for classic evergreen songs.

So that’s what foundation night is about. “I like to grow things organically so I am building this from the ground up the same way I am building Foundation Concert from the ground up. It’s going to be artists from my time but of course, supported by younger artists. “Next month which is June, I have Cynthia Morgan, and already taking with one more person that is gonna come on with Cynthia Morgan. I already have Reminisce for July so it’s gonna be monthly and it’s going to be fun.” He also discussed the need for support from colleagues and brands to make the big plans a reality.
