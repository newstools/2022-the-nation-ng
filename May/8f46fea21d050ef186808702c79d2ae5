THE National Association of Nigeria Nurses and Midwives (NANNM) on Friday decried the low investment and poor welfare for nurses and midwives across the country. It disclosed that due to a sundry of reasons, including  attacks, victimization, low remuneration, insecurity etc., over 5,000 nurses have left the country to developed countries in three years (between 2019 to 2022), while over 5,000 lost their lives to COVID-19 while in the line of duty in 2020. The Association therefore urged the government on the need to protect, support and invest in the nursing profession, which will enable the country achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

He said: “Despite the commitment and sacrifices demonstrated by nurses and midwives, they are yet to be adequately compensated, recognized, valued, and respected, so as to be given the pride of place in the society. “Frontline health workers are most vulnerable to risk. Worthy of note is that over 5,000 Nurses and Midwives lost their lives during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.”
