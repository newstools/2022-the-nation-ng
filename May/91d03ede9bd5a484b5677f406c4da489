However, seven minutes later Wydad centre-back Amine Ferhane headed home an equaliser from a corner. Petro had more possession after that but could not score again in front of a huge, vocal, largely red-clad home crowd. Two-time winners Wydad are into the Champions League final for the fifth time – with their most recent appearance in 2019, when they lost to Esperance of Tunisia.
