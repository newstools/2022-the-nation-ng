Gunmen terrorising and killing in Anambra State have threatened to cause more mayhem in the weeks ahead if residents continue to ignore the sit-at-home order. But Governor Chukwuma Soludo assured he was working toward the enthronement of peace and security in the State. Soludo spoke during the second session of the 6th Synod of the Diocese of Aguata, Anglican Communion. The gunmen, in a statement in Awka, warned that residents should respect the sit-at-home order or face the consequences.

Commercial buses, tricycle operators and motorcycle operators observed the sit-at-home from Awka to Onitsha, Ekwulobia and Nnewi Cities. The statement sighted by The Nation reads: “Since you people don’t want to respect our order because of what your leaders are telling you, wait and see in the next few weeks. “We are going to visit some local government areas to tell the people how serious we are. Everybody will feel it soon. We are not going to talk about it again.”
