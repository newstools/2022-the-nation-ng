Dr. Kabiru further said that “if Bauchi governor, Bala Mohammed participates in the presidential primary election and loses, and comes back to claim the state PDP Gubernatorial ticket, then we have more reason to believe that we were denied participation in the screening and primary election deliberately because of him.” When contacted, the state Publicity Secretary of the PDP,  Yayanuwa Zainabari, said he is not aware that Ahmed junior is contesting for any seat, adding that the party only knows of Kashim as the only aspirant who purchased the PDP governorship nomination and expression of interest forms.
