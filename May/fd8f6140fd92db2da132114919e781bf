Popular Ghanaian actress Juliet Ibrahim has recounted her ordeals with an abusive partner who never saw his act as wrong. The bi-racial media personality famous for her roles in Nollywood movies revealed in an interview with Chude Jideonwo how she was locked up for days by her ex-boyfriend and raped daily. Even though there was never a mutual consent, Ibrahim stated her ex-lover would still have s3xual relations with her. Afterwards, he would tell her it wasn’t rape because they were in a relationship. The movie star said: “I told him what he did was rape and he said but we were in a relationship. “But was I ready, that was the question, did I say I was in the mood? I kept saying no, stop it, stop it, you pin me down and you’re doing whatever you wanted to do and you’re smiling saying don’t worry.

He can raise you above the wall. And just imagine that it was every day. Every day, he wanted to do something. That is rape.” The 36-year-old curvy actress further advised women in any form of abusive relationship especially that which involves rape to draw courage and report their partners to appropriate authorities. “You’re naive. Who do you go and tell? Who would come and fight for you? “But ladies you can report it now, go and report. If your husband is forcing you to do when you’re not in the mood it is rape and I tell these men that you cannot force a woman.”
