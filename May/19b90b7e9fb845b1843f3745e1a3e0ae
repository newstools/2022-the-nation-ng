The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has distributed 95 per cent of non-sensitive materials to the 16 local government areas of Ekiti State. Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) Dr Adeniran Tella stated this during a road-show to sensitise residents on the need to be peaceful before, during and after the election. Tella explained that the distribution was to enable the councils prepare well and ensure smooth conduct of the election. He added that the sensitive materials would be dispatched 24 hours before the election.

He added that such officers, including INEC staff, corps members and youths, were currently undergoing series of trainings ahead of the poll. He added: “We are fully prepared for the poll. We have gotten about 95 per cent full components of non-sensitive materials deployed and dispatched to our local government area and the registration area units. “I have gone round and we have asked the people for cooperation to ensure peace reigns during the election. We have equally given them our word to ensure that the people’s vote count. With the structures we have put in place, the votes must count.” Tella also hoped that INEC would not disappoint residents, saying all necessary human, material and managerial resources will be deployed to ensure the election remained credible and transparent.
