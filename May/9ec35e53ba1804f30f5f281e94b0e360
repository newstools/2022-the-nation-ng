Kylian Mbappe will reportedly announce his eagerly-anticipated next move this weekend. The France international’s lucrative contract with Paris Saint-Germain is set to expire at the end of the season. The coveted Mbappe has remained tight-lipped on his next move but will reportedly break his silence on his future tomorrow.   Tuchell warns Man United to stay off Kante     ‘Blood, sweat and tears’ pay off for ABRAHAM     Ancelotti: ‘I think about Liverpool, not Mbappé’   That’s according to L’Equipe, who claimed  the World Cup winner will spill the beans at 10am BST. Mbappe’s planned announcement has drawn comparisons to LeBron James’ announcing of his 2012 move to the Miami Heat. The future NBA Hall of Famer kept basketball fans on tenterhooks with an hour-and-half-long show – which was fittingly named ‘The Decision’ – to announce his departure from the Cleveland Cavaliers. Mbappe is unlikely to leave PSG supporters hanging around for that long, although the footy fans around the world will be waiting with bated breath hear his decision. Former Monaco hitman Mbappe is a long-term target of La Liga giants Real Madrid, who have reportedly agreed personal terms with the 23-year-old.
