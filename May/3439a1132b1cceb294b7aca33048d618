ITTF Africa Cup Women’s  Singles runner-up, Fatimo Bello,  has credited her elder brother  for her  impressive outing at the continental championship. Bello defeated number four seed Offiong Edem in the quarter-final  and  edged out African champions Mariam Alhodaby of Egypt in the semi-final to qualify for the final where she eventually lost 4-0 to teenage sensation,  Hana Goda of Egypt. “I trained well for the tournaments, especially with my brother,” she said.“We trained regularly together and  worked hard day and night;  and this paid off for me in the competition because I didn’t  expect I would get to the final.” Bello who set a record as a three-time winner of the Western Region championship, is confident  her performance at the Africa Cup would improve her  world rating when the  ranking is released  today by  ITTF.

The three-day tournament had 48 players (28 men and 20 women) across Africa competing in the men’s and women’s singles events.
