Noting three species found in Nigeria, white-bellied, black bellies and the giant ground pangolins, he advised Nations to setup rules and laws against the killings and illegal trade of the mammal saying “you can’t conserve them by killing them”. Current Chairman IUCN pangolin Special groups, Dr. Matthew Shirley said if a specie eat the wrong diet its would cause infection and lead to death because the nutritional needs of each species are different. He noted that Taiwan has come up with an artificial diet that can serve the mammals regardless of its specie.
