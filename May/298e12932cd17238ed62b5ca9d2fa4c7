Our opponents played their part in an eventful game and we won. Our aim is to retain the title despite having good teams in the league. “The players are fatigued having just participated in the Winners’ Cup in Niger Republic. We also have players who are injured but that would not stop us from realising our ambition. It is good to start with a win and hopefully it will put us in good stead as the league progresses,” Yola added.
