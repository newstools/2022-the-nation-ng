Gov. Charles Soludo of Anambra wrote to the House of Assembly on Thursday to receive him on Friday as he planned to present a 2022 revised draft budget. Speaker of the House, Mr Uche Okafor, announced the date while reading the letter from the governor at Thursday’s plenary session. In the letter, the governor thanked the lawmakers for their support and urged them to allow him to perform his constitutional duty. The speaker said, however, that he would reply to the governor to ask for another date as the proposed date of Friday, May 6, would not be convenient. “May 6, is Friday and with the look of things, it will not be convenient to receive the governor, I will, therefore, communicate with the governor’s office to agree on a new date which will be communicated to members,’’ he said.
