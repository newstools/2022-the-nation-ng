Dominic King has been full of praise for Alex Iwobi’s performance as Everton won 1-0 at home to Chelsea in the Premier League this afternoon. It was a big win for the hosts at Goodison Park as they climbed to within two points of both Leeds United and Burnley in the table, courtesy of a goal from Richarlison in the early second-half exchanges. The Toffees still have a game in hand on their two relegation rivals as well, so their destiny is still in their hands. Daily Mail journalist King was especially pleased with Iwobi’s performance, claiming on Twitter that the 25-year-old may have gone ‘under the radar’ given some huge saves that Jordan Pickford made in the second half.

He’s a player Frank Lampard loves because of his attitude and determination to play wherever for the team. He hasn’t put a foot out of place, superb.” Like the rest of the team, Iwobi put in a huge shift for Everton to ensure that they took all three points on Merseyside.   The former Arsenal ace won four of his duels in total and also recorded one successful dribble, three clearances, one interception, two tackles, one key pass, and three accurate long balls (SofaScore).   He had 47 touches of the ball in total, more than any of his teammates, showing his bravery to get his team out of tight situations in what would have been much appreciated by Lampard and the supporters, as King pointed out.
