Lagos residents have called for stiffer measures to check the growing trend of underage persons allowed access to hotels, alcohol and drugs. A cross-section of residents in the metropolis who spoke with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in separate interviews yesterday, said the responsibility to check the act rests majorly on parents. Mrs Opeyemi Adebayo, a teacher, said that the family has a major role to play on deciding how a child would turn out or behave in the society. “Parents need to spend more time with their children, yes Lagos stress is there but you should create time to monitor the activities of your children since you are capable of bringing them to the world.

Parents should also be good examples because children mostly display outside, what they see or learn from home,” she said. Mr Samuel Oseni, a clergy, told NAN that children should be taught in the way of the Lord so that the society would be a better place for all. “The Sunday schools are there to teach these children what they may not teach them in school. Teach them to be better persons and set good examples while at home with them,” he said. “It should be strongly implemented by the government that before allowing one entry into a pub, club or a hotel, the ID card should be checked to be sure that such a person has attained the required age limit to enable them visit such environment,” Mr Chijioke Nwokonko, a lecturer in Ogun, said. “But there are instances where these underage children already have strong influences; they can call the manager to gain access and make the security man asking for ID card look useless.”
