I came from Warri, I came farther than everybody to make it. When I first started making rap music they told me since you were born have you seen anybody from the south-south that made it doing rap music?” Continuing, he said, “But it is already working for me, I didn’t see any Nigerian rapper on Rolling Loud, the biggest hip hop festival in the world, I don’t want to bring tribalism into this thing but I know for a fact if it was somebody else that performed on that same Rolling Loud stage, in front of 25,000 Americans, unreleased records it is going to be something else, they are going to make it look like something else but I know my journey, I know my support system and I’m going to keep on going okay at the end of the day is all about building the culture.”
