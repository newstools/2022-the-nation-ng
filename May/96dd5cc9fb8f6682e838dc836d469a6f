Oloyede, represented by JAMB’s Director, Legal Services, Dr. AbdulWahab Oyedokun, said the board had taken measures to ensure total sanity in its examination processes. He listed some of the measures as the deployment of sophisticated biometric technology to curb multiple registrations in Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME). The JAMB registrar said the board had taken another major step to put an end to use of fake ‘A’ Level certificates to secure admission. “In the last one year and in the second coming of Prof. Oloyede as registrar of JAMB, one of the major assignments we did here was to focus on some of the things that are happening in these JUPEB and IJMB.”
