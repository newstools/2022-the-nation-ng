Star couple, Simi and Adekunle Gold on Monday took to their social media pages to celebrate their daughter’s birthday. The duo were married in 2019 with about 300 selected guests at their white wedding and welcomed their first child, Adejara Kosoko in May 2020. The “Duduke” singer in her post via her Instagram page, shared a video compilation of some precious ‘mother-daughter’ moments. Captioning her post, the proud mother showered prayers on her daughter who she described as her twin while reiterating how much she’s loved. Simi wrote: “My baby. My twin. You’re a wonder. You’re everything I prayed for and then much more. If I start to mention them now, it will turn to bragging. But I don’t love you because of how smart you are. I love you because you are the light of my life.
