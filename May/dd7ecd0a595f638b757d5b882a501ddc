Sunflower oil is majorly supplied by Russia and Ukraine and due to the extremely high prices, crude palm which is its close substitute to this commodity would be in strong demand. Additionally, it is one of the items on the central bank’s import restricted items; it has strong demand by producers as well as individual and home consumption. Presco being one of the two major players in this space will see their profits rise in a few years to come, starting from this year,” Arthur Stevens stated.
