Manchester City announced yesterday they had reached an agreement to sign star striker Erling Haaland from Borussia Dortmund – sending an ominous statement of intent to their rivals. The Norwegian international will move to the Etihad after the Premier League champions agreed to pay his reported 60-million-euro (£51 million, $63 million) release clause. “Manchester City can confirm we have reached an agreement in principle with Borussia Dortmund for the transfer of striker Erling Haaland to the club on 1st July 2022,” the club said in a statement. “The transfer remains subject to the club finalising terms with the player.” The deal for the towering 21-year-old ends City’s long search for a specialist striker to replace record goalscorer Sergio Aguero, who left last year.

Haaland, whose father Alf-Inge played for City from 2000 to 2003, has been sensational since joining Dortmund from RB Salzburg in January 2020, scoring 85 goals in 88 appearances for the German side. Speculation linking City with Haaland had been gathering momentum in recent weeks, with reports on Monday claiming the player had already undergone a medical. Manager Pep Guardiola was reluctant to discuss the situation in a press conference to preview today’s game at Wolves, but all but suggested a deal was imminent. “Everybody knows the situation, but I should not talk because I do not like to talk about the future, next season,” he said. “At the same time I should say something, but Borussia Dortmund and Man City told me I’m not allowed to say anything until the deal is completely done, so I cannot talk. I’m sorry. We’ll have time to talk.”
