The Obong of sankwala crooner, Longe David Ubu Junior aka ‘Jaro Davids’ has dedicated his new EP to Obanliku local government in Cross River State on the need for development. The project, which packs five solid tracks, is the singer’s first long anticipated official EP as a couple of singles from the EP were available on platforms for his listeners prior to the studio release. Jaro Davids is known to many as a results-oriented individual with the right measure to overcome challenges. The singer said the EP is used to protest the poor representation displayed by the government on matters of development in his hometown.

That is why I am using this EP to also protest the poor representation displayed by the government,” he said. The EP, which is garnering streams on all digital platforms worldwide, is a rolling stone already set in motion to achieve results once thought of as herculean.
