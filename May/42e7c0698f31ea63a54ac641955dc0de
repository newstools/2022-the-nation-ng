If you have followed my mantra since I started this, I have always said (that) the greatest tragedy of our country today, is consumption and no production; it is sharing and not creating. “I said I want to move the country from consumption (nation) to production (nation). I have moved to where I think the process will allow me. It is not about winning or losing. I will rather lose doing the right thing than win doing the wrong thing. “My politics have been consistent in character and integrity since I started.
