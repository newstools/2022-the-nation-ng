A Non-Governmental Organisation, A Mother’s Love Initiative (AMLi), has called for greater attention on the boy-child. To mark 2022 International Day of the Boy-Child, celebrated May 16, it held a symposium and essay competition for secondary schools and tertiary institutions to amplify campaigns against neglect of the boy-child. Chief Executive Officer of AMLi Hanatu Enwemadu lamented that the boy-child was becoming invisible because the ‘society assumes they are invincible’. They are hurried through childhood into adulthood, and taught to mask their pains as they must hide their tears because showing pains is a sign of weakness. This, she describes as a ‘social but subtle bias against the boy-child’.

Such stereotypes reflect degrees of the onslaught of trauma meted on the boy-child by society. These have adverse effects on the psychosocial balance and development of the boy-child. If we do not fix these anomalies and reverse the imbalance, these young ones may turn abusive in future. “That is why in line with our ‘Committing to Fatherhood’, we asked the boy-child at all levels to send in essays, titled: The Father and Son Relationship from the lens of the Boy-Child, based on their relationships with their fathers. “We, at AMLi, call on all  to lend their voice against the unfair balance and neglect of the boy-child, and create more platforms and resources to promote the interests and wellbeing of the boy-child, as well as salvage their waning posture and position in society. “We will not relent until our children in Nigeria and across the continent are groomed to become responsible citizens.” Participants in the competition were 18 universities and 12 secondary schools. There were six winners and they will be awarded prizes on June 16, which is Father’s Day.
