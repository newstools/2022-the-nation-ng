A former guber aspirant of the All Progressives Congress(APC) in Akwa Ibom, Professor Chris Ekong has slammed those opposed to the emergence of Obong Akan Udofia as governorship candidate of the party. Ekong said those against Udofia do not mean well for the electoral fortunes of the APC in next year’s election. Udofia polled a total of 1227 votes to beat his closest contender, Senator Ita Enang who scored 34 votes. Prof Ekong followed with 21 votes, Uduak Udoh 7 votes, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe 2 votes, Richard Anana 2 votes, Larry Esin 1 vote and Augustine Utuk 0. There were 19 voided votes.   Calls for cancellation, rerun of primary uncalled for-Rep     Tambuwal: What manner of hero?     Senator Ubah wins YPP’s return ticket   One of the aspirants, Senator Ita Enang last Saturday rejected Udofia as governorship candidate of the APC, saying the primary which took place last Friday at the State party’s office 6 Ekpo Street Uyo, was fraught with irregularities and fraud. But Prof Ekong in a press conference at the Correspondents’ Chapel yesterday grievances against Udofia’s emergence were needless and baseless. He said, “But in a most unremarkable sense, though not entirely surprising, incidents that have since gained momentum after this epochal exercise have left us with more than what is desired. “Sadly, these originate from, otherwise, somewhat very respectable politicians and great party men. A fair segment of our party men and compatriots have so far reflected an unimaginable proportion of needless grievances by electing to voice their perceived rejection and outcome of that free and considerably a fair rated exercise. “The protest convention always aimed at weakening our party prior to elections must in this consideration be stoutly resisted by all devoted members of our great All Progressives Congress in Akwa Ibom State.”
