The President of the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS), Sunday Asefon, yesterday said the union was prepared to hit the streets to protest the strike embarked on by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU). Asefon, who spoke during an interview with Channels Television’s Sunrise Daily, lamented that the Federal Government appeared not to be interested in ending the strike, as it was focusing on the coming 2023 general election. He urged the government to stop playing politics with the ASUU issue and resolve the prolonged strike.

Rather, their focus now is on election because of their selfish interest. “We are battle ready; the worst they can do is to shoot us. If they ask their police to shoot us, if we die, the generation coming will know we died because of fighting for them. They will also know that they shot us because they were preparing for election. We need to take action now.”
