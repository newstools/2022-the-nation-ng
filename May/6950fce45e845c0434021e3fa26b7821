Boxing promoter Bob Arum claimed  Tyson Fury could come out of retirement to face the winner of Anthony Joshua and Oleksandr Usyk But his US-based promoter Arum believes WBC world heavyweight champion Fury, 33, will “wait to see” the outcome of Joshua’s rematch with WBA, IBF, WBO and IBO champ Usyk. Speaking to Fight Hype, Arum said: “Well, I think Fury is going to wait to see how the Joshua fight comes out with Usyk and then he’ll make a determination whether he wants to continue. “Other than fighting the winner of Joshua-Usyk, there’s really nothing that’s really of interest to Tyson Fury, so we will have to see.” Joshua is due to fight Usyk in a bid to reclaim the heavyweight titles on July 23. Matchroom chief Eddie Hearn explained: “There is not a problem now but if it is not announced next week then it could be put back a week or two.

Beyond that we will have to move it back a week or two.” He added: “If we go July 23 then we are nine weeks away and we need to announce next week, it has to be next week. “They will want us to do a media tour, we would have to go to the Middle East and London, maybe even New York, so we really need to announce next week.”
