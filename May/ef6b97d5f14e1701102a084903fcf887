A remorseful mother of four, Josephine Adun, has been arrested with a human skull in Benin, Edo State. Adun, a divorcee, spoke when she was paraded by police yesterday alongside 16 other suspects. She said: “I want to use this medium to advise other women not to sell human parts to anybody, no matter how much the person promises to give. I have learnt my lessons.” One Goodluck Charity sought to buy a human skull from her, which she sold to him for N40,000, having bought it for N8,000 from someone else, she said.

Charity said a herbalist asked him to get the skull for money ritual. The herbalist, Olusola Oyowokemi, who was also arrested, corroborated Chjarity’s story. Edo Police Commissioner, Abutu Yaro, said that criminals will not be allowed to take over the state.
