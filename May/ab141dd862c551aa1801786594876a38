Flykite Productions, organisers of GOtv Boxing Night, have defended the choice of Ibadan as venue for the 25th edition of the event to be held on 4th  June at the Old Gymnasium of the Obafemi Awolowo Stadium. In a statement issued in Lagos on Thursday, the sports promotions company explained that the choice of the Oyo State capital was a product of consultations with boxing stakeholders and arose from the desire to make other parts of the country have a taste of the event.

He said:“Ibadan was where the sponsors launched GOtv service in 2011 and was the host city of the first boxing world title bout in August 1963 when Nigeria’s Dick Tiger defeated America’s Gene Fullmer to retain the middleweight belt at the Liberty Stadium in front of over 35,000 fans.
