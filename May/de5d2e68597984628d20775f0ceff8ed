The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) on Friday signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) to engage corps members in all 774 local government areas (LGAs) in the country. According to the MoU, the corps members will be involved in sensitisation and education of community members on making healthy choices concerning what they consume, especially in NAFDAC’s efforts to reduce substandard, fake, and counterfeit products, and also help Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) understand the processes of the agency, such as registration and regulatory processes.

She said: “We have been working on this for three years to make sure NAFDAC is seen at the local government level. It is important because of the health of our people and the trade that our people do, that is, MSMEs. MSMEs are the ones that drive the economy, hence, they need to be supported to grow. “Having NAFDAC desks at the 774 LGAs will bring NAFDAC closer to the people. We need to sensitize our people, take questions, etc. This initiative is to make sure that our processes are well understood through the corps members. It is also to make sure that MSMEs questions are taken care of.”
