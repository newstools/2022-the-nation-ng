The Okpekpe race is returning after suffering two Covid-induced postponements in 2020 and 2021 and organisers have promised a better and bigger race this year to be in line with its new classification as an elite label race. The quality of elite athletes that will be competing for the top $20,000 prize money is the best so far assembled and will be led by Ethiopia’s Yasin Haji who ran 27:00 under two months ago in Lille, France to jump into the world top 10 list of performances so far this year and  Kenya’s Sandrafelis Chebet Tuei who has improved her best from the 30.57 she ran in January 2018 to 30:45 last October at the 10K Valencia Ibercaja in Valencia, Spain. This year’s race, the eighth edition will start in Apama Road and ends in the rural, rustic town of Okpekpe famous for its position on the hill top in the Edo North Senatorial district and its huge agricultural and investment potential and quite a suitable tourism destination. The race is organised by Pamodzi Sports Marketing, a leader in sports marketing, sponsorship, hospitality and rights acquisition business with operations in Nigeria
