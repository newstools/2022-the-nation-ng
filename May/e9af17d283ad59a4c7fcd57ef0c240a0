Afrobeats singer Davido has alleged the promoter of a show he is billed to perform in Italy has not paid the balance of his fee. The distraught music star accused the promoter of taking his craft and hard work for granted by not honouring the contractual agreement. He wrote: “We overwork our bodies, blood sweat and tears daily to keep up and deliver these shows for our fans, only for people to take our craft and hard work for granted. “I fly private 90 percent of the time but due to logistic issues we couldn’t get a landing permit on time.   Promoter Baddyoosha takes Olamide, Asake to Dubai     Summer body without summer money worthless-Cubana Chief…     I never slept with your friend, ex-husband replies Kaffy   “So I even the decided to take almost three connecting flights to get here. We get here and promoter has did not keep up to his own part of the agreement.” The DMW boss explained hours after arriving at the hotel in Italy, he waited for his balance to no avail despite the fact that the promoter has sold thousands of tickets . Davido said: “He has sold thousands of tickets but doesn’t want to pay me! Normally it’s no balance, no show. “I’ve been at the hotel for the past four hours waiting for either cash or a wire…still nothing!” Vowing to ensure the fans efforts to see him perform doesn’t go to waste, the “Stand Strong” singer added; “I know how many people used their last to see me! So because of that I will do the show!!”
