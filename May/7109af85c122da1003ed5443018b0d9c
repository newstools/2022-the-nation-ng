With seven days to go to the eighth edition of the World Athletics Elite Label Okpekpe international 10km road race, Pamodzi Sports Marketing, organisers of the historic race said this year’s edition will be the biggest ever in terms of its organisation and quality of its elite cast. Race director Zack Amodu said arrangements have been concluded for a hitch free race next Saturday in Okpekpe near Auchi, Etsako East Local Government area of Edo state.   “While our ability to organise a world class event is not in doubt, this year’s race will be the biggest because World Athletics has raised the bar in terms of requirements to organise an elite label race,” he said.
