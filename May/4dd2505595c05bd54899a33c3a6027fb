FEYENOORD striker Cyriel Dessers has hinted he may stay at the Eredivisie club beyond this season. The Nigeria international has been playing for the Club of the People on loan from KRC Genk. He managed to score 10 goals en route to the Europa Conference League final, where they lost by a solitary goal to AS Roma, and managed to find the back of the net nine times and provided two assists in the Netherlands’ domestic league. Genk are asking for 4million Euros for Dessers which is quite a huge amount for Feyenoord.

They were also all a lot bigger. Chris Smalling has not become man of the match for anything. He especially made it very difficult for me [on Wednesday].”
