THE 28-year-old shares some of his heartache after their Afcon disappointment and failed bid to reach 2022 World Cup finals Nigeria defender William Troost-Ekong believes the Super Eagles will rise again after their recent setbacks in international assignments. The Super Eagles have endured a disappointing campaign in the last few months. First, they suffered disappointment at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon and later failed to clinch qualification for the 2022 World Cup finals in Qatar. In Cameroon, Augustine Eguavoen’s side failed to go past the Round of 16 despite winning all their group matches after losing 1-0 against Tunisia. The Super Eagles then turned their focus to the World Cup qualification playoffs where they came up against Ghana.

The 28-year-old Troost-Ekong, who features for relegated Watford in England, believes the team will come back stronger from the disappointments. “It has been a tough few months for all of us, it’s a big heartache we have to keep on moving,” Troost-Ekong told reporters as quoted by Completesports. “When you fall down you have to stand up again, this team has been down before and came back and I believe we will do it again.” Nigeria are currently in Dallas, USA, in readiness for their friendly matches against Mexico and Ecuador and Troost-Ekong believes the two fixtures will give the Super Eagles a good chance to refresh ahead of the 2023 Afcon qualifiers.
