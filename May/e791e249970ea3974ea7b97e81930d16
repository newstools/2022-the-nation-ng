Everton climbed out of the Premier League relegation places by holding on for a hard-fought victory over Leicester City at King Power Stadium. A stunning volley by Vitaliy Mykolenko and Mason Holgate’s header gave Frank Lampard’s side their third win in five games and ensured they remain in control of their destiny with four games to play. Mykolenko finished superbly from Alex Iwobi’s cross after six minutes but Patson Daka capitalised on Yerry Mina’s attempted header back to Jordan Pickford to draw Leicester level five minutes later. The unmarked Holgate was quickest to react after Kasper Schmeichel kept out Richarlison’s initial header from a corner to restore the Toffees’ lead after 30 minutes. Forced to chase another equaliser, Leicester dominated for large periods in the second half – but they found England number one Pickford once again in inspired form.

Everton moved up to 16th with victory, one point above Burnley and Leeds United, who lost 2-1 at Arsenal to drop to 18th. The Toffees have played one game fewer than their relegation rivals. Meanwhile, defeat extends Leicester’s winless Premier League run to five games and leaves Brendan Rodgers’ side 14th in the table. BBC
