FOLLOWING the release of her 2018 critically acclaimed film ‘Onidiri,’ Olubukola Bolarinde, is set for her solo art exhibition debut tagged ‘106 Expressions.’ According to Bolarinde, the CEO of Yellow Dot Limited, the exhibition will be an intimate display of Bolarinde’s artworks inspired by her experiences from childhood that traverse time and culture. “Expressions is a collection of artworks celebrating our African heritage; our people, and our culture. I have drawn inspiration from my experiences as an African child. The works transport you to a place and a time, perceived through an African child’s mind. A different time from the times we now live in. As our world continues to evolve, a great number of our children have not and will never have these experiences,” explained Bolarinde. Describing her art as a form of preservation, the self-taught artist and architect disclosed that each piece of artwork at the exhibition will tell a unique story.

A distinct fusion of the North and the South, which speaks to and holds true to my identity and diversity.” For the art exhibition, Bolarinde deployed various media such as acrylics and oils on canvas; the use of rich textures to create pieces that give an illusion of being tactile and three-dimensional and hopes to deliver an immersive experience for viewers. The exhibition is scheduled for June 10, 2022, in Lagos. The graduate of Bartlett School of Architecture, University College London, has naturally been drawn to art in all its forms of expression even as a passion at an early age.
