The Conference of Nigeria Political Parties (CNPP) has demanded that the Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, vacates office or be fired by President Muhammadu Buhari, in view of his open involvement in politics while still in office. The CNPP argued that by his actions, which included his purchase of the nomination and expression of interest forms of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and his suit to restrain the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), Emefiele had desecrated the office of CBN governor and was no longer fit to retain the office.
