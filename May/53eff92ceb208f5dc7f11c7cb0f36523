After several shifts in the deadline for subscribers to link their SIMs with their NINs, the Federal Government, had on April 4, directed operators, through the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), to bar over 72 million SIMs affected from making calls.

The process of linking NIN with SIM has been dogged by controversies, especially around accusations of extortion by agents contracted by NIMC to do the capturing. There is also the allegation of slow integration of subscriber information transmitted to NIMC server, thus delaying response time for linking SIMs with NINs. Subscribers told our correspondent that four weeks after getting their NINs, they remained painfully unbarred. Those who sought explanation were told to cough out between N3,000 and N4,000 to expedite the process of validation. “I was told I may remain bared for the next four months if I don’t pay N4,000 to get the validation done. It’s so very painful that weeks after I have obtained the NIN after paying N2,500, I have not been able to originate calls from my number and this is affecting my business terribly,” the single parent called Iya Philip lamented.
