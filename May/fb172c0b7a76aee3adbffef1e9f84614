It would also be the first intercontinental major cup final to be hosted in Godswill Akpabio International Stadium in Uyo.

The Cairo outfit confirmed on Tuesday in a press release that they had approached the world sport judicial body in Switzerland after an appeal to the Confederation of African Football (CAF) failed. Wydad Casablanca of Morocco are likely to play Ahly in the May 30 title decider and the Egyptians say it would be “unfair for one club to have home advantage”. “Al Ahly has presented an appeal to CAS against the decision of CAF not to organise the 2022 CAF Champions League 2022 in a neutral venue,” the release said. “The club has already asked CAF to play the match in a neutral venue and will appeal the CAF decision, asking CAS to resolve the situation before the final. “Al Ahly hopes CAF will be keen not to obstruct justice and that it will provide CAS with all the required documents that will help to obtain justice.”
