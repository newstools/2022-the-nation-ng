Handlers of the Super Eagles might be forced to alter the team’s list for the forthcoming international friendlies against Mexico and Ecuador with words rife that some of the players do not have entry visas into the United States. The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) had a fortnight ago released a 30-man list to prosecute the matches against the South American and North American teams. The AT&T Stadium in Texas will host the Mexico vs Nigeria duel on Saturday, May 28, and the New York Red Bulls will host the tie between Ecuador and Nigeria on Friday, June 3. The list without striker Victor Osimhen had Captain Ahmed Musa and his vice William Troost-Ekong are also in the squad amongst other regular suspects including goalkeeper Maduka Okoye who in the interim has pulled out.

It was equally gathered that the incoming Super Eagles coach Portuguese Jose Peseiro is expected to join the team in the US being his first contact with the team ahead of next month’s 2023 AFCON qualifier against Sierra Leone and Mauritius on June 9 and June 13 respectively. Meanwhile, Super Eagles assistant coach Salisu Yusuf is eagerly looking forward to the arrival of the Portuguese coach. “I’m always ready to learn new things and I think the arrival of the coach (Peseiro) will help the Super Eagles,” noted the Kano Pillars coach in an interview with a Lagos-based Sports Radio, Brila FM.
