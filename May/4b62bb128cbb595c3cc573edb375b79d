Stakeholders in the All Progressives Congress (APC) have reached a decision to zone the presidency to the south ahead of the 2023 general election, the Middle Belt Youths Forum (MBYF) has said. The youths urged the National Chairman of APC, Sen. Abdullahi Adamu to consult with President Muhammadu Buhari on the issue of zoning before making public statements on it. In a statement signed by its leader, Godwin Meliga, the group said the consultation with the president, as the leader of the party, was important because Adamu is new in the saddle and a decision had already been reached on the matter. Adamu on Friday said the party was yet to decide on which part of the country will get the party’s ticket ahead of the 2023 election.

Why is Adamu therefore talking from both sides of his mouth? “Our advice for the elder statesman is that he should be consulting widely before making public statements on matters like this.”
