The family of Abisola Williams is soliciting the help of Nigerians to raise over N1.2 million for their 16-year-old child, to undergo surgery. Abisola’s brother, Ayodele, said she was involved in an accident on May 4 at Iyana-Ajia Bus Stop, Egbeda, Ibadan, Oyo State. Ayodele said: “Abisola lives with our mother at Ibadan and on that fateful day, she was with my mum at Iyana-Ajia Bus stop, waiting for a bus. Suddenly, a car at high speed hit the people. The car had a break failure and two people died instantly. “Her thigh bones were broken. When they got to Emergency Centre at University College Hospital (UCH), they realised that she had another fracture in her neck. The scan and X-rays showed she would need to undergo neurosurgery and orthopaedic surgeries. We were told to get N1.2 million. The neurosurgery will cost N800,000 while the orthopaedic costs N400,000.
