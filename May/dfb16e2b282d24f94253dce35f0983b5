Chairman, Nathaniel Idowu Foundation, Yemi Idowu has described the revamped Cana Junior Sports Centre Ajegunle, formerly known as Maracana Stadium, as a promise fulfilled. Speaking exclusively with The Nation, the businessman and youth sports developer, said the sports facility is a dream come true and is in line with the focus of the Foundation, which, is ‘youth development through sports.’ The choice of Ajegunle, he added, is deliberate to cater to the sporting needs of school-age children in Ajeromi Ifelodun Local Government.   Counting cost of unending NBBF leadership crisis     My husband in pain, hallucinates, wife of ailing journalist…     WAFCON COUNTDOWN: Captain Ebi recalls fun-filled Falcons’…   “My current research reveals a long journey of which we are lucky to be part of it. Many years ago Governor Bola Ahmed Tinubu introduced the Millennium Schools concept and promised standard education to the children of Ajegunle.  This promise was fulfilled and today Ajeromi ifelodun local government has over 32 Millennium schools. For this reason, Ajegunle which is within Ajeromi Ifelofun local has a very high concentration of school-age children and is very important for school sports,” said Idowu. The sports facility upon completion, will, perhaps, be the biggest sporting arena for school-age children in Nigeria. Idowu added: “When completed, we will have 19 football pitches, three basketball courts, two tennis courts,  20 table tennis tables, a mixed martial arts gym, and a full fitness gym.  We will also have 5,000 seated grandstands, 50metres Olympic size swimming pool, a 25metres training pool, and a diving pool. There will also be hostels for up to 300 children, many changing rooms, toilets, a medical center, water, electricity, and 24-hour security service.” Cana Junior Sports Centre Ajegunle is up for testing this week and it is expected that junior players will light up the facility beginning today.
