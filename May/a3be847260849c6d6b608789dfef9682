Glasgow Rangers manager Giovanni van Bronckhorst praised Super Eagles midfielder Joe Aribo for his adaptability after the 25-year-old was tasked with playing a false nine role in the Europa League final with Alfredo Morelos injured and Kemar Roofe still easing back to fitness. Aribo was on target but Rangers lost 5-4 on penalties to Eintracht Frankfurt in the final of the UEFA Europa League on Wednesday night. After a goalless first half, Aribo put Rangers ahead in the 57th minute. And with a Scottish Cup final beckoning against Hearts on Saturday, the Rangers boss admits he had to adjust players like Aribo to new positions. He told BT Sport the Nigerian star did very well in the role: “I think he did very well, it’s a new role for him and we had to adjust our lineup because Morelos was out. “We had to adjust the players to adapt to a new position. I think he played really well today, he scored an important goal and in the end he was empty and we had to change him.”   2023 World Championships: Nigeria rules Western Region…     Fifth Chukker, Malcomines chase honours at Access Bank…     ‘Bazooka’ Bassey earns praises after Europa masterclass   Meanwhile, Aaron Ramsey has been backed to score a penalty if Wales’ World Cup play-off goes to spot-kicks.

But Ramsey is in a 27-man squad named by interim Dragons boss Robert Page for five matches in June – including the World Cup play-off final and four Nations League games. And Page says he would have no problem in Rambo stepping up again from 12 yards if the June 5 final against either Scotland or Ukraine ends up going the distance. Asked if he still had faith in Ramsey, Page replied: “Absolutely, 100 per cent. “It happens to the best in the world. It happened to Gareth (Bale) in the Euros. Top players, they put themselves up.
