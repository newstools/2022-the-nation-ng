It was an exciting moment for Comedian Bovi as he visited his Alma mata Delta State University Abraka The excited Comedian recalled he was almost expelled for allegedly assaulting someone. He stated it was humbling to be honoured by an institution he adores. The father of three shared a video surrounded by people during the visit to the school as he walked towards the female hostel, which he said he was never allowed to enter while on campus.   I’m not afraid of giving love another chance –…     ‘Stefflon the best woman Burna Boy will ever…     Actress Mercy Aigbe gives husband head cut   Blushing over the honour, he said: “So last month I had the rare privilege of being invited to my alma-mater (Delta State University ) by the Vice Chancellor, Prof. Andy Egwunyenga. A whole vice chancellor even supported kola for me (I faced disciplinary panel like 3 months after my final papers. So yeah I was almost expelled for alleged assault. So it was refreshing to be celebrated for once.) “I also got to meet with some of my former lecturers like Mr. Martins, Mr. Green and Mr. Boniface. And then I met students of my department, theatre arts! These guys are stars in the making. I can see it. Their fire is evident; more than the fire I had. “Finally I went to girls hostel! Girls hostel wey dem no dey let us enter, I enter with my full chest But the beautiful thing was that a lady gave me her baby to pray for her! I simply prayed that her baby will be great and I dedicated the baby to God. ” Yes I am Mufasa like that! ! I sha entered girls hostel! Still can’t get over that fact. Long live Delta State University, ABRAKA!!!!!! #throwbackthursday.”
