Victor Osimhen is increasingly likely to remain at Napoli, as nobody is prepared to meet the €110m asking price, while the club denies asking Kalidou Koulibaly to halve his salary. La Gazzetta dello Sport claim that the Partenopei would be prepared to let Nigeria international hitman Osimhen go this summer, but not for less than €110m. Although there is interest from the likes of Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester United and Newcastle United, none of the Premier League sides are ready to hit those figures.

Meanwhile, Napoli released a formal statement this afternoon to deny reports in the Corriere dello Sport claiming that they had offered Koulibaly a contract extension at half his current salary, which is €6m per season. If that was the proposal on the table, it would be effectively pushing the Senegal international centre-back towards a transfer.
