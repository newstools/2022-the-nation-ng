The Moroccan side has two CAFCL titles to their name and has been one of the most consistent performers in this competition in recent seasons, reaching the semifinals or better in six of the last seven editions of the competition. They also have a controversial home advantage for this one-off final, with Casablanca the only city which submitted a complete bid to the Confederation of African Football to host the match – much to the anger and frustration of Al Ahly. Nonetheless, Al Ahly coach Pitso Mosimane has backed his team to shrug off the venue controversy, mounting injuries and a packed schedule to claim CAFCL glory.
