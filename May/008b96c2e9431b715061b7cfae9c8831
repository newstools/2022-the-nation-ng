The Primate and President of the African Church, His Eminence, Dr. Emmanuel Udofia, has urged Nigerians to pray that a man after God’s heart will emerge as the next president. He spoke yesterday as the church began its 4th biennial conference at the African Church, Ebenezer Cathedral, Ibadan, Oyo State. Dr. Udofia, who addressed reporters, said: As the 2023 general election is fast approaching, I advise Nigerians to shun religious discrimination and ethnicity in electing leaders. I advise them to pray for good leaders. “Political arrangements, permutations, alignments and re-alignments are in top gear towards the elections. I implore political actors and gladiators to play their games according to the rules, being mindful of the fact that politics is not a do or die affair.

Let’s open our eyes wide this time. “African Church remains one of the earliest indigenous churches in Nigeria, founded on October 13, 1901 to enable Africans spread the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ and worship God in spirit and in truth without any racial interference.” He said the theme of the conference: “Redeeming the time”, was to reawake everyone on the critical time the entire world was going through.
