The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) has said that ongoing investigation of a suspected drug baron, (name withheld) has led to the discovery of more than N22billion worth of tramadol. This is contained in a statement by NDLEA Director Media and Advocacy, Mr Femi Babafemi, on Tuesday in Abuja. Babafemi said that the investigation led to how the suspect in October 2019 imported into Nigeria two containers, containing 1,284 cartons of Tramadol with market value of over N22billion. He said that the statement was to counter insinuations by some hirelings that NDLEA had no evidence to pin a crime on the suspect, widely believed to be the chair of a group ofm firms. According to him, after months of surveillance, the suspect was eventually arrested on board a flight to Abuja at the MM2 Terminal of the Lagos airport, Ikeja, on Wednesday, April 13.
