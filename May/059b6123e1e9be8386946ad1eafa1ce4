An entrepreneur, Theoder Okechukwu has announced the launch of a cryptocurrency wallet ‘Paychatik’ and ‘Inflowchange’ to alleviate the problems of swapping and transaction costs. Okechukwu, a business management student at Krok University in Kyiv, Ukraine, said the conflict in Ukraine will not deter him from attaining his aim. According to him, the soon-to-be-released invention will address the issues of bitcoin swapping and transaction expenses. Paychatik, he said, allows users to check users before giving out payment.

Free swapping, know verified wallet before you send, and the ability to chat and pay. There will also be very low sending fees. “On Paychatik wallet, you will be able to chat before you pay, and you can know if the user for the address you want to send payment is verified or not,” he said. Okechukwu also detailed how Inflowchange will eliminate delays in the bitcoin to fiat conversion procedure. “I want to make exchange as fast as possible and so when a user wants to sell his cryptocurrency on Inflowchange, and you send out your crypto to generated address or QR CODE, when payment is confirmed on the blockchain network, payout will be automatically issued to your wallet and will be processed to your bank account. It is easy with no delays,” he added. Okechukwu, a native of Ihitteaforukwu Ahiazu Mbaise in Imo State, said he intends to start a bank to address problems in the Nigerian banking system.
