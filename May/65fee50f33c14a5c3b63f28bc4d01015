Farmers from communities across five local government areas of Kaduna State on Saturday protested incessant killings and kidnap of their members as well as their inability to access their farmlands due to activities of bandits terrorising the state. The farmers, however, vowed that if the security challenges persist in the areas without a solution, they may be forced to take arms against their attackers. The farmers, whose groups cut across Kajuru, Mararaban Rido, Kachia, Kargoro, Kawo and Zaria, spoke through a statement by their chairman, Ibrahim Mustapha, that bandits have caged them and prevented them from going to their farms. The statement came after the farmers had spent eight days at home without access to their farm due to insecurity.

Some have been killed, while those who managed to pay the ransom have remained in abject poverty till now,” he said. The farmers’ leader ultimately pleaded with security agencies in the state to intensify efforts at combating criminal activities of the bandits terrorising the state.
