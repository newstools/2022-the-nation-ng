Don’t let their laughter Hide the dagger of the slaughter They have already shown the skill And they know how to kill   They derided the sun In their nightward run They put all their cats in the house Without a single mouse   Far, far, still far away That blessed appointed day When the world will sit together Like birds of a willing feather     SNAPSONG 156     WHEN TWILIGHT CAME TO THE TYRANT (2)     WHEN TWILIGHT CAME TO THE TYRANT (1)   But can the birds ever fly No matter how much they try What winds will move their beak In their desperate bid to speak   Mysterious life, sweet and sour Bright one moment, dark another hour So, bust that blue and drift into dance Never wait for another chance   Of all the treats in my busy kitchen None so ambitious as my pretty chicken With luck and little spice It will sit supreme on my mountain of rice
