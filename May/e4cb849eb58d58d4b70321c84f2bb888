Manchester United are reportedly ‘in pole position’ to sign Napoli striker Victor Osimhen. United’s manager Erik ten Hag is set to embark on his first transfer window in charge of the Red Devils and he could be handed a welcome gift in the shape of the Nigeria international. The Dutchman has revealed to the Manchester United board that he wishes to sign a new striker ‘at all costs’ this summer, despite having Cristiano Ronaldo in his ranks, with both Edinson Cavani and Anthony Martial expected to depart Old Trafford in the next few months. And the Red Devils have been one of a number of clubs who have expressed their interest in highly-rated Osimhen, who has scored 18 goals in 31 appearances in all competitions this season.

Napoli value the forward at around £85million (€100m), an asking price that has not put off United so far. The report says they have long held an interest in the 23-year-old and there is a strong possibility this Sunday’s match at Spezia will be his last for the Serie A side. United are expected to sign a number of players this summer as part of ten Hag’s rebuild and following reports that the Red Devils are already interested in signing Jurrien Timber and Antony, they have now added a third player to their transfer list.
