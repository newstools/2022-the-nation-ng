Manchester United’s season ended with a whimper as they were beaten at Crystal Palace in front of new manager Erik ten Hag. Former United winger Wilfried Zaha scored the winning goal in the first half, latching onto a through ball and turning Diogo Dalot before drilling a low finish into the corner. Despite the loss, United finish a disappointing campaign in sixth place to clinch a Europa League spot – as West Ham were beaten by Brighton – while Palace end in a respectable 12th place.

The Dutchman is taking over a team from Ralf Rangnick which is bereft of sort any leadership or confidence. The departing Edinson Cavani had a snapshot clawed out by Vicente Guaita and the Spanish keeper also brilliantly tipped over United midfielder Hannibal Mejbri’s first-time effort from the edge of the box. Zaha and Jeffrey Schlupp both had low shots kept out by David de Gea but United’s number one could do nothing about Zaha’s 37th minute goal, which nestled into the bottom corner. BBC
