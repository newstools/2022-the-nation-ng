The ex-wife of Don jazzy, Michelle Jackson has relieved a terrible encounter on her day in Lagos Nigeria’s commercial capital. Michelle, who was in Nigeria to cool off, said the encounter was between a policeman and gentleman driver. Relieving what she experienced, she wrote: “I’m still quite terrified. There were some police on the road and from what I understand the police should not have been on the road in that capacity because that’s not what they are supposed to be doing. “But anyway, there was a guy in a really nice car and the police had tried to stop the guy in his car and the car zoomed off, almost literally running over this policeman.

We literally docked our heads and the guy just sped off. “There were lots of police and they will come to the window but we had security and when they saw their colleagues they just sort of left us alone and we were allowed to go. “Nigerian is a whole vibe, It’s so different to what I’ve been used to. Nigeria is such a beautiful country the people and all, but I witnessed something today that i will never want to witness again. I was scared. What would have happened if we weren’t travelling with our security? What would that look like?” Attachments area
