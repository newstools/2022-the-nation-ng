Managing Director, Unity Bank Plc, Mrs. Tomi Somefun, said the bank’s key performance indicators have continued on a trajectory of healthy balance sheet growth, asset quality and profitability achieved on the back of deft diversification of the bank’s earnings base. She noted that the bank’s strategy balances out fairly in asset creation, investments and trade activities while riding on innovative customer-centric product offerings for both the retail and consumer segments of the market. According to her, given the increased focus of the bank on growing its retail footprints supported by significant investment being made in technology to expand its digital banking space, the growing contribution of the channels and platforms delivery will further boost the multiple streams of income in the coming years. “The bank’s growing profile in agribusiness has now placed it on a pedestal that enables it to attract significant value chain businesses for the continuous growth of its retail and small and medium enterprise (SME) banking whilst the bank consistently deploys product development and marketing initiatives to further grow the brand franchise, maximise the benefits and boost retail growth to double digits,” Somefun said. She expressed optimism that positive sentiments around the repositioning of the bank and the outcome will continue to dominate opinion among analysts as market confidence continues to improve.
