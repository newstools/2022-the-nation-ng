The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) said that its operatives laid siege to the residence of former Imo Governor Senator Rochas Okorocha because of his refusal to honour the commission’s invitations. It said Okorocha jumped administrative bail granted him by EFCC. It also alleged that attempts to arraign Senator Okorocha were stalled twice owing to the absence of the ex-Governor who reportedly evaded service of processes. The EFCC made the clarifications in a statement by its Head of Media and Publicity, Mr. Wilson Uwujaren. The statement reads: “Operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), today May 24, 2022, arrived at the Maitama, Abuja home of a former Governor of Imo state, Senator Rochas Okorocha, to effect his arrest.
