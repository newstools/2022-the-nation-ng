Nigeria international Cyriel Dessers has expressed his desire to continue at Feyenoord beyond the summer amidst an expected rise in interest in his services from clubs abroad in the coming weeks. Dessers has been the nightmare of many defenders and goalkeepers on the continent this season after an excellent goal scoring run for Feyenoord in the Europa Conference League. The one-cap Super Eagles striker has smashed in ten goals to leave Feyenoord a draw away from reaching the final of the new continental competition.

Feyenoord have the first refusal on the Nigeria international, but the Rotterdammers are yet to exercise their purchase option on Dessers, who is on loan from Belgian side Racing Genk. “If you score goals at the European level, it makes sense,” Dessers told ESPN, as per De Morgen. “On the other hand, I think I’m in the right place here. It’s a dream of mine to play for such a big club and do well there. I think everyone can see from me that I am happy and enjoying myself here.”
