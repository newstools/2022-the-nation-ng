Rose was in charge for 47 games, winning 27 and losing 16. “This day is not an easy one for any of us, because the mutual respect among each other was, is and remains great,” said Dortmund chief executive Hans-Joachim Watzke. “After a season that was unsatisfactory for various reasons, we had to realise that we didn’t get the most out of our opportunities in many areas.”
