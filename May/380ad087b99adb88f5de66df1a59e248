Let us close ranks and find a new roadmap for the APC which has long been in the opposition. I pray the indulgence of all in this contest to sheath their swords so that we would bring glory to the party.” He described himself as a “team player”, promising to reach out to every one of his co-contestants individually. Bwacha described Taraba as being at the precipice and that “what we need to do is to work together to redefine governance and bring it closer to the people and then redefine the dignity of the Civil service which has fallen to its lowest ebb”.
