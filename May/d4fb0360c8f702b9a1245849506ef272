The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has accused the Presidency of allowing mass looting of public funds to corruptly create a war chest for the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to intimidate Nigerians and muscle the 2023 general election. The PDP said public funds meant for development purposes and salaries of workers were being diverted to APC coffers through exorbitant nomination fees. In a statement yesterday by the spokesman for the PDP, Debo Ologunagba, the party alleged that the proceeds from sale of APC forms were being warehoused for the 2023 general election.   CNPP demands sack of CBN Governor Emefiele     Sanwo-Olu: power should shift to South     UNILORIN students to Fed Govt: resolve ASUU issues or no…   The statement said: “Our party has information of how public funds are being withdrawn from Ministries, Agencies and Parastatals of government and diverted to people who have no verifiable means of livelihood to purchase APC’s presidential nomination and expression of interest forms for individuals without any electoral value and who cannot even win local government elections. “We have intelligence on how public funds are pulled out of government agencies in a surreptitious design perfected by an APC leader in connivance with certain individuals in positions of authority close to top persons in the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). “Nigerians will recall that the PDP had earlier alerted on how the CBN under Mr. Godwin Emefiele as CBN governor has been turned into the finance department of the APC where APC leaders fraudulently access public funds through nebulous subsidies, shady intervention programmes and discriminatory exchange policies, which perpetuate illegal arbitrage system.”
