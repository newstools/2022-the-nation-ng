A a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim has supported President Muhammadu Buhari for referring the new Electoral Act amendment bill for due diligence. In a statement by his media office in Abuja, Olawepo-Hasim, who withdrew from the presidential race, noted Buhari is right to refer the new Bill for due diligence before giving his assent. According to him: “People have been churning out different versions of the act as if laws are primary school instructions of a village headmaster. “We must put a stop to this and do things properly and be fair to the President and don’t ridicule his office by bringing things not properly digested for him to sign.”   Ekiti 2022: PDP fumes as Fayose’s ally, others join…     PDP suspends primaries indefinitely in Imo     APC clarifies membership of governorship aspirants in…   He explained the “issue is about political interest of different factions of the political elite working in cahoot with INEC. They want to present Nigerians with a fait accompli through the ongoing primaries of the two major political parties. The President can see through this.” Olawepo-Hashim maintained further that “the solution as I have argued is simple. Let primaries hold between now and August when the executive leadership ,the legislative leadership, INEC,and the party leadership would have made input into an acceptable electoral act then president can sign.” The Electoral Act, he argued, provides that primaries shoul hold 180 days to election and 180 days is August. “So, why the stampede? There must be transparency and fairness to all sides ,no one should ambush any one.I have been saying this since March,” he said. .
