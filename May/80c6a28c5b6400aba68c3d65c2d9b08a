It dissociated itself from the position of some of its Concerned Members of its Senate who rejected Prof. Oladiji’s appointment. A statement by Chairman of ASUU-FUTA, Prof. Oluyinka Awopetu, said the union was yet to meet to discuss issues relating to the new VC’s appointment. Prof. Awopetu said the statement rejecting appointment of Prof Olajidi never originated from ASUU-FUTA Secretariat.
