The Federal Government (FG) has began looking to future minerals like Lithium, Cobalt, Nickel, Copper and a lot more. The government hopes the minerals that are used in the production of aircraft, cars and other things will eventually replace the country’s over dependence on oil as other nations move towards the use of electric cars. Director General (DG) Nigeria Mining Cadastre Office (NMCO), Engr Obadiah Nkom disclosed this at an interactive session with journalists in Abuja.

Nkomo disclosed that the government has identified some minerals that the country will need especially in its quest for steel production and blocked its access to mining to avoid it being exhausted when the country needs it. He said, “The Mining Cadastral Office (MCO) has moved away from just issuing licences, we now look at market analysis  and minerals. We are now looking into future minerals as a policy matter, our research department has started looking into minerals to start concentrating on. Some of them are the battery minerals the Lithium, Cobalt, copper etc because countries are beginning to eradicate the use of fuel in cars and going electric. “When you go outside this country and talk of some minerals, people will simply look at you but when you talk of minerals like Lithium, Cobalt, Nickel, Copper etc they are interested in knowing if you have it in your country because they are the future minerals and anybody that wants to invest looking at the future, these are the minerals being used in aircraft production, electric cars etc because we will soon get to the stage where all cars are electrical, the law is already being enacted in some countries and this country hopes to one day get to that.”
