The Imo State government has reacted to the judgement of the Supreme Court on the disputed oil wells with Rivers State, urging citizens of the state to remain calm. The State Attorney General, Barr C.O.C Akaolisa, told The Nation in Owerri on Saturday  that  he was surprised at the statement by Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike, claiming victory and embarking on celebration even before the judgement. He said the action of the governor suggested that he might have had a pre-knowledge of the judgement hence the celebration. “Uptill now, we have not received a copy of the judgement and do not know  the areas that the judgment favours them and the area we are favoured,” he said. The Supreme Court on Friday, had resolved the ownership dispute in 17 oil wells in favour of the Rivers State government.   2023: PDP doesn’t have good aspirants – Amaechi     2023: Battle of the titans for Senate seats in Imo     2023: Familiar faces square off in contest for Abia Senate…   In a judgement prepared by Justice Ellen Ogunwumiju but delivered by Justice Emmanuel Agim, the apex court dismissed the counter claim ownership put forward by the Imo State government. According to Justice Agim, reliefs One, Three, Four, Five, and Six sought by the Rivers State government were granted by the court. The court, however, refused to grant reliefs Two, Seven, and 10. Akaolisa noted that the Counsel to the Government, Chief Olusola Oke, informed him that the Supreme Court granted a part of the claim of Rivers State while it refused another part. He said since both parts had not been made known to the government, it is premature to speculate on the outcome of the judgement. He urged Imo people to remain calm and law abiding until the government is apprised of the true state of the judgement.
