It  granted AMCON the right to seize any landed property in any other place that may be found within the jurisdiction of the Federal High Court belonging to Aeroland Travels  or either of its directors. AMCON spokesperson, Jude Nwauzor confirmed that  the property listed in the court order had been taken over by AMCON with the assistance of bailiffs. AMCON had purchased the Non-Performing Loan (NPL) of Aeroland Travels from Polaris Bank (formerly Skye Bank) in 2018. Until the order, efforts by AMCON and its representatives to resolve the debt amicably with the obligor had proved abortive.
