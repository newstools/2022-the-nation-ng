The Association of Nigerian Licensed Customs Agents (ANLCA) has described as insensitive  the 15 per cent National Automotive Council (NAC) levy placed on imported used vehicles by the government. The association argued that the levy was meant for new imported vehicles, but the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) extended the tax to tokunbo (used) vehicles. ANLCA had announced a warning strike as talks with stakeholders failed to compel NCS from withdrawing the policy, but the industrial action was called off.

Farinto stated that decisions on the elimination of the 15 per cent levy was a collaboration between the government and the motor dealers association. “The 15 per cent National Automotive Council levy would be pursued immediately after the Sallah break. I am assuring you that the leadership would engage the national assembly on the insensitivity of the government to the plight of the masses to have introduced the levy at this period when the economy is comatose. “We will also ensure that the Federal Ministry of Finance is dragged before the people’s representatives on this matter,” Farinto said, adding: “Since the CRFFN Governing Council may also be inaugurated this week, it will be our first issue to be raised at the plenary, which needs urgent national attention.’’
