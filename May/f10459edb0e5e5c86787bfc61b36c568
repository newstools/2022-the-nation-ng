Ahead of the primaries of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Bayelsa State, the Chairman of Ogbia Local Government Area, Ebinyo Turner, has allegedly been dishing out employment letters delegates to attract their votes. It was learnt that Turner, who is also an aspirant for the Ogbia Federal Constituency ticket of the party, had allegedly issued out over 50 of such employment letters to the delegates. It was also gathered that most of the beneficiaries of the employment rackets had received their first monthly salaries from the council to further hoodwink them to vote for the chairman. A staff member of the council, who confirmed the development in confidence, expressed concern that the new and strange offer of employment would negatively affect the finances of the LGA.

The source said: “We told the chairman not to do it but he refused. We are all peeved by his actions. He is allowing politics to becloud his sense of reasoning.

The PDP leader, who did not want to be mentioned, said the chairman’s action had increased the wage bill of the council and added to its financial burden. He said the action of the chairman had made mess of the reforms of the state government to sanitise the local government system.
