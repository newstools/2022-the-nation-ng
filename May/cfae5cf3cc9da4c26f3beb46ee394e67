The Peoples Democratic Party in Imo State suspended its primaries for the House of Assembly and House of Representatives indefinitely, over unreconciled delegates lists and what it considers as confusion created by the 2022 Electoral Act. Legal Advisor of the party in the state, Kessinger Ikeokwu,  said that Imo  would not vote along with other states that are using their three-man and one-man national delegates. He said: “Please note that the reason for the suspension of the PDP House of Assembly and House of Representatives primaries in Imo State as a result of the confusion that arose from the error of the National Assembly in the country.   Elumelu, Abia Speaker win primaries     Peaceful, consensus primaries in Jigawa     Delay trails primaries in Plateau   “This is hinged on Section 84 of the Electoral Act, which inadvertently led to the exclusion of over 80 per cent of delegates ordinarily meant to vote at the primaries. “The Imo PDP  case was compounded because it hadn’t tidied up its three-man ad hoc delegates, who ought to vote at the primaries, due to pending litigations. “Every preparation was made for us to use our statutory delegates to vote, before the National Assembly saw the error in Section 84 of the Amended Electoral Act, 2022, which excluded the statutory delegates.”
