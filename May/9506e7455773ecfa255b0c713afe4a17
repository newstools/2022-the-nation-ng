One of the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship aspirant in Benue, Mr Terwase Orbunde, has urged members of the party to turn out enmasse and participate in the direct primaries exercise on Thursday. This is contained in a statement he signed and issued to newsmen on Monday in Makurdi. Orbunde called on his supporters in the 276 wards in the state to come out and vote for him at the governorship primaries. He stated that he supported the decision of the party to conduct direct primaries because it would give every member the opportunity to participate directly in the choice of candidates for the various elective offices. He called on the leadership of the party to ensure that the process is transparent, free and fair and allow members free hands to participate in the exercise.

He urged them to consider the cognate experience he had acquired through the various offices he held at the local government, state and national levels and give him the party’s governorship flag to fly. He said that he had built a massive support base across the political divide throughout the state over the years that was eager to vote for the APC as an expression of support for his candidature. He stressed that the turning point at the 2023 general elections would be the support and vote of people across party lines as well as those who were not partisan politicians. He said that he had the capacity to mobilise such people to vote for the party. (NAN)
