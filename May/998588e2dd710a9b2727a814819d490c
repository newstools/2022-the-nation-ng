It was Umeh who ensured that the host claimed the doubles titles on the first day of the competition with a 3-0 win over Kanate. Kizito however, fired a warning to other competitors in the singles event as the Paris-based Ivorian believed his return to Lagos would bring him good tiding. “It was not easy losing my title in 2021, but this year, I am fully ready to reclaim my title and what I played in the team event was just a tip of the iceberg of what to expect from me in Lagos. There is no doubt that the journey to the top would not be easy but I am ready to work through it and reclaim the title I surrendered at the same venue last year,” Kizito said.
