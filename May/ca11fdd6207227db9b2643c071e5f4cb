Scarcity of petrol has hit Akure and environs over the leadership crisis rocking the Ore Unit of the Petroleum Tanker Drivers (PTD). Price of fuel remained at N165 per litre at many filling stations but those dispensing fuel had long queues. Many stations which had no fuel said they could not get any supply. It was gathered that the scarcity followed the refusal of the Warri Zonal leadership of PTD to allow tankers from Ore Unit load products for sealing up the Ore Unit office. But the aggrieved members of the Ore PTD said the crisis was as a result of refusal of its current leadership to leave office after spending eight years. They said the exco refused to conduct elections for new leadership to emerge.

He said: “There are people who have been leading us in the last eight years and they don’t want to leave office. We agreed that the zonal leaders will come from Warri on April 29 and address us. We were still waiting for them when the same people were sworn in as caretaker members on April 21 by the zonal leadership. “Since then we have closed down this office and we are saying that unless election is conducted, we will not allow them to go into this office. They have spent eight years, some of them in the executive have spent 16 years. Just 10 of them cannot hold over 100 of us to ransom. “Our tankers are not allowed to get to Ore, especially if your waybill carries Ore. We tried using Ekiti waybill but now they have started stopping Ekiti too. People should help us beg the former lawmaker to leave this association matters alone. They have stopped tankers from bringing fuel to Ondo and Ekiti states…”
