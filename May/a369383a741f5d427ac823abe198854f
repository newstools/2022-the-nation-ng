The Vice-Chairman, FAMFA Oil Limited, Apostle Folorunso Alakija, has stated that the reforms in the oil and gas sector are expected to revitalise the economy. Alakija, who made this known  on a television programme monitored in Lagos, noted that as part of the structural adjustments to ramp up oil production, the government has introduced reforms such as the marginal field rounds, the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) and the transformation of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) into a limited liability company.

She argued that once operations fully commenced at the Dangote Petroleum Refinery, it would bring a positive change to the regime of subsidy and refining such that the country would not have to import as much as it currently does. Alakija urged the country to also focus on its mining sector because of its huge potential. “Our mining is an area that we need to pay more attention to. I think the area and others have all suffered because we have relied solely on oil over the years,” she added.
