In a brief chat, Oloketuyi explained that the biopic is dear to him because it is an answer to the need to keep Nigeria’s political history alive. “Many of the people that are relevant to our political history as a nation are being forgotten, and no one is going to help us remember them. This is my bit to ensure that it doesn’t happen. Adedibu made too much of an impact to allow memories of his time to be forgotten.” The film is billed for release in July 2022.
