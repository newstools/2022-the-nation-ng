Actress Yvonne Jegede has relived an attempted robbery attack she escaped from while driving in Lagos. The actress said that an unidentified man wanted to take advantage of her being alone to attempt an attack. She thanked her stars the traffic moved as the man planned to launch the attack, a situation she took advantage of to wade him off. She tweeted: “Last night about 9pm, one guy almost robbed me on the 3rd MB. I was lucky the traffic moved a bit so I moved my car and then he took off.

The guy jumped out from under the bridge. They target people driving alone. Be safe guys.” She warned of the dangers of driving alone in traffic. Jegede added: “If you are driving alone in traffic, don’t drive on the fast lane (the last lane by your left), let your car be in between cars. “Ladies especially, if you can, please stay wherever you are till you see daylight.
