Elon Musk, the billionaire founder of Tesla Inc., says Twitter may charge a “slight” fee for commercial and government users. Musk made this known in a post on his official Twitter handle. He, however, said the microblogging platform would be free for “casual users”. “Twitter will always be free for casual users, but maybe a slight cost for commercial/government users,” Musk said in a tweet on Wednesday. Last week, Twitter announced that it accepted Musk’s buyout offer of $44 billion, making him the new owner of the platform, pending regulatory and shareholder approval. Following the buyout announcement, Musk said he wanted to enhance the platform with new features.   ‘How to make airports viable’     MTN votes N300m for Media Innovation     Disquiet in Ado-Ekiti Fed Poly over ‘harsh’…   “Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,” he had said. “I also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spambots, and authenticating all humans.” On Monday, at the Met Gala – his first major public appearance since the deal was agreed – he was asked about his plans for Twitter. “My goal, assuming everything gets done, is to make Twitter as inclusive as possible and to have as broad a swathe of people on Twitter as possible,” he said. His latest announcement could be one of the changes he introduces after he completes his takeover of the social media platform.
