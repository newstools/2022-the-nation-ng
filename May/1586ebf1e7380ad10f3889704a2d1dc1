Staff and residents of Federal Government Girls College, Bwari on Friday took to the street to protest exorbitant estimated electricity bill. The protesters, who hit the street in protest the moment Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) officials came to disconnect their light, insisted that the officials should also remove their meter which they alleged was an industrial meter. They described the exorbitant estimated tariffs they are forced to pay monthly by the AEDC as ‘criminal and injustice’ while demanding that prepaid meters be made available to them immediately. Speaking on behalf of the protesting staff and residents, the Union Chairman of Federal Government Girls College, Bwari, Ajiloye Samuel, lamented that despite the fact that each of the residents are forced to pay 6,000-7,000 naira monthly which amounts to 300,000 in total; the AEDC still insists they have an outstanding bill of 5 million naira.

According to him, “We are agitating for the light bill which the AEDC is giving us the residents and staff; the bill is too much for us and we are saying that we cannot pay the bills again because its too high. “They’re giving us industrial bills from an industrial meter whereas we are not manufacturing anything in school. We are all residents like any other customer in the town… “From 2019, we have been servicing industrial meter and each year we pay 6000 naira and at the end, they’ll be bringing bill of 700,000-800,000 naira for about 52 houses. This is after all of us have paid 6000 naira amounting to over 300,000 and our bill is accumulating.
