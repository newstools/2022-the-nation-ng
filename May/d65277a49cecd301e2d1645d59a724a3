A newspaper columnist and former aide to Ebonyi State government, Monday Eze, has alleged abduction attempt on him by persons suspected to be agents of the state. Eze, in a post on his Facebook page, appealed to the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Alkali, ‘to use his good offices to protect him’. He also alleged in a brief statement to The Nation that he suspected that the attempt to abduct him might be in furtherance of a directive by a top government official that he  be prosecuted. The former aide said although the official did not give reason for the ‘prosecution  directive’, he said he was sure the order was because of a column where he accused the state of being behind the continued detention of a Catholic cleric, Rev.  Timothy Ngwuta, Eze, who authors Hammer and Anvil in The Telegraph, said those who tried to abduct him were operatives of the state.

The post reads: “Four men dressed in black tried to forcefully open my car and abduct me last night. It was on Abakaliki-Enugu Expressway, near FETHA 2 main gate. I had a companion in the car. We outsmarted the criminals by locking our car doors and swiftly crossing them. ‘’The men jumped on two motorcycles and pursued us, overtook us at the foot of Presco overhead bridge but were forced by vehicle traffic to climb up the overhead bridge in anticipation that we were coming up too. “God saved me through a quick and near-fatal veer at the foot of the bridge followed by a speedy disappearance into town through one of the many link roads at the Presco roundabout. “As I thank God for saving my life, I want the world to know that the my life is in danger. I plead with the inspector-general of Police to use his good offices to protect me. I am still in shock.”
