The N15 billion Series II offer under the Stanbic IBTC Infrastructure Fund N100 billion Shelf Programme is expected to bridge infrastructure gap in the country, the Stanbic IBTC Asset Management Limited has announced. Stanbic IBTC Asset Management Limited, a subsidiary of Stanbic IBTC Holdings PLC, said the Fund was designed to bridge the gap between the long-term funding needs of promoters of infrastructure projects and the needs of investors with long-term capital. The Fund, which is structured as a close-ended collective investment scheme, seeks to provide competitive returns above the benchmark of the Federal Government’s 10-year- bond yield. The Fund Manager closed its Series I offer in September 2021 and raised N6.745 billion across diverse investors, including Pension Fund Administrators, Asset Management Companies, Insurance Companies, and High Net-worth Individuals. The proceeds of the Series I offer were deployed in the energy and healthcare sectors.
