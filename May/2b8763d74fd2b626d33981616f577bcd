CHAIRMAN House of Representatives Committee on Aviation, Hon. Nnolim Nnaji has said that the lower legislative chamber will audit foreign airlines operating in the country to ascertain the number of Nigerians they employed as part of their cabin staff and technical crew. Nnaji who disclosed this in a statement in Abuja said the parliament would also be interested in finding out the percentage of their tickets that are sold by local travel agents and at what commission Nnaji stated that the audit would be done through the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority,  (NCAA) to ensure that Nigeria is not shortchanged in any way.

The House of Representatives Committee Chairman on Aviation emphatically stated that if it was found out that the foreign airlines were not engaging Nigerians as part of their technical and cabin crew, the committee would seek to correct it so that young Nigerian professionals could be employed.
