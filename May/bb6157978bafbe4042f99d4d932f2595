The Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) has enlisted the support of the Nigeria Police to curb extortion and other  illegalities on the Apapa and TinCan Island Port Complex (LPC)  Lagos’ access roads. This, NPA said, was vital to the implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between it and the Lagos State Government on truck traffic control and enforcement in Apapa and environs. Speaking while receiving the AIG Zone 2 Command Bode Adeyinka Adeleke, and his counterpart in the Maritime Police Command, Ibrahim Kaoje, the Managing Director of NPA, Mr Mohammed Bello Koko, lamented the number of  checkpoints along the ports corridor and got the consent of the AIG to join the NPA management on a spot check of the port’s access road.
