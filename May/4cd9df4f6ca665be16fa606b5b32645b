Former BBNaija ‘Shine Ya Eye’ housemate Angel Smith has stated what she’ll have to be subjected to before ever proposing to a man. The 22-year-old, who once described herself as fun and somewhat of a drama queen, said she’d consider licking up all the mud at Mile before thinking of proposing to a man. Angel made this known while reacting to a video of a popular on-air personality, Erhun Osariyekemwen Omorodion who publicly proposed to her boyfriend. The excited Omorodion, who got a ‘yes’ after she proposed marriage to her boyfriend, took to her social media page to share a video of the moment she proposed to her lover in a public shopping mall.

Reacting to the video, a food blogger, Sisi Yemmie asked her followers if they could propose to a man. Responding, Angel Smith declared she’d first lick all the mud at Mile 12 before daring to propose to a man. “I’d first lick all the mud in mile 12 before I do this,” she wrote.
