Analysts at Cordros Securities said they expected a moderation in price rally as investors seek to lock in profit from the five-week bullish run in the market. “Thus, we see more of a “choppy theme” as cautious trading takes center stage ahead of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting scheduled later in the month. Notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings,” Cordros Securities stated in a weekend note to investors.

In the report titled “FSDH Top Pick”, analysts said they remained bullish on upstream oil and gas companies and oil palm companies, following Indonesia’s decision to ban exports of palm olein which is expected to trigger a surge in CPO prices. “Clearly the trend of activities in the equities market has changed as domestic institutional investors are now taking bigger bets on Nigerian equities following expectations of prolonged bearish sentiments in the bonds market. “This narrative will likely continue for an extended period as bond yields are projected to continue the uptrend which would cause institutional investors to raise allocations to equities, particularly as new funds flow into the market. However, we advise investors to exercise patience and wait for the recent rally to cool off before taking positions in the market, as the market is over-stretched in the short term,” FSDH stated. The report selected 10 stocks which could yield above-average returns for investors. These included Unilever Nigeria, Lafarge Africa, Nigerian Breweries, International Breweries, Seplat Energies, Flour Mills of Nigeria, Transnational Corporation of Nigeria, Ecobank Transnational Incorporated, MTN Nigeria Communications and Okomu Oil Palm. The report noted that Nigerian equities market had extended its stellar 2022 performance into April as investors were in upbeat mood, aggressively taking positions in the equities market particularly with a focus on consumer goods names as well as oil palm companies. According to the report, the improved sentiments was first kicked off by dividend reinvesting activities by investors but was further spurred on by the outstanding first quarter 2022 earnings season. The report outlined that impressive outings from companies like Okomu, Guinness Nigeria, Nigerian Breweries, Unilever Nigeria and Lafarge Africa among others triggered a buying spree as investors’ interest notched a new level. Overall, the benchmark All Share Index (ASI) gained 5.7 per cent in April to close the month at 49,638.94 points. The rally in the Nigerian equities market was broad based as all major sectors closed higher. The rally was led by the oil and gas sector with average gain of 19.1 per cent in April 2022. The report noted that the rally in oil and gas stocks was reflective of the bullish sentiments in the crude oil market, particularly for Seplat Energies which was also expected to make a quarterly dividend payment. In addition, announcement of a board meeting by Oando triggered a buying spree in the stock. The report pointed out that a solid outing for FMCG stocks in first quarter 2022 earnings season bolstered the performance of the consumer goods sector which gained 11.5 per cent in April 2022. Meanwhile, global equities market kickstarted second quarter 2022 on a bearish note as fears of a surge in interest rates underpinned risk-off sentiments towards equities. This was broadly in line with FSDH’s outlook for the month of April as only one of the equity indices tracked across United States (US)and European equities market closed northwards in April. “Heading into May, we continue to advise investors to underweight exposure to stocks for developed economies. This is premised on the expectations of further downside in the US and European markets. Following the FOMC’s decision to hike interest rates by a further 50 basis points-largest move since 2000, we expect investors to remain on the edge as they price in further rate hikes for the rest of the year,” FSDH stated.
