Super Eagles attacker Victor Osimhen put up a decent shift in attack to help Napoli secure a hard-fought 1-0 victory at Torino. The Partenopeans were indomitable the last time they took to the pitch, destroying Sassuolo 6-1 at the Maradona. However, they faced a tricky tie against Torino at the Stadio Olimpico. Nonetheless, Napoli showed class from the start, applying a lot of pressure on the Bulls. The Partenopeans recorded four accurate shots in the first period, two of which were from Osimhen’s boots. Unfortunately, Torino goalkeeper Etrit Berisha was up to the task, maintaining a wall between the sticks.

Captain Lorenzo Insigne fluffed his lines in the 61st minute as he missed a spot-kick. Nonetheless, Fabian Ruiz saved his blushes twelve minutes later. He capitalized on a mistake from the Torino defense, and with support from Osimhen, who served as a decoy, Ruiz fired home past Berisha. Luciano Spalleti’s lads kept a strong defense; even Osimhen dropped back to help his backline. Napoli held out for the remainder of the game to see out the 1-0 victory.
