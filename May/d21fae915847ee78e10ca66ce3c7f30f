Nigeria is barely able to cover the cost of imported petrol from its oil and gas revenues because of low crude oil production means, Finance Minister, Zainab Ahmed, said yesterday when oil prices rose early extending this week’s gains, as demand looks strong with the U.S. driving season starting and Shanghai in China gradually reopening after two months of strict lockdowns. WTI Crude prices were up 3.17 per cent at $113.69 while the international benchmark, Brent Crude, had risen by 2.41 per cent to $116.65. Ahmed added in an interview at the World Economic Forum (WEC) in Davos that she hoped Nigerian oil production would average 1.6 million barrels per day (bpd) this year, up from around 1.5 million bpd in the first quarter (Q1). Nigeria, Africa’s biggest crude oil exporter, imports virtually all its fuel due to moribund state refineries, which has prompted the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC’s) interest in Dangote’s oil refinery.

Uba Sani wins Kaduna APC Gov ticket   Expenditure on subsidies has now hit N6 trillion because of the price of crude oil which has remained above $100 per barrel, according to panelists at the Centre for Petroleum Information (CPI) Oil & Gas Law Forum, entitled: “Implementing Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021: Fixing Arising Legal Issues.” According to the speakers, the price of crude oil was between $55 and $60 per barrel when the Federal Government raised the budget to N4 trillion. But now the price is over $100 per barrel. The cash spent on subsidies between 2010 and 2020 was N1.4 trillion.  The cost increased substantially in 2021 and in 2022 it has hit the stratosphere. Giving a five-year breakdown of the subsidy trajectory, Emeka Akabogu, one of the speakers at the forum, had said the cost of fuel subsidy increased by 890 per cent between 2017 and 2021 with only 12 per cent increase in the price of fuel.
