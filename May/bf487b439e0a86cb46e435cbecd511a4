The Ikeja Constituency 2 Youth Alliance (ICOYA) in Lagos State said it bought the expression of interest and nomination forms for Adedamola Kasunmu to return to the House of Assembly to appreciate his good legislative representation. ICOYA Coordinator Prince Kazeem Haruna, at the presentation ceremony, said: “Kasunmu has been doing a fantastic job since 2015 that he was elected to represent Ikeja Constituency 2. He has assisted a lot of youth with employment opportunities, including myself, and we felt the only thing we can do is to support him.

Kasunmu, who expressed surprise at ICOYA’s gesture, thanked them for buying the forms, and promised to take good representation to the next level as he seeks to represent them again in 2023.
