Actress Nkechi Blessing has reacted to claim by her ex Opeyemi Falegan that she is unhygienic and does not wear pants. The actress, who said her ex is only trying to stay relevant, stated he stopped wearing under wears since she turned 18. In her now deleted Instagram post, she said Falegan might be mistaking her for a 21- year- old he once begged for cash gift. She wrote: “Wow, Just wow. I am glad your lies be staring into your face gidigba. It’s a known fact that I Blessing Sunday have never worn pants since I was 18. Opeyemi, just wow. What a weak comeback bro. “Leave me alone in peace. When talking about hygiene, please clean that rat hole you live in first. This battle is a lost one already. Stay dead please.
