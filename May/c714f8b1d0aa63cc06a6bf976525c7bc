I apologized because I just want bygones to be gone. Not because I want her back. For what? Are you serious? You know why I left? I left for different reasons. Personal hygiene. You have to tell a woman how to change her pants in three days. You have to tell a woman to brush her teeth. And after the whole thing, everywhere is messed up. You want me to manage that? No I wouldn’t. “I even took you to West field, London for Lingerie shopping. Did you wear it? No you didn’t. Why/ Personal hygiene. “So for the online inlaws, if you are angry, you can get married to her. “And you think I should just be calm with it? No. Cleanliness is next to godliness and that’s the fact. I won’t manage that because of online inlaws and you all are angry. “When you say ‘ you guys are supposed to be together. You are perfect together’../ Well, go and get married to her. You will understand. “Someone will be on the same bed with a woman who has not brushed her teeth since morning and has not even changed her underwear in three days all because of love?”
