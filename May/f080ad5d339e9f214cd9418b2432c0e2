The National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, has overruled the disqualification of one of the party’s aspirants for the House of Representatives in Imo State. The aspirant, Mazi Ugochinyere Ikenga, had initially been cleared for the primaries by the Screening Committee set up by the PDP leadership. Curiously, he was handed a disqualification notice a few days after without explanations as to why he was disqualified. Ayu, who overruled Ikenga’s disqualification, said the action was uncalled for and that it was in conflict with the provisions of the PDP constitution.   2023: Mustapha, others dump Amosun camp, join Abiodun     Drama as Police carry detained Rep Dagogo to court on…     PDP’s decision on zoning sacrosanct, says Diri   Consequently, Ikenga was yesterday issued with a clearance certificate jointly signed by Ayu, the National Secretary, Samuel Anyanwu and the National Organising Secretary, Umar Bature. Displaying the clearance certificate at the PDP national secretariat on Friday, Ikenga said his disqualication was orchestrated by some party leaders in Imo State and Abuja. Ikenga, who is a PDP youth activist, described his disqualification as a witch hunt and a plot to exclude him from the primaries without justification. He commended the party chairman for ensuring that justice was done in his case, assuring that he will not only win the primary election, but will also win the election proper.
