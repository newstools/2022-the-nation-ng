In furtherance of its commitment to provide high quality tertiary healthcare services to Lagos State residents and beyond, the management of the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH) has launched a new dialysis unit. According to Prof Adetokunbo Fabamwo, LASUTH Chief Medical Director, the new dialysis unit is dedicated to improving health outcomes for patients who have chronic kidney disease, acute kidney injuries and end stage renal disease. The unit has eight dialysis stations, which cater for a minimum of 22 sessions daily and 660 dialysis sessions monthly. This is in addition to the existing six dialysis machines in the Critical Care Unit (CCU) of the hospital (a private-public venture).

This is a 24-hour, non-stop dialysis machine used to support unstable patients with renal failure. The unit also has two dedicated machines for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Hepatitis patients. The dialysis machine performs some functions of the kidney in filtering waste products and excess fluid from a patient’s blood when the kidneys are malfunctioning. The most common form of dialysis is haemodialysis and a session takes an average of four hours, which is typically carried out three times a week. The new dialysis unit will be providing standard haemodialysis care to patients with all spectrums of renal diseases requiring dialysis. The primary goal is to ensure a safe procedure with the best possible therapeutic outcome by using the latest technology, convenient scheduling and dedicated staff.
