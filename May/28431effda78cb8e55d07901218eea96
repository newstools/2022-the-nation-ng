With top Premier league clubs eying Victor Osimhen’s service. Serie A giants Napoli has set a 47 Billion naira (100 million Euros) price tag on the striker. According to Calciomercato.com, the Premier League is the most likely next destination should the Nigeria international ask to leave the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona with both Manchester United and Newcastle United interested in signing the 23-year-old. According to reports to make Osimhen leave Italy, Newcastle United is set to offer him up to N4 billion (€9million) as salary per year and in January, the Magpies tried to sign him and double his current wage at Napoli. Osimhen was signed from LOSC in France for circa €75m plus bonuses in 2020, although the exact sum of money paid is believed to be closer to €55m, with several player exchanges included in the deal.

However, the offers that did arrive haven’t achieved the minimum asking price, which is at least €100m. The Italian source stated that only Newcastle United have made a formal offer for Osimhen, again below the demands of President Aurelio De Laurentiis. Another issue that could postpone Osimhen’s departure is that Napoli have qualified for the Champions League, unlike Manchester United and Newcastle United.
