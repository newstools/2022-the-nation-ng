Available information showed that TotalEnergies has joined the list of international oil corporations that has hinted of plans to exit Nigeria’s troubled onshore oil fields, a decision that will further impact Nigeria’s dwindling oil revenue. Bloomberg reported that the French energy giant announced it will put up for sale its minority stake in a Nigerian oil joint venture.
