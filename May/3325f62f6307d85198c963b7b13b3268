The likes of Rema, Zlatan, Backroad Gee, Vector, Mayorkun, Dremo, Buju, Big Brother Naija’s Neo, Dorathy, Poco Lee, and others have been patronizing us.” On why he ventured into the business, he said, “Growing up I had always had an intense love for sneakers and streetwear style. It had always been difficult to get original pairs of sneakers as they were no vendors or walk-in stores. I then will mostly rely on my aunties or friends abroad to bring me pairs when they are visiting. “So  in  2021, I was in Dubai at the time and I said to myself why not open up a sneaker store back home in Lagos to have sneaker aficionados like me just walk in and shop for the sneakers they love. That thought birthed Flykicks and today it’s a brand sneakers lovers in Nigeria love.”
