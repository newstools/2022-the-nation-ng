The Chairman, Nigerian Electricity Management Services Agency (NEMSA), Suleiman Yahaya, has reiterated that revenue optimisation through improved service delivery and inter- agency collaboration is vital. He spoke yesterday at the NEMA Board’s Retreat  in Lagos. “This is why we called for this retreat. We are ensuring that we have good synergy with not only Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON), but other government agencies. We want to see how best we can improve on our revenue generation because government has no money to be throwing around,” Yahaya said.

For instance, he explained that in delivering one of its mandate, NEMSA ensures that meters coming into the system are certified and in conformity with the requirement of the country. This is why the agency works in synergy with other agencies like the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON). Buttressing the importance of certifying meters, the Managing Director, NEMSA, Aliyu Tahir, explained that ensuring that meters are certified could not be wished away given that is the measuring can for electricity consumption. “Meters measures electricity usage and if such a gadget is not qualitative or accurate, there is the likelihood of cheating on both the side of the consumer and the operator. This is why we are now ensuring that these meters are being developed to standards and meet our own specifications, like our peculiar climatic conditions,” Tahir said.
