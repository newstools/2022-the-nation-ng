The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) has promised to sanction any institution caught engaging in fraudulent mobilisation of graduates for national service. It said it was determined to plug the loopholes and prosecute anyone found complicit in the mobilisation of unqualified graduates for national service. Director-General Maj.-Gen. Shuaibu Ibrahim stated this during the maiden meeting of NYSC management with registrars of corps producing institutions in Nigeria, held in Abuja. He said the meeting with the theme: “Appreciating the Role of Registrars as Fulcrum in the Mobilisation Process,” was convened to seek ways of eliminating flaws in the NYSC mobilisation process.
