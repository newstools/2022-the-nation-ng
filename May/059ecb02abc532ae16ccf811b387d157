The Student Union Government (SUG) of Federal University in Lokoja, Kogi State, has joined its counterparts across the federation in issuing a seven-day ultimatum to the Federal Government to, as a matter of urgency, resolve the lingering issues with the Academic Staff Union of University (ASUU). It said at the expiration of the ultimatum, they would be left without any option but to embark on a nationwide protest to drive home their demands. The President of the students’ union body, Oguche Ojofeyo, who led his members on a peaceful protest yesterday, made this known while speaking with reporters at the university’s main campus in Lokoja. He said their demand was for the Federal Government to resolve the lingering rancour with ASUU, warning that the SUG might be forced to block all the highways and Federal Government infrastructure if the three months old strike embarked on by ASUU was not resolved within the next seven days.

He described the situation which students had been subjected to, the stagnated academic calendar, as unbearable and unacceptable, noting that “employment has age limit and National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) also comes with an age limit.” The SUG president lamented that the incessant strike had taken its toll on the students’ mental and physiological state. He expressed sadness that the Federal Government’s actions or inaction would have negative effect on the future of the students, since their ages were counting by the day.
