The Minority Caucus in the House of Representatives has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to immediately sign the amendment to the Electoral Act 2022 transmitted to him by the National Assembly to avoid political crisis. The amendment is to allow elected representatives, including the President, Vice President, Governors and Deputy Governors to vote during party primaries as statutory delegates. The amendment was recently passed and transmitted to the President for assent. Minority Leader of the House Ndudi Elumelu said in a statement the President’s delay in signing the single amendment to Section 84 (8) to the Electoral Act 2022 has thrown the nation into serious confusion and constitutes a huge threat to our democracy and the smooth conduct of the 2023 general elections.
