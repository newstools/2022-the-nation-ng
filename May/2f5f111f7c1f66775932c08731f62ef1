The Federal High Court Abuja has adjourned further proceedings in the case against the detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu from Thursday, May 26 to June 28, 2022. This means that the planned sit-at-home for Thursday will no longer hold in the Southeast. IPOB’s lead counsel, Ifeanyi Ejiofor, disclosed this on Wednesday in a statement. Ejiofor said that the reason for the adjournment was due to the fact that His Lordship, Justice Binta Nyako was indisposed. According to him: “Please be informed that we have just received communication from the Federal High Court’s Registrar, notifying us that the Court will no longer be sitting tomorrow, 26th May, 2022, on Onyendu Mazi Nnamdi Kanu’s case.

Keep your eyes on the ball, which is the freedom of Onyendu Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. “Also, please note that Justice delayed is not justice denied.
