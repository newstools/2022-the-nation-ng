Popular Islamic singer, Abdul-Lateef Kehinde Oriyomi, has revealed why he switched from secular music to the Islamic genre. In a chat with The Nation, Oriyomi disclosed that he began his musical career as a Fuji artiste before transitioning professionally into an Islamic singer 15 years ago. “Surprisingly, I started singing at a tender age in 1988 as a Fuji artiste before I switched to Islamic music in 2007,” he said. Explaining his reason, the 44-year-old singer said, “I love to be holy and be in the midst of God-fearing people. So, I believe using my musical skills to praise Almighty Allah will positively influence me and draw me closer to God as well as other believers because I dislike people with unholy lifestyles.

But as a human being, everything we do needs to glorify our creator – your lifestyle, habits, thoughts, speech, and actions.” Since he broke out with his classic album titled, Epemi, in 2007, the vocalist has delighted his fans with five bodies of works. On how he got inspiration, Oriyomi said he is inspired by everything about this world and hereafter. “Firstly, my creativity and inspiration come from God. I also get inspiration from everything about this life – good or bad, people, food, water, news, and events happening around me. Many times, I think about what will happen after this life.”
