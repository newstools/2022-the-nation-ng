The General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor Enoch Adeboye on Friday told the Imo State Imo State governor, Hope Uzodinma, that the security challenges facing Nigeria today were not ordinary but assured that God’s intervention was real and inevitable. According to a statement by the Chief Press Secretary and Media Adviser to the governor, Oguwike Nwachuku, Adeboye said the problem of Nigeria today is beyond human comprehension. Adeboye expressed worries over a situation where non-state actors dictate to the government when people should come out and not to come out. The RCCG overseer was on a visit to the Government House Owerri in the company of some of his senior pastors. Adeboye said his team and members had been fasting and praying for the restitution of the land for days but that God directed him to visit the places and lands across Nigeria where the forces of darkness were enveloping light, hence the visit to Imo for a prayer session.

He said with the visit, henceforth, in Southeast, there must be light. Receiving the General Overseer and his team, Uzodinma described the visit as “a big privilege because Adeboye is believed to be a real anointed man of God.” Uzodinma said Imo people and his government were not in doubt that Pastor Adeboye’s visit would bring peace, unity, and stability to Imo State in particular and the Southeast in general because they were required for progress and development. He described Adebayo as one of the true men of God.
