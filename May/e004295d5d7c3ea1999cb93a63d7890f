Investors in Nigerian equities closed weekend with net capital gains of N598 billion despite the onset of a considerable profit-taking. Investors sought to monetise substantial capital gains built up over weeks of successive rally but gains by large-cap telecommunication stocks rallied the overall market position to a positive closing. Benchmark indices at the Nigerian Exchange (NGX) at the weekend indicated average return of 2.09 per cent, equivalent to net capital gains of N598 billion. The rally nudged the average year-to-date return to 26.61 per cent. The All Share Index (ASI)- the value-based common index that tracks share prices of all quoted equities at the NGX, closed weekend at 54,085.30 points as against its week’s opening index of 52,979.96 points. Aggregate market value of all quoted equities increased correspondingly from its week’s opening value of N28.562 trillion to close at N29.160 trillion. With more than two decliners for every advancer, the positive overall market position was driven majorly by gains recorded by Airtel Africa, the only large-cap stock within the top 10 gainers. On the back of rekindled foreign investors’ appetite, Airtel Africa’s share price rose by 20.2 per cent to close at N1, 767 per share, the third highest gain for the week and the highest for any large-cap stock. The underlying sentiment was generally negative with 54 losers to 23 gainers during the week, compared with 37 gainers and 42 losers recorded in the previous week.

The negative market sentiment is waning. A positive close in the next trading session may signal the beginning of a bullish trend. A negative close may signal a possible retracement,” Analysts at Arthur Stevens Asset Management stated at the weekend. Analysts at Cordros Capital noted that with the recent decision of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to hike the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) by 150 basis points to 13.00 per cent, negative sentiments will dominate market performance in the short term. “Nonetheless, we think a short-term market correction will present opportunities for investors to make re-entry in stocks with sound fundamentals and attractive dividend yields. Overall, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the fragility of the macroeconomic environment remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings,” Cordros Capital stated. .
