Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said his side will take nothing for granted as they head into tonight’s second leg of their Champions League semi-final against Villarreal with a 2-0 lead and that they must treat the game at La Ceramica ‘very carefully’ The final obstacle in Liverpool’s quest to reach a third Champions League final in five seasons sees them head to Spain with a 2-0 advantage after last week’s comprehensive first-leg victory at Anfield. Despite holding a commanding advantage, Klopp is under no illusions there is still a job to be done and is relishing the challenge that only Champions League semi-finals produce. “We know that it is half-time,” Klopp told his pre-match press conference. “In the best possible way we have to ignore the result from the first leg. If it were a cup game where only one game decided, and we had to go to Villarreal, we would try to win there.   Adekuoroye’s sister Shines at Gov.

With all the things Unai said after the game… it’s going to be a tough one but that is completely fine. Champions League semi-finals should be tough; we never expect them to be easy and this will not be easy. But we played a good game at home and we better play a good game there as well.” Yet Unai Emery insisted yesterday that Villarreal are not playing for pride but believe they can beat Liverpool and still reach the Champions League final, despite their 2-0 defeat in the first leg last week. “In the first leg, they were better but tomorrow we are not just playing for pride, we are playing to win,” said Emery in a press conference. “Liverpool this season have not lost a game by more than two goals so we will have to play a perfect match, to be outstanding in everything we do. We’ll have to find more of their weaknesses.”
