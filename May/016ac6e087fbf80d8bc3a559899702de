The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) yesterday said fake Muslims are behind senseless killings. CAN rejoiced with the Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA) and Muslim faithful as they celebrate Eid-el-Fitri. The association urged them to continue to abide by the teachings and the principles of Ramadan in their daily activities, as exemplified by the prophet, during and after the Eid celebrations. A statement by the National General-Secretary, Daramola Joseph, reads: “The Christian Association of Nigeria rejoices with Alhaji Sa’ad Abubakar III, the Sultan of Sokoto and President-General, Nigeria Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA), and the entire Muslims as they celebrate this year’s Eid-el-Fitr.   IG orders security at prayer grounds, others     Sanwo-Olu, Obasa urge peaceful co-existence, spirituality     Sultan to Nigerians: elect quality leaders   “Since the month, among other things, aims to purify the soul and bring the individual closer to God, we urge you all to abide by the teaching and the principles of Ramadan in your daily activities. We know it is these pseudo-Muslims who are slaughtering fellow human beings, and who burn worship and market places, all in the name of God who is peace personified. We are praying for their repentance. “The CAN leadership will not cease having dialogues on peace and unity with the leadership of NSCIA at the forum provided for us by the Nigeria Inter-Religious Council (NIREC). “We also call on the Federal Government to reconsider the de-radicalising and rehabilitation of the arrested and the surrendered terrorists because it seems the programme considered laudable is becoming counterproductive. Once again, CAN rejoices with our Muslim counterparts and pray that their prayers and restraints during the month will not be in vain.”
