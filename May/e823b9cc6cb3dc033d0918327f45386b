As the race for the ticket of the House of Representatives for Ikorodu Federal Constituency on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) hots up, the leadership has been urged to encourage only indigenes to contest the ticket. One of the aspirants, Mr. AbdulKareem Shittu, made this known to reporters in Lagos yesterday. He said Ikorodu had always been known to encourage ‘indigeneship’, adding that it would therefore be out of place to allow non-indigenes to contest the House of Representatives ticket. Shittu said: “Things cannot be different now.”   My experience under Buhari places me ahead of others, says…     Abiru submits senatorial nomination form     Why I will stand with Yahaya Bello, by Hafsat Abiola   Our correspondent gathered that four aspirants have thrown their hats into the ring and have been working to win the ticket. Shittu said: “There has always been a clamour for an indigene of Ikorodu to emerge as the candidate of the party. There are three indigenous councils in Lagos State, namely Epe, Badagry and Ikorodu. Of these three, Ikorodu is the only one that is not considering an indigene to represent it from our party. This is wrong. “You will recall that traditionalists from Ijede-Imota went on parade recently, warning anyone who deviates from the rotational arrangement in place in the federal constituency, as it concerns the House of Assembly election. The indigenes of Ikorodu, including the traditional institutions, are mobilising people to make sure natives are fielded for positions in PDP and APC.” The aspirant added: “Ikorodu Local Government has never since inception had an executive chairman who is a non-indigene. Also, since 1999, the Reps member for the constituency has always been an indigene. The current Reps member, Babajimi Benson, is an indigene of Ikorodu. So, why will the case of PDP be different if we really want to grab the House of Representatives ticket?”
