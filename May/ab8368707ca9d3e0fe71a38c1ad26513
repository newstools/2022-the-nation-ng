Sen. Ibrahim Shekarau (APC -Kano) has defected to the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP). Shekarau said this at a news conference in Kano. He said that he defected alongside his supporters, saying that he would seek re-election to the Senate on the NNPC platform. Shekarau said that he left the All Progressives Congress (APC) because the leadership of the party in the state failed to fulfil its promises of carrying alongside his supporters in the scheme of things. “In spite of our immesurable contributions, our members were dismayed by lack of corresponding appreciation and reciprocal gesture by the state leadership.

Shekarau said that state congresses of the party were not conducted in line with the stipulated guidelines. (NAN)
