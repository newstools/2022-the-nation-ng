Common house rat Who feigned the lineage of lions Until History counted his claws   And uncovered a missing fire An angry wind blew; your phantom mane Rolled deviously down your shortening neck     You, the King’s slave Who never stopped thinking   Osun community under siege as land grabbers unleash terror     Virgins usually have first class brains!
