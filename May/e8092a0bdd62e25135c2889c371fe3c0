He is an agile player, positive on the ball, and isn’t afraid to take people on. It’s good to have characters and players like that in the team.” “I’m an attacking and defensive full-back. I’d say I’m pretty quick and good on the ball, and I used to look up to David Alaba before he moved to centre-back. I’m versatile, and I have played left-back in a few games this season as well as in my more natural position on the right,” he added. He however, described the Super Eagles 2018 World Cup kit as his favourite. “I really like the Nigeria international kit from the 2018 World Cup. I was a big fan of the design and colour way.”
