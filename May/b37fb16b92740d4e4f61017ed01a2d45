Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has warned the General Superintendent of Deeper Life Bible Church, Pastor William Kumuyi, against the planned crusade in Aba, Abia State. It advised him no to go ahead with the crusade in view of the insecurity in the Southeast. In a statement by its Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, IPOB said there was the likelihood of criminals operating as unknown gunmen infiltrating the event and would blame it on the group. IPOB urged the cleric and other pastors to pray for an end to insecurity and its sponsors in the zone, as well as demand justice for the late Deborah Yakubu and release of Leah Shuaibu.

The security situation of this region is not good because of political and criminal activities. Therefore, we advise him to stop this crusade for security reasons. “IPOB will not allow anyone to die because of this crusade scheduled to hold in Aba. The operation of criminals operating as unknown gunmen, infiltrating events, is high and they will blame it on IPOB. “We implore Kumuyi to pray for an end to insecurity in the Southeast. We call on Christians and other clerics to engage God in fervent prayers to expose those behind insecurity in our land.”
