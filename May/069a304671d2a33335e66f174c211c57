Algerian football legend Rabah Madjer has been appointed as an ambassador for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. The 63-year-old, who is most renowned for scoring in the final of and winning the European Cup (UEFA Champions League) with Porto in 1987, as well as claiming Africa Cup of Nations glory with Algeria in 1990, is an icon of Arab culture. “I am very happy to be named ambassador for this 2022 World Cup,” Madjer said on social media, as quoted by DZFoot.
