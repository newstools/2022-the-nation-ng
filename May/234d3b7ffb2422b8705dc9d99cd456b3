Nollywood actor Jide Kene has opined that some actors’ work ethic may have triggered people into thinking that there is a caucus in Nollywood. Kene, during a chat with The Nation, said that while some actors prefer to be selective in the roles they take, others prefer to do large numbers of movies within a very short time frame. He vindicated movie producers from such accusations noting that it is the availability of actors that determines their visibility on certain movie sets.   Anticipate my new single Pemi Samba, says Lobor     ManiX, TesKi launch indie label with Rock with me     Why I switched from Fuji to Islamic music 15 years ago, by…   “It’s not the fault of the producers per se it’s the structure of the industry what do I mean by structure? For example, the TV and films are not as expensive to make as compared to the cinema projects, so certain people are comfortable with making eight movies over some time and making a decent amount of money also other people would wait for one blockbuster and make the same amount of money.” Continuing, he said, “So most times it depends on how an actor or producer decides to accept themselves. It is difficult to catch me on a certain platform because maybe they shoot within five days and will rather develop my character over two months do you understand what I’m saying it can always tell some people are experts at going from sets to sets and still delivering the same thing but I like to immerse myself. “Living in Bondage took six months, work of arts basically when you finish you drop the pen. Some other person can do that within one week and have two or three million CD sales in the East. I have friends like that Zuby Michael no dey tire na energy god and he is very good at what he does yeah so that’s it.”
