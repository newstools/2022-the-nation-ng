The tournament had over 350 representatives of public and private primary students from the country’s six geopolitical zones. The Founder of WAFSTS, High Chief Dr (Mrs) Winifred Awosika OON, while speaking at the tournament finale, said: “We were worried about holding this tournament due to circumstances unraveling around the country, but we are happy to have organised this edition after the Covid-19 break. This tournament was borne out of my passion for vocabulary and reasoning development among students, for which Scrabble is a veritable tool. We are happy that this tournament which started as a competition among schools in Lagos has now gone national.” Also speaking at the finale, the President of Nigeria Scrabble Federation, Engr. Olobatoke Aka, said the activities of the Winifred Awosika Foundation aligned with the mandate of the federation. “Our mandate is to pursue the development of the game of Scrabble from the grassroots. Scrabble is a very important game in education because you play and learn at the same time. What the Winifred Awosika Foundation Scrabble Tournament is doing aligns with the mandate of the Nigeria Scrabble Federation, and we are pleased to partner with you on this project,” he said.
