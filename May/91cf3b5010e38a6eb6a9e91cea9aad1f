Ahead of the June 18 2022 governorship election in Ekiti State, the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate in the state, Biodun Oyebanji, has advised his Social Democratic Party (SDP) counterpart, Segun Oni, to withdraw if he is not ready for a real contest in the forthcoming poll. By utterances and dispositions, APC candidate alleged that Oni was posing as if he was expecting himself to be imposed on Ekiti, rather than a real contest going by phantom accusations he had allegedly been raising against the ruling party to gain relevance.

Debunking the claim, Oyebanji, who spoke through the Director of Media and Publicity of his campaign outfit, Taiwo Olatunbosun, told the former governor not to expect to become Ekiti governor on a platter of gold or via undemocratic fashion. Oyebanji said the people of Ekiti would elect who would govern them through a keen and democratic process and not by imposition, thuggery and raising of unfounded accusations for cheap political capital.
