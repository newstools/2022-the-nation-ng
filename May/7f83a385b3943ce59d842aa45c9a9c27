The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) Lagos Industrial Command on Thursday gave companies not yet registered for payment of excise duty under its command 14-days to comply or face sanctions. Comptroller Queen Ogbudu of the Lagos Industrial Command said this during a stakeholders’ meeting in Lagos. According to her, the 14 days grace will start from May 27 after which an enforcement action will be conducted and defaulting companies will have their premises sealed and face the full wrath of the law. “We are appealing to other factories that are not yet under the excise control because of the fact that they are not aware or they are hiding, they want to avoid paying excise duty, to come forward.
