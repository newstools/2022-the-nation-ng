Frenchman Jean-Louis Gasset has been appointed as the new coach of Cote Ivoire on an initial 12-month contract. The West African country is set to host the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations finals in June next year and the 68-year-old has the option of a further year in his deal. He replaces compatriot Patrice Beaumelle, whose contract was not renewed after the Elephants missed out on World Cup qualification and suffered a last-16 exit at the Nations Cup in Cameroon earlier this year.

He has managed French clubs Montpellier, Caen, Istres, Saint-Etienne and Bordeaux, who Gasset left at the end of last season. Former Ivory Coast midfielder Emerse Fae – who played for Nantes, Reading and Nice – has been named his assistant. The Elephants are two-time Nations Cup champions, last lifting the trophy in 2015, and are taking part in qualifiers for next year’s tournament despite being assured of a place at the finals as hosts.
