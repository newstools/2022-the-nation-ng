The leadership of the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) has  approved the postponement of its House of Representatives primaries by one day. In a statement signed by the National Organising Secretary of the party, Mr. Ifeanyi Mbaeri, the APGA said that the shift was to avoid a clash with the date of the court trial of the leader of proscribed indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) which results in a sit-at-home in most parts of the Southeast states. A statement by the party reads: “Due to the ongoing court trial of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu which has been adjourned to May 26, 2022 and the resultant sit-at-home in the South East, it has become imperative for the party to reschedule its House of Representatives primaries earlier scheduled for the same May 26, 2022. “Consequently, the House of Representatives Primary Election of APGA will hold nationwide on May 27, 2022.”   Former NDDC official, Turnah, jailed four years     NNPP, party to beat in 2023 says National Chairman     Oil money not paid into FG account since January, says Obi   Mbaeri said that the party has duly notified the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) of the adjustment in dates. The party however said that other primary elections of the party will hold as  originally scheduled. “For clarity, the dates for APGA primaries are as follows: State House of Assembly: (May 24, 2022), House of Representatives: (May 27, 2022), Senate: (May 28, 2022)”.
