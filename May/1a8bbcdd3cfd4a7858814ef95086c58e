Chelsea’s Antonio Rudiger says “difficult” contract negotiations and a lack of communication are the reasons behind his departure from the club. The defender, whose deal with the Blues expires this summer, was offered a contract worth more than £200,000 to stay at Chelsea. However, Real Madrid have agreed on a deal to sign the German international. “I leave this club with a heavy heart. It has meant everything to me,” Rudiger told The Players’ Tribune.

He has made over 200 appearances for Chelsea, winning the Champions League, Europa League, Club World Cup and the FA Cup. “We’re not robots, you know? You cannot wait for months with so much uncertainty about your future,” he said.
