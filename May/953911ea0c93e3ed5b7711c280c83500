The Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, has urged the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) to work toward the improvement of domestic leagues. Dare made the call when he hosted the U-20 men’s national team, the Flying Eagles in Abuja, following their victory at the WAFU B zone championship in Niamey, Niger Republic. The minister said the performance showed the commitment of the board of the NFF toward improving football in the country. “I want you to maintain the same level of discipline on all sides. The future of football is in the hands of these young ones and we must do all to ensure it remains the same,” he said. “One way is to ensure that is the rebirth of our leagues and give it the quality it desires. This is the only way we can have players who will go on to play for Super Eagles as well as top clubs in Europe.” “We will continue to work and support you where necessary and I must say that I am proud of what you have done,’’ the minister said.
