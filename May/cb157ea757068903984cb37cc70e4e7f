Commercial motorcyclists yesterday set two houses ablaze in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja. Findings revealed that the mayhem started when a driver rammed into some okada riders in the Kabusa area of the city, killing three riders. The incident happened in Global Estate in Kabusa area of Lokogoma. The okada riders chased the driver into the estate, setting the gatehouse and another one on fire. Mr. John Okechukwu, a resident, told our correspondent that the motorcyclists were shouting: “We must fish him out”. It took the efforts of the police and the military to rescue the residents and prevent more havoc by the okada riders.

Ahead of the rumoured plans by commercial motorcyclists to disrupt activities in Lagos State from June 1, over the ban of their operations in six councils, the police Command has assured residents that breakdown of law and order would not be allowed. The assurance followed apprehensive messages shared across social media platforms advising residents to stay indoors or close to their homes to avoid falling victims of the planned rampage by aggrieved motorcyclists. Reacting to the viral message, the police command’s spokesman, SP Benjamin Hundeyin, said the Commissioner of Police has directed all necessary human, material and operational resources to be deployed across the state. “All Area Commanders, Divisional Police Officers and tactical commanders have been placed on red alert towards any eventuality,” Hundeyin said yesterday.
