Investigations revealed that already, the erosion has affected the Magistrate Court, a police post, a concrete landing jetty and Anglican Church located in the community. It was found that some buildings in the community had been washed away by the disaster, which residents said had become a recurrent decimal.

Jonathan, who led members of the council to Anyama said the community was at the verge of extinction if urgent steps were not taken to remedy the situation. He lamented that most communities in the state had continued to witness terrible devastation despite the existence of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) and the Ecological Fund.
