Super Eagles trio of Joe Aribo, Leon Balogun, and Calvin Bassey would be playing at this year’s Europa League final as Rangers sensationally booked their spot in the finals after overcoming RB Leipzig 3-1 to win on 3-2 aggregate. The hosts got off to the perfect start at Ibrox with James Tavernier tapping home from close range to send the crowd into pandemonium. Then, minutes later, the Ibrox faithful were sent into hysteria as Glen Kamara scored superbly from outside the box to turn the tie on its head. It could’ve been 3-0 before the half-hour mark but Aribo fluffed his lines just yards out, failing to get a proper connection on the ball to put Rangers in complete control.

Aribo had to be substituted for Fashion Sakala at halftime after getting injured while Leon Balogun replaced Ryan Jack in the 59th minute. Bassey, who was a rock in the Gers defence, was on the field the entire duration. Meanwhile, Kelechi Iheanacho and Ademola Lookman could not help Leicester reach the first-ever Europa Conference League final as the Foxes fell to a 1-0 defeat to Jose Mourinho’s AS Roma who will face Cyriel Dessers’ Feyenoord in the final at the Air Albania Stadium in Albania later in the month.
