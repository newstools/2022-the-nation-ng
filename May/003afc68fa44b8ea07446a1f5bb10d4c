Mrs Akande said the event could serve as a stimulus to further boost the productivity of the MSMEs sector and praised NASSI for holding the fair in the past five years. She, however, challenged other Business Membership Organisations (BMOs) to start a similar programme where small businesses could showcase their products, and solve the challenge of access to market.
