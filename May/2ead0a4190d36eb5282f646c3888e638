The Association of Bureaux De Change Operators of Nigeria (ABCON) has called for the establishment of Bureaux De Change (BDCs) Autonomous Foreign Exchange Trading Window (BAFEX) to restore sanity to the market and make forex available to more parties. ABCON said the mechanism, which would serve as a pathway to mainstreaming BDCs into the official foreign exchange (FX) management system, would enable its members to source foreign currencies from banks and other autonomous sources and offer a window for regulation of their activities. This comes as naira faces fresh volatility, slipping to nearly  N600/$ at parallel market. ABCON National Executive Council, in a statement, said its inclusion in the retail market would reduce the pressure and stabilise the market. It said it has concluded at a meeting in Lagos to kick-start a strategic campaign to save the local currency, bridge the supply gaps in the markets and curb the  volatility. Its President, Aminu Gwadabe, said there was the urgent need to enhance FX liquidity to stabilise the exchange rate for predictable economic planning.He said its campaigns were aimed at mitigating the volatility that comes with election spends. The ABCON boss pointed to growing illiquidity and supply shock as key factors manufacturers and others find it difficult to access FX from the official sources. He said the leadership of the body would intensify campaigns among traders to help reduce the market arbitrage, which is about N175 per dollar.

ABCON under my leadership will continue to encourage our members to play a vital role in closing the exchange rate gaps in the market and reducing the premium between the parallel market and the official window,” he said. Gwadabe listed several factors, which he said, have continued to undermine efforts to stabilise the market, saying its proposed BAFEX would go a long way to save the situation. He said a template would be worked out to enable BDCs to access FX from banks, autonomous market and diaspora remittance widow at prevailing market prices. Gwadabe also requested the enhancement of BDCs’ automation portals to file transaction returns on CBN/ABCON/NFIU/NIBSS portals for effective monitoring, saying the members were ready to comply with the regulations. “The BDCs should be able to operate a network of digital solutions for PTA/BTA. This would reduce overheads, and improve profitability. Some BDCs might still consider working closer with commercial banks. The ABCON can also be recognised as a self-regulatory organisation to enable it to operate effectively and sanction erring members “We wish to reiterate our resolve to align with the policy thrust of the apex bank and ensure that ABCON members play their roles professionally and strategically in the interest of the market and economy,” he said. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) stopped its weekly funding of BDCs last July, citing abuses and market manipulation as a reason for the action. Since then, the FX crisis has continued.
