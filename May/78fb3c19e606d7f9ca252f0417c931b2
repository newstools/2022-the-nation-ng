A political support group, The Patriots for Ogbonnaya Onu, has appealed to All Progressives Congress (APC) to adopt Onu as its consensus presidential standard bearer to retain power  in 2023. The group said the emergence of the former Minister of Science and Technology as president in 2023 will foster unity, put the interest of all above sectional interest, fight corruption and tackle insecurity. Convener of the group, Prof. Hakeem Fawehinmi, who spoke during a briefing in Abuja, said Onu is a detribalised, honest, nationalist and silent achiever, who believes in meritocracy as against sentiments. Fawehinmi, who is a former Deputy Vice Chancellor (Academics) at University of Port Harcourt, said Onu,as civilian governor of old Abia State in 1991, promoted national unity by abolishing state of origin syndrome and appointed non-indigenes to key political and administrative positions.

The ex-DVC said  Onu promoted the rule of law in business by stressing transparency, discipline and punctuality and mobilised the people of Abia for sustainable development through infrastructural, educational, health and social welfare. He said: “For the sake of the country’s fragile democratic governance and in the interest of natural justice, all parties should rise above partisanship and regional sentiments and cede their presidential ticket in 2023 election to Southeast. “Onu’s election will assuage the feeling of real or perceived marginalisation among Ndigbo that constitute about a quarter of the country’s population. “We urge APC to adopt Dr Ogbonnaya Onu as its consensus presidential standard bearer to retain power in 2023”.
