The All Progressives Congress (APC) senatorial screening committee under the chairmanship of former governor of Zamfara State, Mahmood Shinkafi, has screened and cleared a senatorial aspirant for Oyo South District, Olooye Adegboyega Adegoke, for the primary election slated for May 24. The senatorial hopeful pledged good and equal representation for the nine local governments that made up the senatorial district. Other members of the screening committee are Chief Peter Ojie, Miss Busari Abisayo and Prince Abdullahi Yau, while Chief Ejike Nwosu is the secretary.   PDP urged to field indigene for Ikorodu Federal Constituency…     My experience under Buhari places me ahead of others, says…     Abiru submits senatorial nomination form   The nine councils are Ibadan North, Ibadan North East, Ibadan North West, Ibadan South East, Ibadan South West, Ibarapa Central, Ibarapa East, Ibarapa North and Ido. Speaking after his screening, Adegoke, a Fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (FCA) and business turnaround expert, said the first hurdle had been scaled. He said the screening had cleared a way for him to face other contenders, adding that with God on his side, his teeming supporters and the confidence the party leadership had in him, he was confident that the journey to the red chambers would be successful. Adegoke, an alumnus of Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ile-Ife and University of Cambridge Judge Business School Advanced Leadership Programme, said despite that Ibadan had six local governments and Ibarapa had three, both zones would get best and equal representation from him.
