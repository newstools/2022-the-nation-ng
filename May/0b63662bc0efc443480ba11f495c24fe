The Governor of Ekiti, Dr Kayode Fayemi, says he will introduce modern technology to provide security across the country if he is elected as the president in 2023. Fayemi, one of the aspirants on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), said this on Saturday in Jos during his interaction with the party delegates. “I will improve on intelligence gathering, processing and introduce significantly the use of technology; satellite and drone technology in the management of security challenges. “These are fundamentals that we must do because the flip side of security is development.

Fayemi also told the delegates that he would work hard to strengthen national cohesion, devolve responsibilities and resources to the sub-national levels. “I know what states are going through and I know that we can build a partnership that works, a partnership that can strengthen the Nigerian unity and that partnership needs not be top down. “It can be coordinated rather than subordinated and it can be a partnership between the centre and the sub-nationals,” he said. The Chairman of APC in Plateau, Mr Rufus Bature, in his remarks, said that Nigeria needed intellectual minds like Fayemi to lead. He said that the state delegates would critically assess all the aspirants and settle for the best.(NAN)
