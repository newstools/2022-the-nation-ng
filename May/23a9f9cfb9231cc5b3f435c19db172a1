Chairman of Ibadan Football Association (IFA), Rotimi Alli has praised Governor of Oyo State, Engineer Seyi Makinde over the renovation of Olubadan stadium. Speaking at a Ramadan get-together held for members of the Oyo State chapter of the Sports Writers Association of Nigeria (SWAN), Alli commended Makinde for the facelift of the ancient stadium. “I am not a politician but just a sports-loving legal practitioner. So I didn’t lobby for this ongoing renovation of Olubadan stadium. The Governor came of his own volition and started to give the stadium a new look,” Alli said.
