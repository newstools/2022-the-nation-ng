She introduced our Provincial Sister Philomena and her team to them.  I met with an agent, but insisted on meeting with the owners of the company. ”The reason I requested to see them is because the price was too high for us. But as God will have it, after talking to the chairman and sharing the word of God with him that God comes first, not money, he beat down the price to what we can afford.  When I met the chairman, I could tell from the way he interacted with us that he is a trust worthy man, thereby making it easy for us to arrive at a comfortable agreement. ”That was how we got the land. Our plan is to build a school there.” She thanked the promoters of the project and promised to take over the site soon.
