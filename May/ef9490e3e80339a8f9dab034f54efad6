The conversion with a legal 1.9 wind would be 9.84, which would put him second in collegiate history behind former Tennessee Vol and 2017 The Bowerman winner Christian Coleman. In addition, Ashe ran the second leg of Tennessee’s 4×100-meter relay which finished in 38.99 seconds – the ninth-quickest time in school history and the 13th-fastest in the U.S. this year. This is Ashe’s first runner of the week award after being named freshman of the week on two occasions during the indoor season. It is the fourth time this year that Tennessee have earned a weekly conference honor.
