The Chief Whip of the Senate, Sen. Orji Kalu, has condemned the gruesome murder of a student of Shehu Shahari College of Education, Sokoto, Ms Deborah Samuel. Yakubu was set ablaze by her course mates who accused her of blasphemy to Prophet Muhammed (SAW). Kalu, in a statement issued on Friday in Abuja, described the act as evil, cruel and barbaric. The former governor of Abia urged the Sokoto State Government, security agencies and authorities of the higher institution to work harmoniously in bringing the perpetrators to book. Kalu said that the late Yakubu was killed in her prime and emphasised that the ugly incident must be condemned in totality. While commiserating with the family of the deceased, Kalu urged students of the institution to shun violence and social vices.
