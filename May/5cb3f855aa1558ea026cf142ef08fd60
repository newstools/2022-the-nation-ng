Big Brother Naija’s ex-housemate, Prince Nelson Enwerem has opined that not meeting up to the public and fans’ expectations could lead to depression. Prince submitted that many ex-housemates are put under pressure and some even go as far as comparing themselves with other members of their alumnus. “Some people didn’t get a deal the first year out of the house but the deals they got years after were humongous. It takes a lot of strength and condition mind-wise to be able to stand firm and do what you have to do. If you can’t control what happens in your space you will fall off on the way,” he said.

He went further to say, “if you are not able to comport yourself if you are not able to stand strong on what you are doing and know that it’s not a sprint but a marathon, a career that you have to take your time.
