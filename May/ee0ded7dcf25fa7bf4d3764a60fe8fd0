Nigerian striker Odion Ighalo scored one and provided another assist to inspire Al Hilal to a 4-2 comeback win over Damak in the Saudi Pro League. Ighalo had fired blanks as Al Hilal stumbled to a 2-2 draw at home to Sharjah Cultural Club and lost 0-2 to Al Rayyan, both in the AFC Champions League, before losing 2-0 at Al Feiha in a league game. But the former Manchester United striker was his side’s best performer as the reigning champions secured their 15th win of the campaign.

Ighalo has scored eight goals in eight league matches since his January move from Al Shabab, with his overall 20 goals still the best in the division.
