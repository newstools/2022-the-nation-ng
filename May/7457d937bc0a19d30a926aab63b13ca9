Nigeria international midfielder Joe Aribo is upbeat that his Glasgow Rangers side would ride the storm to win their first Europa League trophy when they face German Bundesliga side , Eintracht Frankfurt tonight at the Ramón Sánchez-Pizjuán Stadium in Seville in Spain. The 25-year-old Aribo is regarded as a key cog in the Rangers engine room this season as the Scottish side eliminated two German clubs in the knockout stages including Dortmund in the knockout round play-offs as well as Leipzig in the last four. Speaking to RTV, Aribo who would be in the company of his two compatriots defenders Leon Balogun and Calvin Bassey, said the rank and file of Rangers was buzzing ahead of tonight’s Europa League final showdown. “It’s an amazing feeling,” noted Aribo who has made an impressive sixteen appearances in this season’s Europa League.“ The boys are buzzing; you can see around the camp that the moods just high and spirits are high and it’s really good to have.” Rangers have been imperious under coach Gio van Bronckhorst and Aribo reckoned the Dutch along with his coaching staff has bolstered their confidence coupled as they chase their first European silverware since 1972 when the Gers won the now rested European Cup Winners’ Cup.

We knew before if we could get a good result to take back to Ibrox, it meant we could get a result against any team. It’s different here but you will hear our fans tomorrow(today)” The 47-year-old former Barcelona and Arsenal midfielder would further underlined the quality of their opponents tonight : “I see a lot of similarities with Dortmund and Leipzig. They are very well organised and play the same system as Leipzig, they are fast in transition and can be quite dangerous. “ They deserve to be in the final because of those great ties against Barcelona and West Ham. They are also here because they deserve it. It’s two clubs with a lot of history and loyal fan base so it will be exciting.”
