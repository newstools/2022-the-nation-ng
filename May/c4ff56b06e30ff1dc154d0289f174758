The Coordinator Abuja Metropolitan Management Council (AMMC), Shuaib Umar, has warned developers who do not adhere to standards to desist or face the law. He spoke  during a stakeholders’ meeting with  the management and residents associations of Trademore Estate at at the Federal Capital Territory Authority (FCTA). Umar said the solution to this was the removal of  such  houses. “Even a single house could cause problems for so many people. If that  house is not constructed where it is supposed to be constructed,” he stated. Also, the Director of Development Control, Muktar Galadima, who led a demolition squad to one of the contravening estates, in Lugbe District, said it was appalling that developers were jeopardising lives.

He also said over 20 houses built along waterways at Trademore Estate and others would be demolished, after the ultimatum given to them. Galadima said: “Now is the moment. Those houses marked for removal are going. Anything that would come after can be resolved. The first thing is to save lives and properties. “This demolition will not only be limited to Trademore Estate, even the downstream, we are going to remove the houses that are on the flood plain.” Meanwhile, a representative of Trademore Estate,  Ifeanyi Uzoigwe, said there was the need for FCTA to evaluate a dam owned by FCTA at Alieta, which has collapsed and is contributing to the flooding.
