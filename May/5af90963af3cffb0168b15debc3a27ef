Content creator Mr Macaroni has carpeted former Vice President Atiku Abubakar for deleting a post where he condemned the murder of a Christian student Deborah Samuel by religious fanatics in Sokoto. The skit maker, who vehemently flayed the killing, said Atiku’s decision to pull down the condemnation post on his social media platforms confirms elites only care about being in power than well being of the citizens. Mr Macaroni tweeted: “Atiku deleting the tweet condemning the gruesome murder of Deborah shows what we have been preaching this whole election season.   Tems’ voice connects with my soul, says American…     Ex-lover: Nobody said anything when Nkechi Blessing called…     I was not born with a silver spoon – Omoni Oboli   “Politicians don’t care for the people. They only play to the gallery when seeking our votes. The people must see beyond these gimmicks… “Every citizen has a right to life! No person or group of persons have the right to take the life of another citizen!!! “You cannot kill another in the name of defending your religion. Do we all start killing ourselves in the name of religion?? It is inhumane and it must.”
