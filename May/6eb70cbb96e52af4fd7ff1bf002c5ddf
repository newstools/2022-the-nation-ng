Former Rangers star Kevin Thomson believed Nigeria international midfielder Joe Aribo could be the game-changer for the Gers when they clash with Leipzig in the second leg of their Europa League semifinal clash. Aribo has been an integral part of Rangers’ set-up, making 53 appearances in all competitions for the Gers this season. The 25-year-old has featured in all of Rangers’ games in the Europa League, notching three assists in 13 appearances. His performances have been significant in helping Gers to their first European semifinal in 14 years. Even though they face a strong Leipzig side, Rangers gave a good account of themselves, taking a one-goal deficit away from the Red Bull Arena. Rangers welcome Leipzig to Ibrox tomorrow, and it promises to be an exciting tie, as the Gers have to come back from a one-goal deficit to ensure a final berth.

And he believes that Aribo could be the decider if his former side is going to get anything from the fixture. “With Alfredo Morelos and Roofe out injured, Joe provided that physicality upfront against Leipzig(in the first leg),” Thomson told Sunsport. “His performance in the second half was brilliant under the circumstances. “There is every chance he’ll be asked to perform that role again(in the return leg). The manager has faith in him to do that job, and I’m sure he will come up with the goods. Rangers are down by a goal from the first leg, and they would need to win by at least a two-goal margin if they want to play in their first European final in fourteen years.
