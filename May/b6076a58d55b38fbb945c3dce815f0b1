The lawmaker had distributed commercial buses, instituting a talent hunt for young and talented footballers in conjunction with Roma Football Academy of Italy, some of who have been taken to Abuja en route to Italy for trials. He has also helped in job placements in Lagos. Idimogu said: “If most of our youths are employed, some of the upheavals being witnessed  would not have been rearing their ugly heads. “Unemployment is a huge problem. Things are difficult this time around. But I will continue to do my best possible. I want to do more for my people. I want to perform because I am responsible to my people and I must continue to associate with my brothers and sisters to make things work.”
