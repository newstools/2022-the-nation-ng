England legend Michael Owen is expecting a terrific spectacle when Rangers host RB Leipzig at Ibrox tomorrow night. The former Liverpool and England striker reckons the Europa League semi-final is on a knife-edge with Leipzig bringing a one-goal lead to Glasgow against the side that has Nigerian trio of Joe Aribo, Leon Balogun and Calvin Bassey. And while he views the result in Germany as a decent scoreline for Rangers after not being at their best – Owen has warned of Leipzig’s threat away from home. He suggested Leipzig could cause real problems on the break with Rangers needing a result to claim a Europa League final spot. However, he also questioned Rangers’ goal-scoring prowess as he pinpointed a possible return for Aaron Ramsey as a key factor in the tie. “It was by no means a bad result, and this tie could go either way.

I’m leaning towards a 1-1 draw.” Giovanni van Bronckhorst revealed he’s still unsure whether he’ll have Kemar Roofe or Ramsey available tomorrow night when quizzed this morning. He explained: “We still have one final training session. “At the moment I can’t say if Roofe or Ramsey will make the squad tomorrow.”
