THE President, African Development Bank (AfDB), Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, has said that the bank has secured 15.6 billion dollars investment for the construction of the Lagos-Abidjan highway. NAN said Adesina tweeted this on his Twitter handle @akin_adesina . He said that the investment would strengthen regional trade and integration in West Africa by linking the hinterlands of different Participating Member Countries (PMCs). The president said that the investment would include providing seaport access to landlocked countries and some transition states of West Africa to the vibrant seaports. The Lagos-Abidjan highway interconnects the capital cities of five Western African States, covering approximately 1,028 km and eight border crossings.
