The Chief Medical Officer of Savealife Mission Hospital, Dr. Richard Okoye, has extolled the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) after his hospital’s Cathlab saved an Imo State-based surgeon, Dr. Damien Oparaocha. Oparaocha was said to have passed out after suffering a heart attack. But he was revived using the Cathlab equipment. Okoye, during a chat with reporters, explained how a CBN loan of N500 million, which was facilitated by Access Bank, helped in funding the CathLab, a medical facility for treating heart attacks and other heart related problems.

In fact, my bank called me and said congratulations that the CBN has approved N500 million to us. “When the approval was given, a team of CBN inspectors from Port Harcourt and Abuja came around. Quite unlike what anybody expected, they were more mindful of the stage of the project and the benefits, with emphasis on job creation. They came in with a checklist. I was overwhelmed, and impressed.  As a matter of fact, there is hope for Nigeria.” Dr. Oparaocha has continued to thank the hospital for saving his life saying. “I want to thank God for keeping me alive today. If it were not for God, and the prompt medical intervention, I would have been dead. The facility that is in Savealife Mission Hospital called a CathLab saved my life. If not for the CathLab, it wouldn’t have been possible for prompt intervention in my own case and in the case of other people who may need this intervention.”
