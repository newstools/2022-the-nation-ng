Harry Maguire has reportedly married partner Fern Hawkins with guests not told the location of the low-key ceremony until the day. Maguire and long-term girlfriend Fern tied the knot at Crewe Registry Office yesterday with the Manchester United defender going straight to the venue following training this morning. The Mirror claimed  guests were told the venue of Crewe Registry Office in a text message earlier yesterday with the couple having kept the details secret from all but their closest family and friends. They will reportedly take their marriage vows again in France this summer at a romantic ceremony held at a chateau. Only a small group of guests attended with Maguire joined by his parents, Zoe and Alan, who travelled from their home near Sheffield. Maguire was seen in a white shirt and dark trousers, while Fern was pictured in an off-white jacket and trousers, as well as a pair of heels. When leaving the venue, she was seen in a huge ring.
