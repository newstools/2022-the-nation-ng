The Lagos Waste Management Authority (LAWMA) has arrested 65 persons at various locations around the state for environmental abuses. The Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, LAWMA, Mr Ibrahim Odumboni, said this in a statement yesterday in Lagos. Odumboni said the agency had renewed offensive against environmental abuses, adding that the renewed offensive would spare no offender, as tough times await environmental offenders for willfully abusing the environment.

For too long we have pleaded, but now is time to act. The new offensive is on autopilot and will spare no violator. “People must be made to pay for deliberately sabotaging their habitat. Many people have been picked up at different locations caught in the act, and will be prosecuted as a deterrent to other adamant persons,” he said.
