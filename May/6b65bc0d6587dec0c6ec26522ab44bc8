A social-political group, the Yoruba Ronu, has predicted failure of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in 2023 general elections if it fields a northern presidential candidate. The Yoruba Ronu said the plot by the PDP not to zone its presidential slot would boomerang at the polls. It said any southern candidates fielded by any political party would be massively voted for by Nigerians. The group stated the emergence of a southern presidency in 2023 should be considered sacrosanct for the continued unity of the nation. President of the group, Prince Diran Iyantan, in a statement in Akure, cautioned politicians promoting the concept of a ‘northern presidency’ in 2023 not to further polarise the country for more troubles than the ones at present. Iyantan wondered why political elites were deliberately promoting disunity as political weapon.

He urged politicians to focus on those positive areas pertinent to uniting Nigerians. According to him: “Everyone must ensure that what is passed across to the public are materials that enhance national peace, unity and development in view of the critical time the country is passing through at present. “Favourable unifying comments are what should be promoted in the media to ensure that tensions are not further exacerbated. “The only major factor to the sustenance of unity in the country is continual rotational presidency. The falsehood preached around that the ‘southern candidates do not have the numerical strength to win an election’ must be jettisoned for the unity of our dear motherland. “The PDP’s ploy to not, officially, zone the presidency to the Southern part of the country would, eventually, boomerang.”
