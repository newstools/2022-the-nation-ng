A former Vice-President and presidential aspirant of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, says the party cannot afford to remain in opposition after the 2023 presidential election. Atiku was in Port Harcourt, Rivers State on Saturday to seek votes from delegates ahead of the party primary. He called on members of the party to be united even if the forthcoming primary was not in favour of some aspirants. Atiku emphasised that the only way the party could wrest power from the APC, was to embrace unity. He promised the Rivers state delegates that he would run an all-inclusive government that would create a sense of belonging to all Nigerians. He said: “Whether in public or private, I will always protect the interest of Rivers people. If I am elected, I will bring all parts of this country together so that everybody can have that sense of belonging.   ‘APGA, victim of political kidnapping, brigandage’     Bayelsa delegates’ll support pro-restructuring…     Nasarawa APC adopt delegates from previous congresses   In his remarks, Senator Dino Melaye, called on the delegates not to waste their votes during the primary saying Atiku had the needed experience and capacity to wrestle power from the APC. Melaye who extolled the quality of infrastructural development by the Governor Nyesom Wike government, revealed that Atiku said Atiku had “eleven million votes in his pocket already” saying it would be unwise for delegates to vote for someone struggling for votes. The Chairman of PDP in Rivers state, Amb. Desmond Akawor, assured the presidential aspirant that the leadership of the PDP would decide on what was best for the party because the people were yearning for freedom. He added that the principle of zoning agreed by the leadership of the PDP must be upheld for the sake of fairness and equity.
