The Nigeria Union of Pensioners (NUP) has urged the Federal Government to stop governors from engaging contractors in the payment of pension. NUP said the Fed Government should deploy extant laws surrounding pensions to prevent governors from hiring contractors in pension payment. The National President, Godwin Ikechukwu, addressed reporters yesterday after the Southsouth/Southeast regional meeting of the NUP in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State. He lamented that pensioners in many states earn as low as N600, as against the N30,000 minimum wage. Ikechukwu, who blamed the governors for the cruelty against the senior citizens, said many contractors slash their pensions. He described the act as ‘disturbing and wickedness against the pensioners who have laboured for the nation for many years’.   ‘Zone presidential ticket to South’     Edo APC to members: resolve disputes with internal…     Workers hail Fed Govt’s funding of psychiatric…   He added: “Recently, governors who do not want to pay pension now created payment through contractors, and from there the contractors take their cut, leaving little or nothing for the pensioners. “We call on the Federal Government that is fully in charge of the payment of pension in Nigeria, under Section 1733 of the constitution, to stop payment of pension through contractors.” State Chairman Obong Ekpo lamented that the union in Akwa Ibom, for over 20 years, had been denied access to the governor to discuss issues pertaining to retirees. Ekpo said because of their meagre pension, majority have died of hunger and avoidable sicknesses. He praised forerunners of the pension scheme and its timely increase, but lamented that today’s generation lacks respect and care for aged people.
