Relegated Premier League club Watford have hired Rob Edwards as their new manager from the end of this season after his departure from fourth-tier champions Forest Green on Wednesday. Super Eagles’ quintet of William Troost-Ekong, Samuel Kalu, Maduka Okoye, Oghenekaro Etebo and Emmanuel Dennis are all on the payroll of the Hornets . Edwards will replace Roy Hodgson when the former England boss leaves Vicarage Road at the conclusion of their dismal campaign on May 22. Hodgson was on a short-term contract after arriving to succeed the sacked Claudio Ranieri and was unable to prolong Watford’s one-season stay in the top-flight. Watford’s relegation to the Championship was confirmed with a defeat at Crystal Palace last weekend.
