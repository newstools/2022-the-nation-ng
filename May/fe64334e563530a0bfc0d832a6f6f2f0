Popular Nigerian dancer, Korra Obidi has called out her estranged husband, Justin Dean for allegedly stealing her $5000. The money, according to Korra was mistakenly sent to their joint account after which Justin reportedly withdrew it. The displeased dancer gave her estranged husband 24 hours to respond. She laments: “Mistakenly, I sent money to my joint account with Justin Dean. I transferred $5000 there, he emptied the account and has downright stolen from me. “We’re separated and he has stolen from me and my girls. This is daylight robbery. I’ve messaged him to return this money he stole and he gave some excuses, trying to accuse me of stealing his gold.   Being with Don Jazzy was fun, says ex-wife     Veteran actor Oga Bello celebrates at 70     What I fear most in life, by Mr P   “I don’t know what’s he’s talking about but he just stole $5000 from I and my girls, we have lawyers fees to pay, rent at this point, but he wants us to be homeless. “He’s stealing from me at this point and he’s not giving me money for food for the girls, I’m taking care of these girls by myself and he’s still stealing from us. “I don’t want to be victimized and be treated like a horse that is working for a slave master, I’m just trying to build a home for my girls. I don’t want to be victimized because this money was made from my businesses and promotions. “Last warning, silence was golden, now it is over. You have 24hrs to respond” Few weeks ago, Justin Dean filed divorce accusing Korra Obidi of being narcissistic, cheating and lacks accountability.
