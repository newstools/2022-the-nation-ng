Milan escape an extremely nervy tie at San Siro with a 1-0 win, thanks to Leao’s tidy finish with just eight minutes left in the match. The Rossoneri came out of the half-time interval determined to find the breakthrough but a lack of clinical finishing and bad luck looked to conspire to condemn Pioli’s side to a lacklustre and disappointing draw.

The hosts would continue to suffer but finally managed to find what they needed after Terracciano’s poor kick allowed Leao to regain possession and drive forward before a cool finish from eight yards out beat the goalkeeper. The win puts Milan five points ahead of Inter, who kick-off shortly after the conclusion of this match. With the loss, Fiorentina stay seventh.
