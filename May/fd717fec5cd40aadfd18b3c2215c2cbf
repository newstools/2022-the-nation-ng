The Institute of Safety Professionals of Nigeria (ISPON), Lagos state branch, has made a case for the enactment of a National Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Management Act to ensure a safer work environment for workers. The organisation made the call while commemorating the 2022 World Day for Safety and Health at work. Chairman of the branch, Olusola Ogunleye, who spoke on the year’s theme, “Act together to build a positive culture of safety and health,” said that stakeholders should use social dialogue, participation and consultation as tools to build a positive safety culture.

He said effective social dialogue in the workplace has been shown to improve occupational safety and health management practices. “In the spirit of social dialogue and the huge potential it portends, authorities are encouraged to deepen engagement with relevant stakeholders in the private and public sector to revamp and enhance our current national realities in occupational safety and health,” he said.
