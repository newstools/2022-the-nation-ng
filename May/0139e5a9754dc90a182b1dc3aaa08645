The Senate has received the nomination of Senator Danjuma La’ah (Kaduna South) by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), as its new Deputy Minority Whip. La’ah’s nomination was contained in a letter to the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan read at the start of the plenary. The letter was signed by the National Secretary of the PDP, Senator Samuel Anyanwu. Anyanwu explained the nomination of Senator La’ah was against the backdrop of the recent defection of the former Minority Whip, Senator Ibrahim Danbaba (Sokoto South) to the majority All Progressives Congress (APC). The letter reads: “We wish to affirm the nomination of Senator Danjuma La’ah (Kaduna South) by the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) Senate Caucus, to fill the vacant seat of the Senate Minority Whip.

Two Senators – Emmnuel Bwacha and Ibrahim Danbaba – both of the opposition party and La’ah’s predecessors, resigned their membership of the PDP and defected to the APC. Ruling on Sekibo’s point of order, the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, ruled him out of order, saying that his observation was not in line with the provisions of Order 1(b) of the Senate Standing Orders, 2022 (as amended). He, however, urged the new Deputy Minority Whip to perform his functions to bring about stability and productivity to the Senate.
