Teenagers Coco Gauff and Leylah Fernandez claimed impressive wins to reach the French Open quarter-finals. Canada’s Fernandez made the last eight at Roland Garros for the first time with a battling victory over Amanda Anisimova. The 2021 US Open runner-up, 19, beat the American 6-3 4-6 6-3. Meanwhile, Gauff, 18, edged a tight first set against Elise Mertens before blowing the Belgian away in the second to triumph 6-4 6-0. The American progresses to the quarter-finals in Paris for the second successive year, equalling her best run at a Grand Slam, and will face either compatriot Sloane Stephens or Switzerland’s Jil Teichmann. “I just tell myself to fight for every point – pressure is a privilege and I used to focus too much on results but this Slam I am having the most fun that I ever have had at a tournament,” Gauff said in her on-court interview.

She will face Martina Trevisan for a semi-final spot following the unseeded Italian’s 7-6 (12-10) 7-5 win over Belarusian Aliaksandra Sasnovich. The 28-year-old Italian broke out into a broad smile at match point. “I know that it’s weird that I was smiling but you know it helped me a lot during the moment of [needing to have] more patience and [feeling] more nervous,” Trevisan said after making the quarter-finals at Roland Garros for the second time. “I remember to smile and I feel better. It’s not easy to do because the situation is very tough but I practise it a lot.”
