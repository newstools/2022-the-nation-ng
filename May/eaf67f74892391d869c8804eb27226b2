The event to be held at the Old Gymnasium of Obafemi Awolowo Stadium in Ibadan will feature seven professional bouts in different weight categories. “Kadima or whatever he’s called will not last. In three rounds, he’ll see double and begin to stagger because he would have been sufficiently beaten,” Emirate boasted yesterday in Lagos.
