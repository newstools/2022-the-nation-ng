The Bola Ahmed Asiwaju Tinubu Presidential Campaign Director, Abdulmumini Jibrin Kofa, yesterday accepted a reconciliatory move proposed by Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje of Kano State. Jibrin had a few days ago announced dumping the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to pitch tent with the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), following the crisis over the 2023 House of Representatives electoral battle for the Kiru/Bebeji Constituency seat. Governor Ganduje, not happy over the development, last Saturday directed the state secretariat of the APC to immediately take measures for amicable resolution of the internal differences arising from interested parties seeking nomination to contest election into the Kiru/Bebeji federal constituency. Thus, the party secretariat promptly complied and summoned a stakeholders meeting to discuss the matter in the constituency.
