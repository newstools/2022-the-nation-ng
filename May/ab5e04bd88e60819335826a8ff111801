Both Fabinho and Thiago Alcantara are expected to be fit to feature against Real Madrid, with Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp revealing it ‘looks good’ for his two star midfielders. There was growing optimism among supporters when both were pictured flying out to Paris earlier on Friday. Speaking in his final press conference before Saturday’s Champions League final at the Stade de France, Klopp was in good spirits when asked about the potential for the two injured midfielders to play. ‘We’re really excited about being here now and getting a feel for the stadium, the location and that is all good.   Real Madrid remains Europe’s most valuable club     LUIS DIAZ: From Colombia to C/League final     Klopp: We can’t buy Real Madrid’s experience   ‘[They] look good. Fabinho trained completely normal., Thiago will train today and we will go from there.’ Thiago headed to France as the bigger concern after he limped out of last Sunday’s final day win over Wolves. The Spaniard complained of an Achilles problem, casting doubt on his availability for the final against Real Madrid. Fabinho returned to training earlier this week having been forced to miss the final three games with a hamstring problem, picked up in a win away to Aston Villa.
