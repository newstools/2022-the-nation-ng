Jamie Vardy scored twice as Leicester thrashed already relegated Watford to consign them to a seventh defeat in eight Premier League games. The result boosts the Foxes hopes of a top-10 finish, with Watford, who have now lost 15 of their 19 home matches, dropping to the bottom of the table. With Roy Hodgson’s successor Rob Edwards paraded before kick-off, the afternoon had started brightly for the Hornets. Joao Pedro’s close-range effort deflected off Timothy Castagne to put them in front, and they had opportunities to extend their lead with Adam Masina hitting the crossbar and Brazilian forward Pedro seeing another effort well saved by Foxes goalkeeper Danny Ward.

Another misjudgement, this time from goalkeeper Ben Foster, saw Vardy beat him to the ball to head in Leicester’s second before Harvey Barnes guided Marc Albrighton’s cross into the bottom left corner 22 seconds after the break. While Pedro twice further seriously tested Ward, Watford’s dismal day saw Vardy race on to Barnes’ pass to prod the ball past Foster, before Barnes compounded their misery, sweeping a low effort past Foster into the bottom right corner late on.
