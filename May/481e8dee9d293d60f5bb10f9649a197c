Honestly, there were a lot of free throws that I left, that we left, a lot of silly turnovers that we had that could make it look a lot better. The fact that we were able to win this kind of game is amazing but we are not done yet at all. “I said it in February that we were going to play Tenerife in the final”, confessed Moneke with a smile. “I said it; I knew it and I’m just happy that it could happen.”
