Leaders of the All Progressives Congress(APC) in Ogun West Senatorial District have denied they were planning to foist Senator Solomon Olamilekan Adeola aka Yayi as the senatorial candidate on the APC for the 2023 National Assembly election. The party leaders also denied the accusation that they had been “bought” by Adeola to curry their support ahead of the party primaries, declaring that some those behind the allegations are opposed to the second term ambition of Governor Dapo Abiodun. A group, Committee of Concerned Ogun West Patriots under the umbrella of Ogun West Elders, Leaders and Stakeholders in the APC, in a communique, had accused the party leaders of working to tilt the senatorial primary in favour of Senator Adeola. The group also claimed the party in Ogun West was embroiled in controversy and acrimony, demanding that Senator Adeola be excluded from taking part in the primary on the presumption that he is a “stranger and foreigner.” But countering the allegations and those behind it while addressing a meeting of APC leaders and members of the Governor’s Elders Advisory Council at the weekend, the former Chairman of the Ogun State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) Muftau Ajibola, said that all the claims by the group led by Senator Iyabo Anisulowo and Mrs Mary Ogunjobi, were baseless and woefully failed attempt to discredit the genuine APC leaders in Ogun West. Ajibola added apart from the fact that the communique issued by the group was not signed, further findings revealed that leaders of the APC mentioned in the said communique, including Senators Ayo Otegbola, Kola Bajomo, Gbolahan Dada and others, were fraudulently inserted into the document without their knowledge or permission. He declared the real APC leaders and elders in Ogun West would not stand by and allow any qualified aspirant who can add value to the senatorial race to be excluded on the basis of personal animosity and hatred. “We make bold to say that Senator Solomon Olamilekan Adeola is one of our members in Ilaro Ward 1 of Yewa South local government. “As far as Yewa and Ogun West is concerned, he is not a foreigner or stranger. Besides, even an Ibo man or Hausa man who satisfies the provision of the constitution of Nigeria is qualified to run as a senatorial aspirant or candidate in Ogun West talk less of somebody who is a proven native of the land.

Ajibola flayed the members of the group for referring to themselves as the “genuine elders, leaders and stakeholders” of APC in Ogun West”, wondering “how can a meeting where not a single elected official of the party participated claim to be genuine or speaking for the party”? “The Ogun West APC has its elected executives with its recognised elders most of whom are members of the Governor’s Elders Advisory Council. Those who sat down on Wednesday 18th to issue the said communique do not belong to this category. Some of them are not even members of the APC. They should therefore be regarded as mere interlopers looking for underserved recognition. “We wish to observe that some of those being celebrated in the communique issued by the committee are people opposed to the aspiration of Governor Dapo Abiodun to run for a second term. As leaders in our senatorial district, we have prior to now endorsed the governor for a second term as a reward for the good work he is doing in our district in particular and the entire state in general. “We have always worked for the best to represent us in Ogun West; and in the 2023 elections, our position is that the best of the lot should fly our flag and represent us. Let nobody who has benefitted from such support in the past now rise against the house in an attempt to pull it down. We will strongly resist such unguided moves, and hereby warn such aspirants and others to retrace their steps otherwise, sooner or later they will meet their political waterloo”. He submitted. The meeting was attended by other APC leaders and stakeholders in Ogun West, including a former member of the House of Representatives, Bisiriyu Popoola; a former Deputy Governor, Mrs Salimot Badru; former Commissioner for Cooperatives and Community Development, Samuel Ayedogbon; former chairman, Ogun-Oshun River Basin Development Authority, Mrs Iyabo Apampa; former state chairman of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Olu Agemo and the chairman, House of Assembly Service Commission, Waliu Taiwo. The meeting was also attended by the APC senatorial chairman in Ogun West, Azeez Muhammed, senatorial Secretary, Bayo Oguntade, state officers of the party from Ogun West, local government chairmen as well as party chairmen in the five local government areas in the senatorial district.
