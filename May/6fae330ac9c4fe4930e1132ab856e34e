Amodu further revealed that only the top five finishers will benefit from the prize money on offer unlike in previous editions where the top eight finishers were captured. “We are sticking strictly with World Athletics standard as specified in the new road race regulations which came into force last November,” explained Amodu. “Nigerian athletes who finish in the top five in each gender category will share in both the prize money for the elite athletes and also that reserved for Nigerians.” The Okpekpe international 10km road race is the first road race in Nigeria nay West Africa to be granted a label status by World Athletics.
