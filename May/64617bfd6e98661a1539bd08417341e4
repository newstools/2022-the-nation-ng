Tina, wife of Dipo Okubanjo, ailing veteran journalist and Head, Media and Corporate Affairs Unit at Covenant University, has cried out over the worsening condition of her husband. Okubanjo was diagnosed with renal failure in 2021, and the condition has kept him out of work ever since. He is currently on weekly dialysis at the Gbagada General Hospital in Lagos. She said: “My husband has not had his dialysis for two weeks now because the family could not afford it. Ordinarily, he is supposed to do it twice a week, but because of the cost, we cut it down to once. He’s in pain and doesn’t sleep. Sometimes, he hallucinates and would not recognise where he is.  For two weeks he could not go for dialysis, it became worse, I had to call my uncle and friends who sent in help for him to go for us dialysis.”   Inside story of Uba Sani’s emergence as Kaduna APC…     2023: Money, godfatherism will play little or no role in…     A pastor’s N310,000 budget fare to heaven   Accordingly, her husband needs a kidney transplant quickly to save his life. The transplant will cost N20 million. “I’m calling on Nigerians to come to Dipo’s aid. He has not been going to work, though his employee Covenant University has been paying his salary, it is too little to cater to his needs. It can’t buy his drugs and supplements.” “It is impossible to raise the N20 million needed for the transplant while still battling to pay for dialysis. This is why I’m reaching out to good Nigerians to help with whatever token they can afford,” added the former PM News and Comets sports journalist.
