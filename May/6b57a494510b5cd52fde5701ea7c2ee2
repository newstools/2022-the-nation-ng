The ex-lover of actress Nkechi Blessing, Opeyemi Falegan, has publicly apologised to her. In a recent Instagram live video with Daddy Freeze, Falegan admitted it was partly his fault that the relationship fell apart. He said he still loves the movie star despite their messy public spat. Expressing himself in pidgin he said: “To my ex Nkechi, do not be offended. Let me use this opportunity to tell her that.   Ex-BBNaija Nini blasts troll over Saga     Suleman breaks silence on Otobo’s latest allegations     Genevieve deletes all posts, unfollows everyone on Instagram   “I know how it feels having shown a guy to the world and saying ‘ you are the love of my life, my husband’ and all of a sudden, the guy messed up. Don’t be offended in fact, if I could, I would have knelt down. “I needed to forge ahead. Maybe I didn’t do it in the best possible manner but I’m very, very sorry. “What we do at times does not define who we are. What defines it is how well we rise after falling. “And from my heart, Nkechi, from my heart I still love you. “(To daddy freeze) When you see her, tell her that I love her.”
