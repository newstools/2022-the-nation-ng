He said: “The Board, however, recommended a dividend of 22 kobo per ordinary shares to be paid out of the profit for the year, following the group’s profit after tax (PAT) of N4.4 billion compared to N5 billion in the previous year, representing a decline of 12.5 per cent. “The parent company also recorded a decline of 12 per cent in PAT over the preceding period. Hence, the PAT was N5billion in 2020 against N4.4billion in 2021. This, it said, is majorly due to sharp decrease in fair value gain.’’ The Group Managing Director/CEO, Tope Smart, appreciated  shareholders who have been supporting the company.
