Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare said the future of the sport of track and field is bright in Nigeria following another impressive display by the country’s athletes both at home and abroad. Johnson Nnamani, Egbuchilem Raphael Chimezie, Ezekiel Nathaniel, Favour Ofili, Rosemary Chukwuma, Alaba Akintola and Favour Ashe among others displayed standout performances at the 3rd AFN All Comers in Abuja and the Collegiate Circuit in the USA. “The performances by our athletes show the depth of talents we have in Nigeria. I am particularly pleased that majority of the athletes left Nigeria between 2020 and 2021 and their incredible rise to world class standards is a testimony that we have the talents here,” said the Sports Minister.

He ran a new personal best of 46.23s in Abuja. I was told he ran 46.9 seconds last year and first improved to ran 46.66s in Lagos last month. “This is a massive leap in performance, the kind our athletes are also displaying in the USA,” added the Minister.
