The 2023 senatorial battle in Anambra State is gradually taking shape, as the political heavyweights are set to square up against one another in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The kingmaker in the state, Chief Chris Uba, is set to deny the governorship candidate of the party during the November 6, 2021 election in the state, Mr. Valentine Ozigbo, the party’s ticket. Both of them from the South Senatorial Zone, alongside others in the other two zones, have been cleared by the party to vie for the ticket. Also, in the North, the former governorship candidate of the party and former chairman in the state, Dr. Tony Nwoye, will square up with former minister, Chief John Emeka and ex-Aviation Minister Stella Oduah.
