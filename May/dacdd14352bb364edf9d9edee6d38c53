Oyo State Government has directed all public primary schools to immediately implement the teaching of history as an independent subject starting from the current third term of the 2021/2022 academic session. The Executive Chairman, Oyo State Universal Basic Education Board, Dr. Nureni Adeniran, stated this on Monday while monitoring schools’ resumption in Ibadan. Adeniran, who applauded the massive turnout of pupils in public primary schools, said reintroduction of history is in line with the new education policy of the State Government. He applauded the leadership of Universal Basic Education Commission for the technical supports received as well as the supply of textbooks.

He hinted that the curriculum would enable pupils appreciate history as an instrument of national integration, adding that it would allow students know the history of the country. Adeniran, an education expert, who dazzled OYOSUBEB staff members and teachers by teaching pupils, said he was optimistic that the curriculum would equip the younger generations with the knowledge of the past. The OYOSUBEB boss said that the importance of history to nation building, patriotism and human development could not be over-emphasised.
