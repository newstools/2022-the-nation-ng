Vocalist Yinka Davies has urged parents to query their chidren’s source of income. The voice coach stated these in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos. She was addressing the surge in social vices and get-rich-quick syndrome among the youth. Davies, 51, also advised parents, especially mothers to properly scrutinise their children’s daily activities. More importantly, the media personality tasked parents to be worthy role models, laying good examples for the children to emulate.

So, we should be good role models to them.” She also noted while parents are actively involved in their children’s daily activities, these kids must not be shut down but given room to express themselves at every point. “We must be concerned about where our children go, how they speak and what they think of what they see, so it will inform us mothers and fathers where the children are heading to but we must always give them room to express themselves,” she added.
