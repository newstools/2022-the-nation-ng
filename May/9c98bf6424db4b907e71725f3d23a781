Arsenal missed out on Champions League qualification for a sixth successive season despite a comfortable win over Everton on the final day. The Gunners needed to defeat Frank Lampard’s side and hope Tottenham would lose at already relegated Norwich, but with Spurs winning 5-0 at Carrow Road theirs was a forlorn task. Mikel Arteta’s side took the lead midway through the first half as Gabriel Martinelli stroked home a penalty after his shot struck Alex Iwobi’s arm, with the spot-kick awarded after a video assistant referee check. Eddie Nketiah nodded in following a corner to extend the hosts’ lead after 31 minutes, before substitute Donny van de Beek, in what is likely to be his last game for Everton, side-footed in.

Both came from corners as Cedric Soares slotted in, then Gabriel poked in after Everton had initially cleared. Martin Odegaard added a late fifth as Arsenal finished in fifth place, two points behind Tottenham, but despite missing out on the top four, their fans were at least able to celebrate a return to the Europa League after missing out this season. Everton’s record-equalling 13th away defeat meant they finished four points clear of the relegation zone.  BBC
