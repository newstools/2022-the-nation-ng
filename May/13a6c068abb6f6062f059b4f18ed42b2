Investors in Nigerian equities closed weekend with net capital gains of N699 billion as share prices of several quoted companies rallied to their highest points in recent period. In three successive bullish days, aggregate market value of all quoted equities at the Nigerian Exchange (NGX) rose from its week’s opening value of N26.761 trillion to close weekend at N27.460 trillion, indicating net capital gains of N699 billion. The benchmark index for Nigerian equities, the All Share Index (ASI), indicated average gain of 2.61 per cent. This nudged the average year-to-date return to 19.24 per cent. The ASI, which had opened the week at 49,638.94 points, crossed another threshold to a new high at 50,935.03 points, its highest point since March 2008. Market pundits traditionally regard the 50,000 mark as a psychological threshold, a milestone for a bullish market. The sustained three-day rally came on the back of first quarter corporate earnings showing stable improvement in performance of several companies. Analysts agreed that the sustained rally was due to positive corporate earnings outlook as quoted companies defied macroeconomic constraints to post considerable first quarter results. Most quoted companies at the NGX were mandatorily required to submit their interim reports and accounts for the first quarter ended March 31, 2022 by April 30, 2022. Extant rules at the stock market require quote companies to submit their interim results not later than 30 days after the end of the quarter. Analysts at Afrinvest Securities said the extended bullish rally was “driven by investors’ positive reaction to the impressive first quarter2022 earnings”. Cordros Securities noted that the bullish momentum gained steam due to bargain hunting for blue-chip stocks, most of which delivered impressive growths.

Analysts at Cordros Securities noted that given that the first quarter 2022 earnings season has run its course with the upward repricing of cyclical stocks that ensued, the market may witness subdued performance in the days ahead. “The bears will likely dominate market performance, as investors cash out on the gains across bellwether stocks over the past two weeks. Notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings,” Cordros Securities stated.
