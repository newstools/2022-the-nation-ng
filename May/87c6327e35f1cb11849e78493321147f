The Architects Registration Council of Nigeria (ARCON) has directed architects to attend this year’s colloquium. It said apart from rejigging the programme to meet realities, the yearly event attracts 40 per cent grade points of the Continuous Professional Development Courses. ARCON President, Sir Dipo Ajayi, who noted that yearly the council works towards improving the content of the programme, added that the committee has expanded the scope of the event to cater for all categories of people in the profession. He said online and offline participants have a lot to gain from it.

He, therefore, urged those who have not been committed to the programme to turn in new leaf, as such defaulters might have difficulties in renewing their licence. Among others, Murnai said the event is, in part, ARCON’s commitment to advancing architectural practice, education and research for the public good and well-being, which would lead to the development of basic construction trade skills. Chairman, Planning Committee, Musa Sada, said participants would be exposed to technology in the AEC and job creation within the industry and the built environment. Sada, a former Minister of Mines and Steel, said the programme promised to make far-reaching impacts on architecture in the country. The chairman added that a lot of work had been done and more would still be done between now and May 23.
