The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board on Saturday announced the release of the 2022 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination results. Head, Public Affairs and Protocol, JAMB, Fabian Benjamin, said this in a statement on Saturday. The board directed candidates to send UTMERESULT to 55019 using the same phone number that was used for registration. The statement reads: “To check the 2022 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) result, all a candidate needs to do is to simply send UTMERESULT to 55019 using the same phone number that he/she had used for registration and the result would be returned as a text message. This is the only process of checking the 2022 UTME results for now as the Board has not uploaded it on its website for obvious reasons.   PEARL Awards set to host 25th edition     Adenuga, others, clinch National Productivity Awards     APC, PDP have lost touch with Nigerians, says NNPP Chairman   “In addition, candidates are forewarned that they would, as usual, receive all kinds of messages from desperate fraudsters on how to check their results different from the aforementioned one. Hence, the Board urges all candidates to ignore all such messages on how to check their 2022 UTME results as they are all products of deceit aimed at misleading them. “The Board, in line with its desire to adhere to the ease of doing business protocol of the government, has emplaced this user-friendly and simplified process of checking UTME results. “Furthermore, this simplified process would also serve to preclude the unconscionable exploitation of candidates by shylock business centres and cybercafés which often take advantage of hapless candidates. The 2022 UTME began on Friday, 6th May 2022 and ended on Friday 13th May 2022.”
