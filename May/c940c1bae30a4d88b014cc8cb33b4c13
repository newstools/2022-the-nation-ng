Ondo State Football Association says 20 teams will participate in the 2022 Ondo State FA Cup. Chairman of the Committee and organiser of the competition, Aderemi Adetula, said this on Tuesday in Akure during the draws for the preliminary stage of the competition. Adetula said the competition would start from the zonal level while the teams that qualified in the semifinal level would be in Akure. He said that instead of playing the knock out format that would make the teams not to have a feel of their money, a round rubbing format was decided to make the competition lively. A member of the committee and Chairman of Ondo State Referees Council, Fidelix Fabidun, said 20 was the highest number of teams in the state that had ever registered and participated in the competition.
