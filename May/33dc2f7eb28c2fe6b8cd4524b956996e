National Chairman of the New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP), Prof. Rufai Ahmed Alkali, says  the party has become the party to beat in the 2023 general election, saying both the APC and the PDP would have to under rate the party at their own risk. Alkali said in a statement welcoming former Kano State governor, Senator Ibrahim Shekarau, and former House of Representatives member, Abdulmuninin Jibrin to the party that with the mass movement to the party, the NNPP will soon become the first force. He said before now, the PDP was seen as the major opposition and threat to the APC ahead of the general election, stressing that the emergence of the NNPP has changed the political narratives across the country.   Former NDDC official, Turnah, jailed four years     Oil money not paid into FG account since January, says Obi     Labour institute wades into FG, ASUU stand-off   Senator Shekarau and Hon. Jibrin recently joined the NNPP from the All Progressives Congress (APC) despite efforts by Kano State governor, Dr Abdullahi Ganduje, to prevent them from leaving the ruling party. 17 members of Kano State House of Assembly as well as Ganduje’s Chief of Staff had earlier left the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the APC to team up with the NNPP Prof Alkali said the movement in Kano and other parts of the country  “are pointers to the fact the NNPP has become the party to beat not just in Kano State but all over the country. “Senator Ibrahim Shekarau’s movement to our party, as well as other movements in various parts of the country have now changed the permutations and political alignment in the country ahead of the 2023 general elections.”
