Taiwo Mati dumped two former champions to win his maiden laurel in the men’s singles at the ITTF Africa Western Region Championships as Fatimo Bello claimed her third consecutive title in the women’s singles of the competition. Mati, who finished fourth at the national trials organized by the Nigeria Table Tennis Federation (NTTF),edged 2019 champion Oba Oba Kizito of Cote d’Ivoire in the quarterfinal as well as his compatriot and 2021 champion, Rilwan Akanbi in the semifinal en route to the final where he defeated compatriot Azeez Solanke 4-1 (11-6, 7-11, 11-7, 12-10, 11-8) to emerge as the new regional champion. In the women’s singles, Bello continued her dominance with another victory over compatriot Bose Odusanya in the final. Unbeaten since 2019 when she won the maiden title in Abidjan, Bose showed her class when it mattered most with a 4-2 (11-6, 7-11, 11-7, 5-11, 11-5, 11-4) win over Odusanya.
