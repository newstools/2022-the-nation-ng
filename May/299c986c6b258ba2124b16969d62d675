The Chairman, Nigerian Institution of Estate Surveyors and Valuers (NIESV), Lagos State Branch, Mrs. Olabisi Demola-Alade, has advised estate surveyors and valuers to aspire to become associate members of the institution. She stated this at a media parley where she reeled out activities  to celebrate the Institution’s Week. According to her, since the NIESV leadership came on board last May, she had been working to realise her 10-point agenda to bring to the front burner, the critical role of estate surveyors and valuers in the built environment.   ‘Training vital to real estate investment’     LAWMA arrests 65 for abuses     LSDPC chief canvasses regional infrastructure devt policy…   She noted that her advocacy drive had taken her to some private organisations, including some tertiary institutions like the Yaba College of Technology (YABATAECH) to sensitise his colleagues on the advantage of becoming associate members. The NIESV chairman who scored herself high on the 10-point agenda she set for herself and members of the EXCO, noted with delight, that as she clocks one year in office this month, more associate members especially in ‘The very Branch’ as the Lagos branch is called, have been enrolled. According to her, the 2021/2022 Estate Surveyors and Valuers week is an avenue for members to ‘unwind’ and further ‘network’ with a view to expanding their scope of work and knowledge of the profession.
