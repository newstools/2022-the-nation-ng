South Africa head coach Desiree Ellis is anticipating a difficult group stage contest when her side square off against Nigeria in the 2022 TotalEnergies Women’s Africa Cup of Nations opening encounter in Rabat later in July. The seven-time COSAFA Champions were drawn against the nine-time African champions in the group stage for the fifth time at the draw held in Rabat on Friday, with first-time qualifiers Burundi and Botswana joining them in Group C.

Nigeria, the defending champions and multiple winners always bring their A-game and know what it takes to win,” Ellis told CAFOnline.com.”We have played them a few times in the group stages. They have raised their levels and we have to raise our levels even higher to get a positive result. The first game is the most important game and once again we need a positive result but it will take a huge effort. “Anything that has come before is history but it has shown us what we are capable of and has given us confidence and belief. As I said earlier we have played them many times in the group stages and this will be no different especially with this being an opening group match which is similar to 2018. “We will need a huge effort to get a positive result. The first game is the most important of any tournament and getting a positive result is very important but we know that it’s not going to be an easy game. Actually, it’s going to be a very difficult game.”
