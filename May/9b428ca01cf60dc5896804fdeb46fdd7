Former House of Representatives member Abiodun Akinlade yesterday described himself as the senatorial aspirant to beat in Ogun West District. The All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain called for an issue-based campaign, instead of focusing on the financial muscles of contenders. Akinlade, Deputy Director-General of Dapo Abiodun Campaign Organisation in 2019 and until recently, member of the Federal Character Commission, spoke with reporters in Lagos about his ambition. He said the majority of constituents were rooting for his candidature in recognition of his past legislative activities and people-oriented projects in Yewaland. Akinlade said: “When I was in the House of Representatives, I discovered that my people in Ogun West lacked many amenities. I left in 2015. My successors have not been able to match my feat. If I am a senator, I will be able to cover wider areas.” The aspirant said he never knew he would contest for the Senate when he facilitated projects in many places outside his constituency.

He acknowledged the presence of Senator Olamilekan Adeola in the senatorial race, boasting “he cannot beat me.” Akinlade said: “He (Adeola) should show his scorecard, his record of achievement. We are not poor in Ogun West. Nobody can buy us. What people are looking for is Akinlade. We true sons of the soil in this race know ourselves.” The aspirant alleged that “people from outside are coming to Ogun West to disrupt the peace of the district.” However, he alluded to the God factor, saying: “It depends on what God has ordained.” Akinlade urged the people of Ogun State to vote for the re-election of Governor Dapo Abiodun, saying he had performed.
