Sprinters Favour Ofili, Rosemary Chukwuma and Favour Ashe headlined another weekend of impressive displays by Nigerian collegiate athletes in the USA following their efforts in the 100m and 200m events. Ofili ran a blistering 10.93s in the 100m event on Saturday at the LSU Invitational at Bernie Moore Track Stadium to win the event and move up to No. 8 on the all-time collegiate list. The 19-year-old, who already owns the collegiate record in the 200m bursts out of the blocks on the way to set a wind-legal personal best of 10.93s in the event to win the title. Favour Ashe was also devastating on the track as he ran 9.79s with a 3.0 m/s tailwind. It is the fifth-fastest all-conditions time in collegiate history in the men’s 100m. Meanwhile, reigning World U20 champion in the 400m, Imaobong Nse Uko ran 51.66s, the second best 400m time of her career to place third behind Kendall Ellis (51.00s) and Rosey Effiong (51.66s), daughter of former Nigeria speed king, Daniel Effiong.

Chinecherem Prosper Nnamdi threw 73.06m to win the javelin event at the meet. Focus had been on the 19-year-old to finally break the Nigeria record of 81.08m set by Pius Bazighe in 1999. Nnamdi was just a centimetre outside the mark when he threw 81.07m at the Michael Johnson Invitational just last weekend. At the Corky/Crofoot Shootout meet at the Fuller Track and Field Complex in Lubbock, Texas, Chukwuma was also in inspiring form. The 20-year-old legally dipped inside 23 seconds for the first time in her career to win the 200m race at the event and set a new Texas Tech University record.
