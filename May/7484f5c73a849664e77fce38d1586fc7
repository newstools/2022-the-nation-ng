The Dangote Petroleum Refinery is built to meet the new Euro-5 Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) petrol standard, The Nation learnt yesterday. This is contained in the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) obtained by our correspondent yesterday. The Euro-5 standard is meant to reduce carbon emissions.  The new Euro-5 limits reduce pollution from the exhaust and are remarkably similar to Euro-6 limits for cars. Euro-5 is mandatory for all new type-approved motorcycles, including mopeds, with exceptions for some small market categories such as trial bikes.

It should also be noted that the Dangote Refinery is designed and built to meet Euro 5 classification standards which will meet local, regional and international standards. “Also, the output of other modular refineries are expected to meet Euro 4 specifications at a minimum.”
