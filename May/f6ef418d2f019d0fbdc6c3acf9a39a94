Popular skit maker Adebowale Adedayo aka Mr Macaroni has attempted to offer reasons into why government is less concerned about the plight of students. According to him, the government cannot relate with the agony from the prolonged strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), causing sleepless nights among parents and students in the higher institutions because their children school abroad. He made this known on Tuesday in a tweet.

Our Leaders cannot relate to the pain and sadness that this brings to Parents who simply want good Education for their children”, “Our leaders can’t relate because their own children school in The U.S.A, U.K or some other fancy school abroad.” ASUU commenced its ongoing strike on February 14, 2022 after the Federal Government failed to meet some of its demands, including the release of revitalisation funds for universities, renegotiation of the 2009 FGN/ASUU agreement, release of earned allowances for university lecturers, and deployment of the University Transparency and Accountability Solution payment platform.
