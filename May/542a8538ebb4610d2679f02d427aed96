Justifying the need for the training, “We have no tolerance for carelessness because human lives are involved”, he stated. “We retrain them regularly because, over time, there might be the temptation for some to try to take things of safety for granted. But we don’t allow that, so, despite the logistics implications, we do these training regularly.” Expectedly, Igwegbe specifically helps verify the drivers as well as ensures they have the valid driving licences among other certification as stipulated by the law. FRSC officers take them through safety routines like fire emergency reactions, highway codes, and general road safety procedures. The Safety Manager Igwegbe expressed satisfaction with drivers’ response to the current session, assuring that the company was not about to lower its high safety standards to accommodate any recalcitrant driver.
