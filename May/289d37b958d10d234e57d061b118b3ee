Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) elders and leaders in Abia State yesterday warned that implosion was imminent in the chapter, unless the national leadership moved to pull it back from the brink. They said an individual had sworn to produce the next governor and three senators, adding that he had put the entire party in his pocket. They complained that although the majority of party faithful were waiting for the national chairman and secretary of PDP to reschedule the congresses and inform the electoral commission, an individual and his acolytes simply wrote a list of ad hoc delegates across the 184 wards.
