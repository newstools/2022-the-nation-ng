Akwa Ibom State Governor Udom Emmanuel has vowed to make the best of the opportunity available as he moves to the next phase of his political career. Uppermost on his agenda is good governance and proper opportunities for all. Over the years, his target has always been laying good footprints on the sands of time. Little wonder he obeyed the clarion call of his people and resigned as Secretary to the State Government to contest the governorship election of 2015, which he won overwhelmingly under the flagship of the People’s Democratic Party.

He launched a moral rebirth and self-motivation initiative, the dakkada campaign, urging Akwa Ibomites to rise to the faith of greatness and ask the people of Nigeria to key into such a laudable project. Governor Emmanuel is contesting for the presidency in 2023 under the flagship of the PDP not just to contest but to make Nigeria a habitable country for all and a tourist-attractive nation. In view of the mandate of the Emmanuel-led administration to consolidate on the gains of uncommon transformation witnessed across Akwa Ibom state today and his commitments to completely industrialise the state is a fact that this will be achieved in the centre. As regards infrastructural consolidation and expansion, the Emmanuel Udom administration has delivered on its promises.
