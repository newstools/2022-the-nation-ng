Captain Sierra Leone Steven Caulker, said qualifying for the 2023 African Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Cote d’Ivoire will be a difficult task, especially with his side in the same group as the Super Eagles of Nigeria. The former Liverpool and Tottenham centre-back, who made his international debut for the Leone Stars in the 0-0 match against Algeria at the 2021 AFCON in Cameroon earlier in the year, admitted that there is no easy match in African football. The Leone Stars will open the qualifiers against three-time African champions Nigeria, whom they drew two times (4-4 and 0-0) in the qualifiers for the 2021 AFCON. After Nigeria, Sierra Leone will host Guinea Bissau in the Guinean capital a few days later.

I am really delighted to be able to lead this group in qualifying,” the central defender told Cafonline.com. “Our qualifying group is going to be tough, obviously Nigeria will be looking to bounce back from their disappointment following their elimination to Ghana in the 2022 World Cup. “We have to be at our best for every game and against Nigeria is an opportunity to put Sierra Leone on the world football map. I’m sure like we did in the last AFCON, we have to be at our best for all games, not just against Nigeria, we should go into every game with the ambition to win it,” he added.
