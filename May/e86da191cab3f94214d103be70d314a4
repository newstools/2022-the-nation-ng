Nigerian wing-back Victor Moses scored one and assisted another to power Spartak Moscow to a fine 3-1 win over Ural at the Ekaterinburg Arena in the Russian Premier League. A mid-season slump had condemned Spartak to a mediocre campaign with a finish in the European places out of their reach. But Paolo Vanoli’s men made the trip to Ekaterinburg on the back of two wins in their last three matches and made it three victories in four thanks to two moments of brilliance from their Nigerian import.   Ighalo brilliant as Al Hilal beat Damak     Osimhen impressive as Napoli beat Torino     Liverpool drop vital points in title race   Ex-Chelsea and Inter Milan man Moses set up Jamaican striker Shamar Nicholson in the 26th minute to double the advantage for the People’s Team after the same player had given the visitors an 11th-minute lead. The former Super Eagles forward made it three-nil for Spartak at the half-hour mark as the Gladiators went into the break with a healthy advantage. Goglichidze struck one back for the home side, but Spartak held on to seal their seventh win of the season.
