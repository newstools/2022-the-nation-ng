Why residents want me re-elected, by Oyetola     ‘Ibadan deserves special status’     I will not take my unopposed ticket for granted, says…   Speaking about the development, the Director of Media to Babayemi, Kayode Oladepo, confirmed that the reconciliation committee was for delegates and was not connected with issues surrounding the authentic candidate of the party for the 2022 Osun governorship poll. He said: “The meeting was held at the instance of the Reconciliation Committee. The two groups agreed on the national delegates. “They came for reconciliation of the party as a whole, not that for the governorship matter. The committee met with the two factions over the presidential primary. There are delegate elections coming up on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday for the presidential primary. “They agreed on the national delegates. The two groups divided the Osun slots. Instead of going for primary, they have both agreed.” He added that the court would decide on the Osun State governorship primary.
