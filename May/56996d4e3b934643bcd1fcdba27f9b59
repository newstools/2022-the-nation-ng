Last Thursday, Kola Abiola, eldest son of the late Chief Moshood Abiola, acclaimed winner of the June 12, 1993 presidential election, picked the N10million People’s Redemption Party’s (PRP’s) expression of interest and nomination forms for next year’s presidential election. With that, he made good his promise to run for office. With that move also, he confirmed fears that the household of the late M.K.O. may become divided by the incursion of the politician’s children into partisan politics. A few weeks ago, Hafsat Abiola-Costello, daughter of the late business mogul, and a younger sister to Kola, was named the Director-General of the Governor Yahaya Bello Presidential Campaign Organization. The Kogi State governor is a presidential aspirant on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).   2023: Mustapha, others dump Amosun camp, join Abiodun     Drama as Police carry detained Rep Dagogo to court on…     PDP’s decision on zoning sacrosanct, says Diri   While receiving his forms from the National Secretary of the party, Mr. Babatunde Alli, at the PRP’s headquarters in Abuja, Kola reiterated his earlier stand that APC has failed to meet the yearnings of Nigerians, promising to help the PRP send the party out of government in 2023. But his younger sister, Hafsat, who prides herself as the first female DG of a presidential campaign organisation in the country, is not leaving anybody in doubt about her commitment to her assignment and her new political party. Sentry heard some observers wondering how the current development will affect the late Abiola’s family, especially after tempers rose when Hafsat likened Bello to her late father and was tongue-lashed by Tundun Abiola, another of her siblings for daring to compare her new boss with the late politician. Now that Kola and Hafsat will be mounting podiums on opposing sides to canvass for support, what more will politics do to the Abiola family? Time will surely tell.
