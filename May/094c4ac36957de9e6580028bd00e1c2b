A presidential aspirant of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mr. Peter Obi, has said that no single dollar had been paid into Federal Government’s account since January despite the rise in crude oil price at the international market. Obi stated this on Friday during an interactive session with a PDP youth group, in continuation of his consultations ahead of the party’s presidential primaries. The aspirant lamented the parlous security and economic situation in the country urging Nigerians to immediately rescue  the nation before it collapses. Obi said: “Every day in Nigeria, you hear bad news. We can no longer pretend. Nigeria is no longer a destination for investors.

The youth must change the future of Nigeria. Nigeria is collapsing and it is happening fast. “It may not be too long before it will completely collapse. Tension and unrest still persist and we should be worried. Nigeria is one of the most stressful countries to live in today.” Obi’s campaign coordinator, Dr. Doyin Okupe, alleged moves by some interests to frustrate Obi’s chances of winning the PDP ticket.
