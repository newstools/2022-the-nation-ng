Tech entrepreneur, Akinola Abdulakeem, has said lack of infrastructure, unstable power and insecurity impede growth of technology. Abdulakeem, who spoke at the weekend, said: “…take Lagos, for example. There is no proper infrastructure that can drive an enthusiast into the tech space, no stable electricity, mobile data is expensive and almost unaffordable. “There is civil unrest hampering development and given rise to unfavourable policies that may have helped fix the problem. We can’t ignore insecurity as well.

This issue does not only affect persons in tech, but everyone else.” Abdulakeem listed solutions to transform the tech space and overcome barriers. “The right mix, support, appropriate leaders, and infrastructure will address these challenges. I wish leaders would pay attention to youths. Technology is the new oil, and making a small shift to provide support and resources will foster ideas and businesses to contribute to growth and the country’s tech space.” Over 12,000 Nigerian students have benefited from the entrepreneur’s tech scholarship programme, which he runs through his UK and Pan-African software business, ‘aptLearn’.
