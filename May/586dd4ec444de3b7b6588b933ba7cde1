Popular Digital Marketer and PR Strategist Adegoke Pamilerin aka as Pam Pam, has explained why he opened LaCibo and Flames restaurants in Surulere, Lagos. According to him, he decided to try new things because influencing has become a routine that should be juxtaposed with another hustle. Speaking in Lagos, Pamilerin explained that the topmost on his agenda is providing a befitting date restaurant for Lagosians in Surulere and its metropolis. He also revealed that his friend, Stephen Kohams was the Alpha of LaCibo and Flames restaurants. Stephen Kohams spearheaded the idea of LaCibo and Flames, which is now one of the leading restaurants in Lagos. “I was already looking for what to invest in or something new to try. So, when my partner, Stephen Kobams, approached me to say that he had plans for Lacibo and felt like we could do it together, I jumped into it.

The business partners went ahead to launch Flames by Lacibo in April 2022, a luxury restaurant that is befitting for dates on the Mainland part of Lagos. Pamilerin said he was honed to setting up Flames coupled with the lack of decent dining restaurants in Surulere. “We launched Flames because there isn’t a proper fine dining restaurant in Surulere. Flames is the first fine dining restaurant in Surulere. We are saving people the stress of having to go to the Island for proper dates,” he added. Pamilerin came to the limelight as Omo Iya Ologi after exiting Black House Media (BHM), Nigeria’s leading marketing communication company, founded by Ayeni Adekunle Samuel. Pamilerin revealed that Ayeni had encouraged him to take up a challenging task rather than the PR job that has become a norm and is no longer challenging.
