Justice Abiola Soladoye of an Ikeja Domestic Violence and Sexual Offences Court yesterday sentenced a dismissed policeman, Mohammed Alidu, to life imprisonment for defiling a nine-year-old schoolgirl. Delivering judgment in the matter, Justice Soladoye held that the prosecution has  proved the offence of child defilement against the convict  beyond reasonable doubt. The judge described the convict as a disgrace to the Nigeria Police Force. According to her, the convict failed to uphold the law  and went about frolicking with an underage girl. She said the survivors’ evidence was fully corroborated by the  medical evidence. “The evidence of the survivor is the most credible evidence in identifying the perpetrator.   ‘Cart pushers a security risk’     ‘Adopt people-centred approach to tackling…     DSS gets court’s nod to detain terror suspect for 60…   “The vivid and oral testimony of the survivor  satisfied the court that the prosecution has proved every inch of the ingredients.” Justice Soladoye sentenced the convict to life imprisonment. “The defendant should have his name entered in the Sex Offenders Register of the Lagos State Government,” the judge held. An Ondo Chief Magistrate Court also sentenced one Stephanus Stephen to 12 years imprisonment for raping a 15-year-old girl. Stephen, 20, was said to have forcibly defiled the victim at her father’s house in Ondo. The convict pleaded guilty. In her narration, the victim said, “I was asleep in my family’s living room when Stephen came to meet me and started touching me, I was scared. So, I started shouting, but nobody was around. It was just myself and him in the house. He forced himself on me and raped me.” Presiding magistrate, Mrs Charity Adeyanju, sentenced him to 12 months imprisonment without an option of a fine.
