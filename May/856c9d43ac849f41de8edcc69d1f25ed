An association, the Osogbo Progressives Union (OPU), has raised the alarm that disgruntled indigenes have sold 364 lock-up shops out of the 400 belonging to the community, to individuals. The National President, Kamorudeen Makinde, who addressed reporters yesterday at the Osogbo City Hall, ahead of the union’s general meeting, said the executives of the association were elected on December 28, 2021, but some disgruntled indigenes were frustrating the development of the community. He said: “We have 400 lock-up shops built by the community, but it is unfortunate that some disgruntled members of the union, who lost the election last year, conspired and sold off 364 shops and other property to individuals. This is unfortunate. They have sold the fortune of our children.”   Cleric to Nigerians: pray a man after God’s heart will…     Ondo to curb gender-based violence in tertiary institutions     Ekiti landlords protest N82.6m unpaid compensation   Makinde said the disgruntled indigenes had begun sinister moves to frustrate the meeting of the union slated for tomorrow by causing violence. ”The recent legal step taken by the executives, which exposed how some individuals sold the property of the town, is making the affected indigenes to regroup to frustrate the planned meeting, which will further energise the association in its determination to ensure that the looted property of the Osogbo Progressive Union are recovered and unprecedented development achieved for Osogbo,” he said. Makinde urged Osogbo indigenes to remain calm and law-abiding, saying anybody caught truncating peace would face the wrath of the law.
