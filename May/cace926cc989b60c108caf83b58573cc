Super Eagles defender Calvin Bassey has been mentioned as a potential transfer interest at Bayern Munich and Chelsea after a solid season in Scotland, according to Fichajes.

He has also been linked with a transfer to Aston Villa where he may be rejoining his former coach and the man who gave him his professional bow, Steven Gerrard. He is one of the most talked-about young defenders in Europe at the moment, especially on the back of excellent performance in the final of the Europa League against Eintracht Frankfurt.
