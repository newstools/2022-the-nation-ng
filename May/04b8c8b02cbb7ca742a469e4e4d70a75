Ogun West Senator Tolu Odebiyi has called on his constituents to be vigilant and ensure that no political intruders are allowed to hoodwink them in any manner. Odebiyi, who was fielding questions from newsmen in Abuja, told them to reject political intruders and strangers who want to reap where they did not sow. He said such politicians do not have the interest of the people at heart but see the people as purchasable commodities that would be discarded once their political objective is attained. Odebiy noted that the people of Ogun West know those who have served their cause well and deserve their support and encouragement. According to him: “In Ogun West, we remain steadfast and vigilant. Our people know those who have served them well. I have no doubt that they will continue to stand firm as we move forward together in developing the area.”   ‘Tinubu presidency will create jobs, promote unity,…     Who will PDP pick as flag bearer?     2023: Atiku promises to restructure Nigeria   Odebiyi expressed implicit confidence in the people of Ogun West, stating that they are supportive of his leadership because of the numerous dividends of democracy which they have continued to enjoy under his stewardship in the National Assembly.
