The Pole, 33, has scored 343 times in 373 games for Bayern – their second-highest scorer of all time behind Gerd Muller since arriving in 2014. “He informed me that he does not want to accept our offer to extend the contract and that we would like to leave,” Salihamidzic told Sky Germany.

However, Salihamidzic suggested the striker, also the second-highest goalscorer in Bundesliga history behind Muller and winner of the past two Fifa men’s player of the year awards, would not be allowed to leave. “Our position has not changed,” he said. “The fact is he has a contract to 30 June 2023.”
