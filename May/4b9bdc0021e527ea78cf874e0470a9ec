Nollywood Actress Ini Edo yesterday joined Civil Society Organisations and other stakeholders in Ekiti State on a Stop Violence against Women (Stop VAWIP) campaign. The campaign was organised by the Balm in Gilead Foundation for Sustainable Development (BIGIF), in conjunction with the New Generation Girls and Women Development Initiative (NIGWAD). Edo, who is Stop-VAWIP ambassador, appealed to the political parties and their followers to shun violence before, during and after the June 18 election. She encouraged party candidates to take a stand against hate speech, provocative campaign, electoral violence, vote-buying and other forms of violence, saying election should not be a do-or-die affair. She added: “Candidates should promote public intolerance of violence targeted at politically-active women and ensure their free participation in party functions and structures, and support women voters’ mobilisation.

Shun electoral violence and be peaceful in carrying out your political activities. Don’t engage in activities capable of setting the state on fire.” Executive Director of BIGIF, Tumininu Adedeji said her organisation will partner the National Orientation Agency (NOA) to enlighten the people on what constitutes violence against women in politics. She worried that most women are discouraged from participating in politics because of electoral violence. Adedeji called on the political parties to eschew abusive language during the campaign, and urged them to make the state a reference point in the country for holding peaceful poll. The NIGWAD Chief Executive Officer, Mrs. Abimbola Aladejare-Salako, said women deserved to be given special preference and protected against all categories of violence which could demoralise them in taking active part in politics.
