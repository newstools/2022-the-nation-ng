A Coalition in All Progressives Congress (APC) in Southwest has warned President Muhammadu Buhari against breaching the trust and agreement with Southwest leaders prior to his election in 2015. A statement by National Convener Fatai Adekunle said Buhari is morally bound to ensure a member from Southwest succeeds him. He said: “We are appealing to President Muhammadu Buhari to reciprocate the gesture of Southwest towards him in 2015 by making sure one of its sons succeed him in 2023 as appreciation for the gesture of our people to him. “We are witnesses to the roles played by Southwest in 2015. It is no gainsaying that without the alliance between Southwest and North, Buhari presidency would not have been possible. “This happened at a time Buhari had lost hope of becoming president.” It urged the President to call his men working against Southwest to order, saying their antics cast doubt on the integrity of Buhari.

This, to us, will amount to betrayal…” The group cautioned party leaders on rumours of attempts to breach the constitution to foist former President Goodluck Jonathan as its candidate. Adekunle said it will be difficult for members to campaign for a candidate they worked against in 2015 because ‘Nigerians will see us as unserious and unstable’. Describing Jonathan as an outsider in APC, Adekunle said it would be ‘morally wrong for the party to contemplate fielding him as its flag bearer next year’. “Ordinarily, no one will begrudge anyone who desires to exercise his right to aspire to a political office, but actions, they say, generate reactions and this is what Jonathan’s rumoured bid has generated,” he said.
