This shows output growth of 3.11 per cent in the first quarter of 2022.

Resultantly, the Oil GDP grew by -26.04 per cent in the first quarter of 2022 and accounted for 6.63 per cent of total output during the reference quarter. “The non-oil sector grew by 6.08 per cent in real terms during the reference quarter (first quarter 2022). This rate was higher by 5.28 per cent points compared to the rate recorded same quarter of 2021 and 1.34 per cent points higher than the fourth quarter of 2021. “This sector in the first quarter of 2022 was mainly driven by activities in the Information and Communication (Telecommunication); Trade; Financial and Insurance (Financial Institutions); Agriculture (Crop Production); and Manufacturing (Food, Beverage & Tobacco), all accounting for positive GDP growth. In real terms, the non-Oil sector contributed 93.37 per cent to the nation’s GDP in the first quarter of 2022, higher than the share recorded in the first quarter of 2021 which was 90.75 per cent, and lower than the fourth quarter of 2021 record at 94.81 per cent,” he said. “Fastest growing activities in the first quarter of 2022. Financial and Insurance sectors, Water Supply, Sewage, Waste Management & Remediation sector, Information and Communication sector, Trade sector, and Human Health & Social Services sector showed strong growth figures during the first quarter of 2022.”       “Thus, the fastest-growing activities in real terms during the first quarter of 2022 were Rail Transport & Pipelines (124.54 per cent); Air Transport (50.68 per cent); Metal Ores (30.76 per cent); Financial Institutions (25.43 per cent); “Telecommunications & Information Services (14.50 per cent); Chemical and Pharmaceutical Products (10.33 per cent); Food, Beverages, and Tobacco (9.81 per cent); and Cement (9.57 per cent). “However, some of the slowest growing activities include Oil Refining (-44.26 per cent); Crude Petroleum and Natural Gas (-26.04 per cent); Road Transport (-24.63 per cent); Quarrying and Other Minerals (-13.72 per cent); Coal Mining (-12.97 per cent); Electrical and Electronics (-4.87 per cent), among others. “Rail and Air transport activities witnessed high demand in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the corresponding quarter of 2021, as they are known to provide alternative modes of transportation considered to be safer, in addition to the easing travel restrictions. “The growth recorded in Metal Ores was driven principally by the increase in the volume of production during the quarter. Again, there was an improvement in the performance of Water Supply, Sewerage, Waste Management, and Remediation activities during the quarter as a result of an increased volume of water processing and waste collection. On the other hand, the poor performance of oil was occasioned by operational challenges such as vandalism of pipelines and oil theft. “On the broad sectoral performance, Agriculture grew by 3.16 per cent during the first quarter of 2022 in real terms, higher than the first quarter of 2021 which recorded 2.28 per cent. The industry, grew by -6.81 per cent, which is a decline over the figure recorded in the first quarter of 2021 when it recorded a growth of 0.94 per cent. The Services sector grew by 7.45 per cent, an improvement from -0.39 per cent reported in the first quarter of 2021. “In conclusion, I must not forget to say a word of appreciation to our partners in the statistical system for their consistent and unwavering support. “In particular, I wish to thank the media for the important role it continues to play in informing the general public, as well as its continued support for NBS’s data dissemination policy. There is no doubt that the support provided has helped tremendously to improve statistical delivery and usage in Nigeria.”     “In the same vein, I look forward to a credible reporting on the first quarter GDP, 2022 in both electronic and print media, as well as all social media platforms. As usual, NBS remains open to providing further information and clarifications on this important statistical product” reads the statement in parts.”
