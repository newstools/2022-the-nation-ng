Maduka Okoye’s performance in Sparta Rotterdam’s last three Eredivisie games has been celebrated by Watford as the Super Eagles goalkeeper kept a clean sheet for the Dutch side in their escape from relegation. In a statement on Watford’s website, Okoye will be among the Watford players that will bid farewell to their temporary clubs, as the domestic campaigns come to a close across Europe. Okoye is among the individual that saved their teams from going down the elite league in their various clubs.

Sparta had won five games all season and sat bottom of the table going into a final flurry of fixtures, but collected 10 points from 12 to rise to 14th in the league, one point ahead of Heracles, who were beaten 3-1 by Okoye’s side on the final day and now face a relegation play-off. Okoye’s clean sheet in a 2-0 win over PEC Zwolle last week played a major role in the club’s survival, with confirmation of their spot in the first division in a dramatic fashion. The Nigeria international, Watford-bound after agreeing to a deal to join the club from next season, said an emotional goodbye to the club that signed him in 2020.
