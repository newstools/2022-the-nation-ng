Tottenham kept their Champions League hopes alive with a thumping 3-0 north London derby win over Arsenal. Victory for the Gunners in one of the biggest, most highly anticipated and potentially most consequential North London Derby in more than a decade would have sealed their place in the top-four of the Premier League, but Spurs enjoyed a night to remember. Harry Kane scored either side of Rob Holding’s second yellow card in the first-half as the hosts took complete control heading into the break.Heung-min Son added a third for his side shortly after the restart, and Spurs coasted through the rest of the match to move just a point behind the Gunners going into the final two matches of the season.

Dejan Kulusevski swung a cross in, where Heung-min Son was shoved in the back by Cedric Soares and the referee pointed to the spot. Kane was never likely to miss. Soon after the goal, Holding was shown his first yellow card after making a third foul on Son as he continued to get too tight to the Spurs man. Another yellow and a red followed seven minutes later as Holding raised his arm to block Son’s run and the centre-back could have no complaints as he was given his marching orders. Kane scored yet another goal against the Gunners before the break, getting on the end of Rodrigo Bentancur’s flick-on from a corner to convert from close range at the back post.
