No fewer than 65 persons have been arrested at various locations around the state by the Lagos Waste Management Authority (LAWMA) for environmental abuses. Its Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Ibrahim Odumboni, made this known in his office at Ijora. He said tough time awaited offenders for abusing the environment. He noted that, for too long, LAWMA had advised the public not to deface the city.

For too long, we have pleaded, now is time to act. The new offensive is on auto pilot and would spare no violator. People must be made to pay for deliberately sabotaging their habitat. Many people have been picked up at different locations caught in the act, and will be prosecuted as a deterrent to other adamant persons. “Indiscriminate waste disposal has serious consequences on the environment, such as blockage of drainage channels, canals, defacing of environment, and spreading of infectious diseases.’’ The LAWMA chief reiterated the authority’s commitment to cleaning  every part of the state, urging residents to imbibe the culture of proper waste disposal. Odumboni said his agency was working with the Neighbourhood Watch and the Motor Vehicle Administration Agency (MVAA) for  effective human and camera surveillance, to track and apprehend persons and motorists engaging in waste migration around the city. He renewed his appeal for standard and civilised environmental habits, for the common good of all.
