Striker Erling Haaland scored and was given an emotional goodbye in his final match for Borussia Dortmund. Haaland, who is set to join Manchester City this summer, scored a penalty in Dortmund’s 2-1 win over Hertha Berlin. Before the game, Dortmund’s last match of the season, there was a ceremony to mark the Norwegian’s departure with the Dortmund fans chanting his name. He will leave having scored 86 goals in 89 games since joining Red Bull Salzburg in January 2020.

His penalty equalised after Ishak Belfodil’s spot-kick put Hertha ahead before 17-year-old Youssoufa Moukoko struck with a winner in the 84th minute.
