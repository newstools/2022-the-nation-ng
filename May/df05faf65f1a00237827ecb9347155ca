Divisional Head, Retail, SME Banking and E-Business, Unity Bank Plc, Olufunwa Akinmade has explained that the bank’s latest retail product called Yanga is aimed at empowering the underbanked women entrepreneurs in Nigeria. Akinmade, who stated this during a chat with reporters, cited a recent EFInA report, saying: “There are 51 million Nigerian women above 18 years, with over 41 per cent of the unbanked. Out of these figures, it is estimated that there are 14-18 million female entrepreneurs – mainly in the micro SME category”. The bank had launched the women-focused Yanga account last November to promote financial inclusion and cater to unbanked women entrepreneurs across Nigeria in the MSME space. Therefore, the new retail product is designed to deepen its beneficial impact on Micro Small and Medium Enterprises, MSMEs operated by women in the mass-market retail space. According to Akinmade, “Recent research has shown that Nigeria has the highest number of women entrepreneurs in the world, with an estimated 40 million SMEs, of whom women constitute approximately 42 per cent.

However, a lot more needs to be done and it starts with empowering them with the right tools to harness this entrepreneurship potential. “They face many institutional and cultural hurdles while starting or running their businesses. For instance, a recent report shows that only 22 per cent of female entrepreneurs have access to finance against 34 per cent of males. “This is part of why we have introduced Yanga to bridge this gap while also narrowing the population of underbanked women entrepreneurs”. Akinmade further explained that the Unity Yanga product will play a critical role in boosting financial inclusion and narrowing the underbanked women population as the account comes with a unique product proposition that includes an easy to operate and free to open a Savings account, with no identification required, customised debit card, dedicated sales officers. He identified other unique features, including special banking agents in each market location and quarterly seminars at main market locations anchored by Unity Bank and its alliance partners.
