Actress Judy Austin Muoghalu has asked her followers if she should tell her side of the story as the second wife of actor Yul Edochie. Muoghalu welcomed a son with her married colleague last year. But she and Edochie kept the news under wraps until last Wednesday when Edochie caused a stir by announcing that he had not only married Muoghalu as his second wife, but also welcomed a son with her.   619 crew wins Glo Battle of The year finale     Kizz Daniels quits smoking on birthday     Pat Oghre sparks off fresh conversation on girl-child with…   The couple has been in the eye of a social media storm following criticism by Edochie’s first wife and condemnation by Nigerians, many of whom also poohpoohed his plea for funds to buy him the 2023 presidential form of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) party.
