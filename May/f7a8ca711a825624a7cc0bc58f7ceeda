Chairman/National Leader of Cherubim and Seraphim Movement (Surulere District) Ayo Ni O, Prophet Sunday Funsho Korode, has identified leadership defect as a contributing factor to the challenges facing Nigeria. The cleric said for the country to get off its woes and get the leadership it deserves, it must consider persons with certain attributes conducive to achieving peace and growth. Korode listed the attributes, among others, as intellect, temperament, integrity, sound physical and mental health, and the fear of God. He spoke at a briefing heralding the second national symposium of church wardens, titled: The State, The Society and The Church, to hold on May 7.   Police advisory     Bishops endorse Sanwo-Olu for second term     104,564 women trained in entrepreneurship   Korode described the symposium as a ‘national discourse that would contribute to the emergence of a better country where its citizens would benefit from the abundant human and material resources the country is divinely endowed with’. Speakers expected include Vice President Yemi Osinbajo (keynote speaker); Minister of Works and Housing Babatunde Fashola; Chief of Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Isiaka Amao; and Pastor Femi Soyemi of the Shepherd, Disciples of Christ Ministry. He added: “The church is an integral part of the society. It cannot afford to be a passive participant in any community or society. In fact, the church is a capacity builder…the church must strive to raise disciplined, law abiding and morally upright citizens… “The despair in the nation is almost palpable. The structures of state seem grossly inadequate, ill-equipped and ill-prepared to tackle these challenges, and society has been the worse for this ineptitude. There is need to reverse the trend. We cannot be stagnant while other economies are developing. The percentage of our youth and young adults migrating or seeking to migrate to other countries is staggering; we need to be creative to address this and other challenges.”
