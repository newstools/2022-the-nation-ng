Amid wide speculations during the week that the former President Goodluck Jonathan was poised to contest the 2023 presidential election on the platform of APC, a queer confusion arose over his membership of the party. There were unconfirmed claims that he had joined the party in his Ogbia ward in Bayelsa. While some supporters of the former number one citizen were ready to swear with their life that he had defected to APC, the Bayelsa State chairman of the party, Dennis Otiotio, denied was a member.   2023: A crowded presidential race     Osun, Ekiti elections and the race to 2023     Bread now beyond reach of many Africans, says AfDB   While Otiotio’s rejection of Jonathan on behalf of Bayelsa APC was yet to challenged by anyone, PDP National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, compounded the confusion when he said the former President had not resigned as a member of the PDP. He said: “As far as today, I am not aware of any resignation from the membership of the party [PDP]. I would assume it is safe to say that he is a member of the party.” More than forty eight hours after the speculations became alarmingly strong, neither the former president nor any of his aides have said a thing to clear the air by telling the world Jonathan’s current political party. It is safe to say they have gone absent without leave: the man, conveniently so in some West African capital, while his aides have disappeared from all GSM networks.
