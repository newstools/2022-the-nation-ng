FORMER Chairman of Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN) Tunji Oyebanji has accused airline operators of trying to force the Federal Government to introduce subsidy into the aviation industry. Oyebanji said the cries of operators over rising cost was a ploy to make government control the price of aviation fuel. Airline operators had announced that they would suspend operations from May 9 over rising aviation fuel, known as Jet A1 or Aviation Turbine Kerosene (ATK), from N190 to N700 per litre. Ripples Nigeria reported that some airlines – Air Peace, Max Air, Arik Air, Dana Air, Azman Air, United Nigeria Airlines, and Aero Contractors,  pulled out of the dfecision to suspend services.

Oyebanji said on Arise TV that it was an attempt to ‘strongarm’ the government into taking control of the Jet A1 price, rather than allowing market forces determine the cost. He queried why operators didn’t take advantage of the opportunity they had to import aviation fuel. He advised that operators should increase ticket price to reflect the hike in cost of operation. “Airline operators are trying to pressurise government to control prices by fiat. In the alternative, let people pay the appropriate price for airline tickets. Aviation is not a social welfare business. Why are international airlines that we also sell to, not threatening to stop flights?”
