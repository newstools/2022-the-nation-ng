Ondo State Government yesterday signed a partnership agreement with a non-governmental organisation, the Gender Mobile Initiative (GMI), to end gender-based violence and sexual assault in the state-owned tertiary institutions. GMI Executive Director Ms Omowunmi Ogunrotimi, speaking in Akure after the ceremony, praised the Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu administration for having the political will to tackle sexual assault on campuses. She said the partnership would enable the government to adopt its model, while technical support would be provided for the state. Ogunrotimi said the move hoped to strengthen the institutions’ internal mechanism with innovative policy design, to foster accountability and access to justice.
