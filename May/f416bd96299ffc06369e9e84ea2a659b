Governor Simon Lalong has clinched the All Progressives Congress (APC) senatorial ticket for Plateau South. At the primary elections held in Shendam, the zonal headquarters of the senatorial District, the delegates unanimously elected the Governor unopposed through affirmation. Chairman of the APC in Plateau Southern senatorial zone, Alhaji Musa Nyalum, said members resolved to give Lalong their mandate to represent them in the Red Chambers because of his experience and performance as Governor. Chairman of the election panel from the APC National Headquarters Rt. Hon. Titi Oseni said although the Governor was the sole candidate for the elections, the process of voting would still be done in line with the guidelines of the party.
