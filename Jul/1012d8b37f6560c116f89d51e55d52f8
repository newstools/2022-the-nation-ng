Zamfara Governor Bello Matawalle has urged the Federal Government to extend the retirement age of security personnel to 70. He further suggested the entry age limit for Direct Short Service be extended from 30 to 32 years to accommodate more able-bodied persons willing to serve and secure the country. Matawalle, who spoke at his country home in Maradun on Monday, said this would enable retirees that are not tired to continue serving. According to him, this would help sustain successes recorded in the fight against terror and insecurity.   2023: North West APC backs Tinubu-Shettima’s ticket     Pan African Farmers Organisation appoints Nigerian CEO     BREAKING: Lagos PDP Gov candidate unveils Funke Akindele as…   The Governor also promised to make Zamfara the country’s most peaceful State. On the state’s insecurity challenges, Matawalle said: “As you know, we are facing the issue of insecurity in Zamfara. I want to make Zamfara the most peaceful state in Nigeria. I want to make the people of Zamfara secure.” On how to achieve the feat in the face of rampaging bandits, he said: “I will ensure that Zamfara is the most peaceful state, the most secure state in Nigeria. I’m working with some security to be able to achieve this. “I want to appeal to the Federal Government to extend the retirement age of security personnel to 70 years, just like it did with university lecturers and some teachers. My belief is simple: most of those to be retired are not tired.”
