The launch of the estates, which took place last Saturday, attracted over 500 realtors, business partners, investors and prospective landowners from across Lagos. With a land area of over 455 km2 and an estimated population of 117,481(200 census), Ibeju-Lekki is one of the largest Local Government Areas (LGAs) in Lagos and yet, one of the most sparsely population.   ‘57% of electricity consumers on estimated…     70% of world’s 1.4 billion people living in extreme…     Lagos seeks partnerships for cooperative societies   However, with renewed focus on the area, it is expected to become a future central hub for business, manufacturing, warehousing, and logistics.

As more people move into Ibeju-Lekki to live or do business, real estate companies like Eystone Development are helping to fast track development by facilitating a smooth land ownership, offering flexible payment structures. “We want to be part of the development story of Ibeju-Lekki by helping people find their feet here,” said Hassan Ismail, CEO/co-founder of Eystone Development.’’
