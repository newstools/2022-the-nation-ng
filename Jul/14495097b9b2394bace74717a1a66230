Former BBNaija Season 3 housemate, Alexandra Asogwa aka Alex Unusual has appealed to lesbians to leave her DM.

In April, a blog had alleged Alex Unusual was not only a lesbian but was also having an illicit affair with a popular celebrity married man.

Alex unusual also swore not to “live to see the next week and may God make it painful for her” if the allegations were true. Seemingly overwhelmed with rate at which the members of LGBTQ community are trooping into her DM, Alex stated she was ‘straight’ and into responsible men. “Dear lesbians, please I’m into responsible men. Sweethearts, leave my DM. enjoy yourselves and have a nice day,” she wrote.
