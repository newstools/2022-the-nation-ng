The Inspector-General of Police (IGP) Usman Baba has ordered a total ban on all use of Police SPY Vehicle Number Plates by vehicle owners across the country without exceptions. The development, IGP said, is irrespective of whether it is authorised or not as all authorisations were revoked indefinitely. The order, he said, is necessary to forestall the continuous disregard for traffic rules and regulations and other extant laws guiding road use by individuals hiding under the privileges of SPY police number plates. The IGP directed police officers and officers of other security agencies attached to VIPs who use the SPY number plates should ensure prompt compliance with the directive or risk being arrested for violation of the order.

Adejobi said: “Other security agencies and members of the public are enjoined to cooperate with the Police in this regard as the moves are aimed at strengthening our internal security”.
