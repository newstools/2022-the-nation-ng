Man United’s Cristiano Ronaldo has shut down reports about his meeting at Carrington with agent Jorge Mendes. Ronaldo was absent from United’s pre-season tour of Thailand and Australia earlier this month due to family reasons. Sir Alex Ferguson and Richard Arnold were also pictured at Carrington on Tuesday. Ronaldo wants to leave United due to their slow movement in the transfer market and failure to qualify for the Champions League, which has slashed his salary by 25 per cent.

An Instagram account dedicated to Ronaldo news wrote: “Jorge Mendes told Manchester United that Cristiano Ronaldo is adamant about leaving, but Mendes left negotiations less than positive that Ronaldo would get his move. Sir Alex Ferguson has intervened. United insist Ronaldo is not for sale.” In response, Ronaldo commented: “Impossible not to talk about me one day. Otherwise the press makes no money. You know that if you don’t lie you can’t get people’s attention. Keep going then one day you’ll get some news right.”
