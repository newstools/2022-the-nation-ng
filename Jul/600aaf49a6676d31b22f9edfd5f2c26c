Peter Okoye aka Mr P has replied to a fraud victim who accused him of illegally obtaining N7,000 from him. Mr P recently announced his resignation from his privately owned lottery platform Zoom Lifestyle. The PSquare twin, in an emotional video broadcast, explained the constant fraud by impostors forced his into ‘resignation from anchoring or presenting zoom’ every Saturday at noon. He noted the lottery game show would remain but would be ‘run by Sam and the rest of the team in the office’ but will never be seen online and also doing the draws. However, a Twitter user, Victor Bina, called out Mr P for alleging defrauding him of N7,000.
