The Federal Executive Council (FEC) last month approved the digitisation of the NSITF, to be known as e-NSITF to block a financial and productivity leakages. Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, while briefing State House correspondents at the end of the council’s meeting, said the decision to digitise the NSITF was in line with the government’s policy on ease of doing business. The minister had said: “The ministry presented two memos to the council today. The first memo was presented on behalf of our parastatal, NSITF. As you’re aware, a lot has happened in the NSITF in terms of revenue losses and plunder of funds that have been given to that organisation.” Akabogu, who was represented by the Director of Administration at NSITF, Maureen Allaguao, also noted that apart from the blockage of financial leakages, e-NSITF would increase contributions of employers to the pool of funds.
