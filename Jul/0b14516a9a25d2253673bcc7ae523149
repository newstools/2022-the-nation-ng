From the nine boxers representing Nigeria at the ongoing 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, national coach Tony Konyegwachie believes the team has the capacity to amass medals in the event. From the two bronze medals won at the 2018 edition in Gold Coast, Australia, the coach is sure that the team can improve its medals hauls in Birmingham. “We are here to pick medals, not a medal because last time in Gold Coast, we managed to win two bronze medals but this time around, we will be going for the highest medals which will exceed the last edition,” he said.

I can assure you of this,” Konyegwachie added.
