Ajax are reportedly interested in signing Rangers star Calvin Bassey this summer. The Eredivisie side are on the verge of selling star defender Lisandro Martinez to Manchester United. A deal has been struck between the clubs, with United set to pay £46million for the 24-year-old. This means that Ajax needs to replace the left-sided centre-back ahead of the new campaign. And it’s said that Bassey is viewed as the ideal candidate to come into the team. According to talkSPORT’s Alex Crook, the Dutch outfit are looking to Bassey as a replacement for Martinez.

The 22-year-old’s dominant performances in the Europa League – including a man of the match award in last season’s final – as well as impressive showings in domestic action for Rangers have seen interest grow significantly in the player. No bid has been made yet, although, as per previous reports, Rangers are seeking £25m for the defender. It remains to be seen whether Ajax are willing to fork out that figure, with Crook stating that they would prefer to pay a fee of between £15-20million. Crook said Premier League side Brighton are also very interested in Bassey and he was certainly on their list of potential targets this summer. Meanwhile, Rangers’ coach Giovanni van Bronckhorst said Bassey needed time to develop. “He is fantastic. He is a player who is at the beginning of his career but also a player who is open to coaching. He wants to develop himself and hopefully we can have him longer here because I think his development needs to be a couple of years more before he reaches the level that he will be comfortable to get into a new team.”
