NOLLYWOOD stars Monalisa Chinda, Francis Duru, and Ejike Asiegbu, have been billed for a return to the stage for Bimbo Manuel’s play ‘Philomena; Interview With A Prostitute.’ This is coming after a successful show of the sensational stageplay in Port Harcourt, Rivers State.   Tonto Dikeh: I just don’t see myself as actress…     Edochie’s first wife shrugs off marriage drama     Faze, Konga, others thrill at Ruggedman’s Foundation night   This time, Manuel and Chinda, alongside her team at Kike Productions, are taking the stage play to Abuja. Others billed to appear for the show that kicks off on July 22, 2022, through to July 24, 2022, with an exclusive variety show on another date at the NAF Conference Centre, Abuja, are Don Kester Oshioraeme, Tammy Abusi, Zack Iniyedo, and Rekiya Ibrahim Attah. ‘Philomena; Interview With A Prostitute’ tells a story about the deep experiences of three characters — a failed journalist, a retired prostitute, and a frustrated teacher, who share their own stories of the Nigerian social, economic and cultural factors that have stagnated their lives. With humour, satire, and anecdotes — ‘Philomena’, the play, was inspired by an actual interview with a stripper and is a story that was demanded to be told.
