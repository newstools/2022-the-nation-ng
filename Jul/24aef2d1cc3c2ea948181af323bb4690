A pro Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu group, Yoruba Oke-Oya Fun Asiwaju (YOFA), has said the presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), is acceptable in the North like late MKO Abiola who won the 1993 presidential election. Director-General of YOFA, Abdulfattah Olaitan Shittu, stated this in Zaria when he led members of his group on a courtesy visit to the Oba Yoruba in Zazzau Emirate, Alhaji (Bar) Ishak Bello, to seek his blessing and assistance in mobilisation of Yoruba community to participate in the 2023 general elections. Shittu said the North has been magnanimous and demonstrated spirit brotherhood by supporting Tinubu during the APC presidential and in the build up to the general election, but the Yoruba community in the North must wake up and rally round their own, ti show the their host community that, Asiwaju is also accepted and valued at home.

Shittu who said, YOFA would be visiting all the traditional rulers across the 19 northern states, assured Tinubu’s presidency will give the traditional institution constitutional roles, which he believes will help in addressing myriad of challenges confronting the nation, especially security. Responding, Bello said as a traditional rulers, they are fathers to all and constantly working for survival and advancement of Nigerians. He however urged the group to back their belief in Asiwaju as the messiah that Nigeria needs, with prayers that God should chose the best for Nigeria.
