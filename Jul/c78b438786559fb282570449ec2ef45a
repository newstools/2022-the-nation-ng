Anthony Joshua has told Tyson Fury to forget about training him and enjoy a beer instead. AJ has left long-time coach Rob McCracken for his August 20 rematch against Oleksandr Usyk in Saudi Arabia. And he will instead be cornered by former No2 Angel Fernandez and esteemed US mastermind Robert Garcia. The move was blasted by Fury, who claimed to be the only man with the knowledge of beating Usyk. But in response Joshua told The Mirror: “Is there anything I could learn from him? Honestly, no, not really.   Akeredolu’s CCTV order     Don’t drop Okowa as running mate, Igbo youths warn…     Ekweremadu and NASS’ overreach   “For a man that’s retired, go and have a beer, relax, go and help some people who need it. What are you talking about me for? “He’s an interesting character, but I wouldn’t take his help as well. I’ve done my thing. “He has done his, and good luck to him whatever he’s doing.” Fury, 33, announced his retirement after knocking out Dillian Whyte, 34, in April. But returning to fight either Joshua, 32, or Usyk, 35, for all the heavyweight marbles remains a lucrative possibility.
