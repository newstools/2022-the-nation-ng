Ghanaian boxer Shakul Samed has become the first athlete at the ongoing 2022 Commonwealth Games to fail drug tests. With this development, the Ghanaian is out of the competition as Samed’s A sample came back positive for furosemide – a banned masking agent and diuretic – and he has been immediately suspended. The light-heavyweight boxer was due to face Luc Jean Rosalba yesterday (Saturday), but the athlete from Mauritius will instead win by default. The Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) Anti-Doping and Medical Commission has hinted at the boxer of the failure, as well as the Ghana Olympic Committee (GOC). But Samed will be allowed to request an analysis of his B sample or submit any other relevant information before a formal charge is issued. No positive tests were reported at the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games, but it has taken Birmingham 2022 one day of competition to surpass Gold Coast.
