A monarch, the Olu of Agboyi in Lagos State, Oba Monsuru Abimbola Oladega, has said his reign will usher in development. He hailed Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu for approving the Agboyi Link Bridge. The monarch received his certificate and instrument of office from the government about two weeks ago. He urged rival ruling houses to join him in developing the kingdom, as there can be  no progress without unity. Oladega, at a briefing, hailed his receipt of his instrument of office 22 months after his approval as monarch. He attributed the delay to a court case filed by rival royal families in August 2020, which was dismissed this month. According to him, his ascension to the throne on August 20, 2020, had ushered in a new dawn in infrastructural development and social transformation.
