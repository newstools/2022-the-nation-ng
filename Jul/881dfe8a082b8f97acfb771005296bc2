Doctor and digital media creator aka Wakawaka doctor has narrated how moving abroad changed his life. He said it has changed his way of thinking, and created a quest to see more of the world. The social media influencer recalled how he left for Saudi Arabia some years ago leading to remarkable changes in his life. He said: “Believe it or not, I never wanted to move abroad. For me, it wasn’t a plan. It was just a mere coincidence. “On this fateful day, after a very hectic day, hungry and exhausted, I went to eat at my favourite restaurant where I saw a newspaper advert about an opening in one of the countries in the Middle East.

I abandoned my food, went home, packed my documents and took a late bus to Lagos. That move would change my life forever.” Wakawaka Doctor further stated that the financial compensation of his job which is higher abroad prompted him to follow the bag. “I am a medical doctor, who worked two jobs at the time with the financial compensation being less than expected for the energy involved. It was also quite early in my career so I decided to follow the bag. “The move abroad changed my life, way of thinking, and created a quest to see more of the world. “The popular saying “You always think your father’s Garden is the biggest and best until you see another “actually played out in my life. “This was the start of what has become Wakawaka Doctor. Since then I have travelled to 60 countries and seen more than 80 cities.”
