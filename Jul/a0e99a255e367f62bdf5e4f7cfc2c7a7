Singer Portable has told critics to allow him enjoy the proceeds of his political endorsement in peace. He said he is obliged to support any political party that pays him for endorsement stunts. He was reacting to the backlashes of his support for Osun Governor Adegboyega Oyetola for Saturday’s Guber poll. The ‘wahala’ singer recalled the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) neglected him even after he made a song titled: “Ademola Adeleke” to promote their governorship candidate four years ago. He said they did not acknowledge him or his work because he was astruggling, upcoming musical act then. He said the table has turned and he became a star after the All Progressives Candidate (APC) made moves to work with him.

I do music to music to fend for my family. “I got paid by APC to sing my blown song (Zazu) and here are people complaining. “My job is to sings and perform, anything that pays me is what I’ll do. “When I get paid for a job, I’ll do it. I am not a politician. I am a musician. “I hope all my fans understand this because when I was nobody, no one paid me for anything. Now that I got paid to sing, kindly let me do it in peace.”
