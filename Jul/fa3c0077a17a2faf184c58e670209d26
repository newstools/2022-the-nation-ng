Super Eagles goalkeepers’ trainer Ike Shorunmu  has dismissed insinuations  that  Maduka Okoye is no longer interested  in pulling on the famous green and white colours of Nigeria, adding  the national team doors are very much open to the newly-signed Watford goaltender. Okoye has missed  six straight Super Eagles matches as  he suffered backlash from the fans  after he inadvertently conceded the solitary goal in the  Africa Cup of Nations Round of 16 defeat to Tunisia  in Cameroon  in February. Though COVID-19 reportedly kept him away from  featuring  in the decisive Qatar 2022  World Cup African zone play-off against Ghana,  there are speculations  that Okoye  is no longer willing to feature  for the Super Eagles. “ What he said  was that he wanted to concentrate on his club  at the moment,” Shorunmu, the Super Eagles goalkeeper to the 2002 FIFA World Cup in Korea & Japan, told  Brila FM. “ You can’t force him (to play for the Super Eagles)  since we can equally give other chances too.
