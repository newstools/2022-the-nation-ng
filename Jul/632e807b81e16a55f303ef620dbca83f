The Lagos State Ministry of Education has shut the Redeemers Nursery and Primary School, Ogba. The school, the Commissioner for Education (Mrs.) Folasade Adefisayo said yesterday, will remain closed, pending an administrative investigation of its operations and procedures as well as the conduct of its officials – in line with schools’ safety standards and guidelines. A statement by the ministry indicated that the closure is sequel to the death of a five-year-old pupil, who is suspected to have drowned during a swimming lesson while in the custody of the school.
