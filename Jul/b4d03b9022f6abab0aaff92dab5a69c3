Pan-Yoruba socio-cultural organisation, Afenifere, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to use the remaining months in office to implement reports of the 2014 National Conference and the Nasir El-Rufai Committee on True Federalism. It said both reports, if implemented, would provide solution to most of the problems plaguing the country, especially the security-related ones. In a statement yesterday in Akure, the Ondo State capital, Afenifere’s Secretary General Sola Ebiseni said statements credited to President Buhari during the Sallah celebration were amusing.   Buhari: ‘Something to remember me by’     Choosing to act     Double jeopardy? Just as well!   Ebiseni said the President merely lamented the six-month strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASSU) without proffering any solution or giving any assurance on how soon the nation’s students would return to school. He said: “The Daura lamentation is both an admission of incapacity and failure, the natural consequence or effect of which is to take a bow and relieve himself of further torment by a duty of mutual disaster to the labourer and more so to the farm owners. “The call, only two months back, for a Government of National Unity, or for the resignation of the President, would have no doubt found justification in this admission. Yet, the situation today is quite different from the factors that made such suggestions then plausible. “Rather than chicken out, President Buhari could still, within the remaining months, rally his government, including the distraught National Assembly members, to leave last minute legacies that will temper the harsh verdict of history.”
