TotalEnergies has begun oil production from the Ikike field located in oil mining lease (OML) 99. The field, owned jointly with the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, was discovered in 1977, with TotalEnergies (the operator) holding 40 per cent shares and NNPC 60 per cent shares. Located 20 kilometres off the coast, at a depth of about 20 meters, the Ikike platform is tied back to the existing Amenam offshore facilities through a 14 km multiphase pipeline. It will deliver peak production of 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by the end of 2022.

In addition, 95 per cent of hours were worked locally: the jacket as well as the topside modules were entirely built and integrated by local contractors. “TotalEnergies is pleased to start production at Ikike, which was launched a few months before the covid pandemic, and whose success owes a lot to the full mobilisation of the teams. By tapping discoveries close to existing facilities, this project fits the Company’s strategy of focusing on low-cost and low-emission oil projects,” said Henri-Max Ndong-Nzue, Senior Vice President Africa, Exploration and Production at TotalEnergies.
