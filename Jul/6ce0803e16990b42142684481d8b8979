Ogun State Governor Dapo Abiodun has sympathised with the Nigerian Union of Teachers (NUT) and family of the late Sunday Ogunjimi, a teacher in the state. A statement by the Head of Service, Dr Nafiu Aigoro, described Ogunjimi’s death as a big loss to his family, organised labour and the state at large. Ogunjimi slumped on Friday at the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) secretariat in Abeokuta before labour leaders could address workers on the outcome of their meeting with the government.

We pray that God will grant the deceased eternal rest and comfort the family, colleagues and associates he left behind.” Abiodun reiterated the government’s commitment to the welfare and wellbeing of the workforce. He said his administration remains a promise-keeping administration, and will strive to honour all the terms of agreement reached with labour leaders.
