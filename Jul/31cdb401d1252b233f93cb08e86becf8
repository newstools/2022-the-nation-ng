A group of widows, known as O-widow, has declared its support for the Accord Party governorship candidate, Akin Ogunbiyi, saying he is the only candidate who has the ability to turn things around in Osun State. A letter by three of its executive members – Mrs. Modupe Olawumi-Oyewole (Leader), Mrs. Oladunmomi Oseni and Mrs. Taibat Kasali, said Ogunbiyi’s manifesto clearly paved the way for good governance.   Why I selected Shettima as running mate, by Tinubu     Oyetola to Adeleke: your mandate was not stolen     Obi-dient tyrants?   According to them, many of their late husbands were retirees who were not paid their entitlements until death, leaving them lonely and wallowing in abject poverty. The letter reads: “We have carefully studied the manifesto of all the candidates and we can see clearly that only the Accord candidate has something good to offer our women. “Two of these programmes are the plan to give women interest-free loans, and the plan to pay gratuities of all retired public servants between six and nine months. For this reason, about 1,500 of our members across the state are in one accord to vote for Accord party. We are also mobilising across the state, and we are sure Dr. Ogunbiyi will win the election.” O-widow vowed they will resist and pray against anyone who plans to cause trouble during the election, and advised the people to shun ‘blood money’ to be shared by some politicians before and during the election.
