Fast-rising skitmaker Gabriel Victoria Omozele aka Flora has lashed out at females who allow themselves to be sexually exploited by popular skit makers and TikTokers Flora, in a viral TikTok video, alleged many known skitmakers and TikTokers have s3xual relations with ladies promising to feature them in their skits. Appalled at the act, Flora vehemently condemned it while berating the ladies noting a feature from a well-known skitmaker or TikToker’s doesn’t guarantee success of that video or the ladies’ in question. According to her, if a lady must engage in coitus, it should be of her own volition because she desires to do so and not because some so-called celebrity is demanding it, promising to feature them in their work. She said: “So they now sleep with people to put them in their TikTok videos.

I hope you know that if you do one video with a known TikToker doesn’t guarantee you success for your TikTok? Doesn’t guarantee that the whole world will know you or you will blow from there. “Stop allowing these boys take advantage of you all in the name of “I’ll put you in my skit and video”. Dem no get sense. Stop it!” “If you want to do it, do it because it’s what you really want to do. ‘Oh! I like that celebrity , I want to sleep with him.’ “Do it because that’s what you have on your mind. Stop.dping it because of one miserable skit or TikTok. They’ll be choking you, grabbing your breasts because of content with 16k views.”
