An example is me, I studied psychology, and I graduated with a psychology degree, opposite from my reality, but while I was in school, I took a few art courses and I realized that I enjoyed it a whole lot more of course and I got to understand that I got very good grades when it came to my art courses. The little that I was able to learn during that period gave me huge self-esteem because you need to learn how to speak in front of a crowd, you need to learn how to be free, and you need to learn how not to be reserved. I sometimes wish I was able to learn more, I do see the difference in those who were able to commit full time to that education.” Continuing, she said, “There is detail, there is intentional understanding and you cannot beat that at all. Talent is very important however there are principles in philosophy that you only get through teaching, reading and when we speak on education it doesn’t have to be you just going to school, you can educate yourself, you can read, you can buy lots of books, you can buy books about acting, film or anything in the art form you can educate yourself and learn” she noted. Linda attended St. Thomas Aquinas High School and York University in Toronto Canada in 2013 where she obtained her Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology.
