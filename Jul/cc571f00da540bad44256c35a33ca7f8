CANADIAN-BASED Nigerian rapper, Selick Idahosa aka Sleek has tasked Nigerian leaders to do well and fix up the country. The rap act, in a chat with The Nation, noted that Nigeria is blessed with a lot of resources and talents but has not been able to cater to its people nor attained her greatest potential. “The greedy politicians should fix up the country. We could’ve been like Dubai a long time ago because we have the resources, why not fix our country to draw in more people which would bring more people to Nigeria, pay your people well, create more jobs, and also the police taking money. The youth are so talented and skillful but they don’t have an outlet to showcase it, All eyes are on Nigeria, we must do better,” he said.
