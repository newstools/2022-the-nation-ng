ONE Woman, a proposition for women by Sterling Bank Plc, has partnered with the International Women’s Society (IWS) to commemorate International Widows Day (IWD) in Nigeria. International Widows Day was created by the United Nations (UN) to draw attention to widows’ voices and experiences and galvanize the exceptional support they need. The theme of this year’s IWD is: ‘There is a day for that.’ Mrs. Ifunanya Ugboko, Head of the One Woman team at Sterling Bank, addressed the widows and other stakeholders at an event to commemorate the day in Lagos. She explained that the One Woman Proposition is gender-based banking, through which the bank identifies and offers bespoke solutions to problems that affect Nigerian women.   ‘My abductors cut my long hair with machete, fearing it was…     Owo attack: US senators want Nigeria restored to religious…     UK to send Nigerian criminals home to serve jail terms   According to her, “We have recognized that a lot of women live their lives trying to satisfy others and retire into poverty at old age as unhappy women.” She noted that women need to be more intentional about themselves. Ugboko, who assured the women that there was certainly light at the end of the tunnel, also urged them to seek solace in their children because they would bring back the sparkle they thought had left them following the demise of their husbands. The Head of One Woman noted that women go through three stages after losing their husbands: the grief stage, the growth stage, and the grace stage. She encouraged widows in attendance to show kindness to other widows as women rise by lifting each other. Additionally, she advised them to view Sterling Bank as their partner that will handhold them through their growth stage by empowering them financially, adding that financial empowerment is one of the greatest assets a woman requires.
