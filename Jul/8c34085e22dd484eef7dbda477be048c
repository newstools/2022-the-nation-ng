Some retail outlets in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) have  hiked their Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) pump price to N185 per litre. This is a negation of the regulated product that the Federal Government pegged its maximum band at N165 per litre. When The Nation monitored the petrol market during the Sallah break on Sunday, many retail outlets did not open to customers. Meanwhile, the Enyo Petrol Station in Deidei sold the product for N185 per litre.   2023: North West APC backs Tinubu-Shettima’s ticket     Banditry: Extend security forces’ retirement age,…     BREAKING: Lagos PDP Gov candidate unveils Funke Akindele as…   Similarly, yesterday, the A. A. Rano Petrol Station near Mpape Junction, the A. A. Petrol Station in Aya, Asokoro vended the product at N185 per litre. The Total by Jahi Junction by Kubwa Expressway sold the product at N165 per litre on Sunday. When The Nation called the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) General Manager, Corporate Communications Department, Mr. Kimchi Apollo, on the phone to find out if the Federal Government had deregulated the price of petrol for the aforementioned retail outlets to vend the product above the pump price, he said PMS is still regulated. Continuing, Apollo said he had just bought petrol at N165 per litre at a filling station in Abuja. “I don’t think I have any comment on that right now. I am not aware. I just bought fuel for N165 per litre from Etena Filling Station. On Wednesday, I will get in touch with you,” he said.
