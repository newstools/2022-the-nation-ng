Kidnappers of two Nollywood stars Cynthia Okereke and Clemson Cornel aka Agbogidi have demanded $100,000 ransom for their release. The ransom demand came 24 hours after the members of the Actors Guild of Nigeria (AGN) were kidnapped in an Enugu suburb. According to the AGN national president, Emeka Rollas, the actors’ abductors have contacted their families for the ransom. He said: “The kidnappers have made contact with the families and are demanding the sum of $100,000. We pray to God for his intervention and for Him to put confusion in their midst. “We are also working closely with the different security operatives but we are not sure what to expect from them because the same thing is happening everywhere in the country.”   Tension over alleged murder of woman in Anambra community     England beat Germany to win women Euro 2022     Tiwa Savage reveals man behind ‘Somebody’s son’ hit track   Rollas also confirmed the kidnappers clearing all the funds in one of the abductees’ accounts. He said: ‘‘The kidnappers cleared the monies in Cynthia Okereke’s account this (Saturday) morning.’’ Rollas also said as part of measures to prevent a repeat occurrence, the Guild had ordered its members not to shoot outside of the metropolis and ensure that they make adequate provisions for security in their locations. The abdutees reportedly went missing after failing to return home from a film location at Ozalla Town, Enugu State on Thursday. They are renowned for starring in films shot in Enugu and Delta states.
