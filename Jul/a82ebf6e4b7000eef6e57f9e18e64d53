An Anglican Bishop, Rt Rev Emmanuel Adekunle, has expressed concerns over the high rate of drug abuse,internet fraud and rituals in the country. He emphasised the need for partnership with Abeokuta Grammar School Old Boys’ Association, (AGSOBA) and other stakeholders to help redirect the mind of pupils to the Lord. Adekunle stated this at a sermon to mark 114th Founder’s Day Anniversary of Abeokuta Grammar School at the St Peter’s Cathedral Church, Ake Abeokuta. He said the theme: Breaking the yoke of Cultism,ritual and drugs amongst secondary school, was a timely issue that needs urgent attention to avoid further moral degeneration.

This is the evil and we are at risk of losing more to join them until something urgent is done,” he said. The cleric, who took his text from Exodus 20:3, said idolatry and ritualism are sinful. Adekunle explained the earlier the pupils are exposed to the dangers of drugs,rituals and cultism,the earlier they run away from it. Bishop Adekunle challenged the church, state, parents, elders and other stakeholders to help youths in finding the right focus in life. The cleric appreciated the President General, Chief Sunday Oduntan, for taking up the initiative to return AGSOBA Founder’s day thanksgiving to the church, which is a laudable step. He prayed for more robust relationship between the church and the school to instil moral among youths, saying education started from the temple.
