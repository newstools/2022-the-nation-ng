The House of Representatives yesterday urged the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited to establish and equip more depots across the country and strictly regulate the operations of private depot owners as part of efforts to end fuel scarcity in the country. This followed the adoption of a motion on the ‘Need to Establish More Petrol Depots in Nigeria moved by Hon. Uju Kingsley. While presenting the motion, Hon Kingsley noted that there were insufficient depots to store petroleum products in Nigeria and that an estimated 100 million litres of bad petrol imported in Nigeria have caused fuel scarcity in Nigeria with the consequent effect of adulteration of the product by roadside black market vendors. He raised concern that the proliferation of adulterated petrol had caused severe damage to vehicle engines and inflicted more pains on the people.   Prioritising people     Was it a warning shot?

The House mandated its Committee on Petroleum Resources (Downstream) to ensure compliance.
