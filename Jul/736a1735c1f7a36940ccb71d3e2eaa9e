Former Kogi West Senator, Dino Melaye has claimed that the presidential candidate of Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi was not known “nationally” until the standard bearer of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar “identified him”. Dino, who spoke at an event over the weekend, described Atiku as a “talent hunter”. He noted that there are only two contestants in the 2023 presidential race — Atiku and Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress(APC). According to him: “I am happy that everybody here is singing one song and that is Atiku for president. Many are already voting on social media but INEC has no voting centre on social media   Tension over alleged murder of woman in Anambra community     England beat Germany to win women Euro 2022     Tiwa Savage reveals man behind ‘Somebody’s son’ hit track   “Atiku supporters are real, they are original. You can see them and they have PVCs. We have two very important people contesting this election. Atiku Abubakar, the Wazirin Adamawa and Bola Ahmed Tinubu of the APC. “At 75, what is new that Atiku would be looking for other than to set the pedestal for the upcoming generation to have a life they can call their own? So this competent Nigerian that is highly mobile and administratively sagacious is coming to change the narrative. “Obi is a fantastic Nigerian but he was not known nationally until Atiku identified him. Atiku is a talent hunter. Everyone who was a reformer in this country between 1999 to date was a discovery of Atiku. “Atiku discovered Obi before keyboard warriors discovered Obi. Unfortunately, elections are not going to take place on social media. “It is going to take place at the polling units. And those that would vote are the people here. So it is now operation votes must count.”
