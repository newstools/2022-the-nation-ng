Deontay Wilder wants to face the winner of Anthony Joshua and Oleksandr Usyk’s rematch. That is according to Wilder’s manager Shelly Finkel, who claims his fighter will be keeping a close eye on the Saudi showdown on August 20. But he knows a potential fight with Joshua or Usyk would likely depend on Fury’s future. Finkel told Planet Sport: “Maybe the winner of Usyk and Joshua. I don’t know what Fury is doing? “Maybe if Joshua wins it’s a huge fight in the UK [between those two] – there’s so many intangibles so we’re looking to see what happens in that fight [Usyk and Joshua]. “I don’t care what Fury says, we’re waiting to see what he really wants to do because if he wants to fight the winner then he’s going to get it. But after that, where are the top guys?

Then once if any of those are real, that’ll dictate another opponent.” Famous boxing promoter Frank Warren claims Wilder will return to the ring in October and could face Robert Helenius. The 36-year-old, who counts 42 wins and two losses in 45 fights, hasn’t tasted victory since knocking Luis Ortiz out in 2019 as he went on to lose to Fury twice. Warren told talkSPORT: “Deontay is fighting in October; he’s coming back, and they’re talking about him fighting [Helenius], and that’ll be in the States. “I’d love to do that fight, but he’s [Deontay] coming off a bad knockout. There’s no doubt about that was a bad knockout against Tyson Fury, who was a tough fight for him.”
