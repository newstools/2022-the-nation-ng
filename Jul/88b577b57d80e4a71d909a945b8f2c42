According to police spokesman, SP Benjamin Hundeyin, the mob numbering over 200, pelted the policemen with stones and destroyed a Lexus Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV) parked within the company. “When it became apparent that the mob was hell-bent on lynching the policemen, the policemen justifiably used their firearm.  One of the attackers was hit, and is currently responding to treatment at the hospital. “The policemen were able to protect themselves and prevented further destruction. Normalcy has returned to the area. Investigation has commenced to arrest other fleeing attackers, after which they will be prosecuted,” Hundeyin said on a post shared on his Twitter handle.
