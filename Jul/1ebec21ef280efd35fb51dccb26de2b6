The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) has sealed 10 packaged water companies in Ondo State over non-compliance with the regulation and standards. State Coordinator Benu Philip said the companies were sealed between January and June. According to him, the affected companies were operating with expired licence and producing in an unhygienic environment. “In addition to locking the facilities, the companies will pay an administrative charge for late renewal of their registration licence and submit necessary documents for the renewal process,” he said   PDP members join APC in Oyo     Lawmaker to constituents: don’t cheat yourself     Ekiti residents urge governor-elect to prioritise security   Philip added that the licence issued is not forever and so renewal periods should be sustained to avoid regulatory interruption. He advised Nigerians to always look out for the NAFDAC registration number on sachet and bottled water, batch information and date markings. He added: “Our mandate, specifically, is to regulate and control the manufacturing of food, drugs, cosmetics, medical devices and chemicals, which we refer to as regulated products. What we do in Ondo State majorly is to engage the stakeholders to keep them abreast of our mandate to ensure they follow the rules. “Most of the packaged water, popularly called ‘pure water’, have been operating with expired licence. The licence is the marketing authorisation that enables you to sell your product in the market as verified and safe for consumption. Once you have that number on your certificate, it shows that you have gone through the regulatory processes that says you make safe products to the consuming public, but it is not forever; it has a timeline.” Philip said the agency will continue to collaborate with other agencies to ensure its set goals and targets were achieved.
