The Afenifere Renewal Group (ARG) has appealed to politicians in the Southwest to support the presidential bid of the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, in the general election. The socio-cultural group stressed on the imperative of unity among the southwest politicians, and the need to coalesce efforts with other zones in ensuring Tinubu becomes the next president. Publicity Secretary and Chairman of Ajoni LCDA in Ekiti State Prince Michael Ogungbemi, who addressed a news conference yesterday in Ado-Ekiti, the Ekiti state capital, called on the politicians to shun divisive politics but forge a strong and united front in the overall interest of the Southwest.

This is not the time for ego or sulking in the enmity of the past; we must chart a new course and work hard with other zones for Tinubu to ascend the throne. “We hereby urge Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Chief Bisi Akande, Governors Rotimi Akeredolu, Kayode Fayemi, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, Rauf Aregbesola, and other bigwigs in the progressive fold to midwife sincere and genuine reconciliation among contending forces and unite for Tinubu. “The trajectory of election in Nigeria since 1999 clearly presents an unassailable narrative that no zone can singlehandedly produce the president without recourse to the sensibilities and cooperation of others. With this reality, we must jettison primordial sentiments and divisive comments, and form a formidable coalition with other ethnic nationalities to galvanise support for Asiwaju Tinubu in the 2023 election…” The ARG, however, expressed confidence that with strong political networks, structures and contacts that Tinubu had erected over the years, coupled with his cosmopolitan political stature, the APC is set and more than ready to win the 2023 presidential poll.
