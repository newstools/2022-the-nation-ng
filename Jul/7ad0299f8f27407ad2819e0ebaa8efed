Oyekanmi, in a statement yesterday, said Omigbodun will develop Osun’s economy using creative means, especially Information Technology (I.T).   Wike’s camp gives ‘Ayu must go’ condition to back Atiku     Sanwo-Olu, Ganduje, Omisore confident of victory     Yakubu: we’ll beat Ekiti’s record in Osun   He said electing Omigbodun will bring a shift from dependence on the Federal Government for funds. The statement reads: “A careful observation will reveal that the other contestants, particularly, those who have had a chance to serve in government, have failed us, unlike the performance records of Goke Omigbodun as Osun State Program Monitoring Adviser of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). “Others, in fact, seem to be birds of a feather, and they are in some way responsible for the chaos that may have come over the state. Omigbodun is very ready for the job. He is looking at other creative ways of developing Osun’s economy, particularly through Information Technology.”
