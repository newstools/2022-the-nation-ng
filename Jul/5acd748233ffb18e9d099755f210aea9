ON Friday, April 8, 2022, the Real Housewives of Lagos debuted with several people streaming the show. As promised, the Real Housewives of Lagos lived up to its billing with the audience talking about all of the 12 episodes in hush tones, at pubs, bars, and on social media. For the Nigerian edition of the reality show, the drama was not only guaranteed but served a la carte with real-life shades complimenting members of the cast’s social currencies. As season one of the Real Housewives of Lagos ends, three scenarios have played out among the six characters of the reality show by Showmax. Toyin Lawani-Adebayo, Iyabo Ojo, Mariam Timmer, Laura Ikeji-Kanu, Chioma Ikokwu, and Carolyna Hutchings opened their world to fans and viewers across Africa and Europe while working hard to form a formidable bond of friendship.   Nollywood needs more funding, says Wale Muraina     ‘I get my story from real life experiences’     Mr Macaroni, Broda Shaggi, MC Lively star in Survivor   The friendship bond, which the six wealthy women living in highbrow areas in Lagos tried endlessly to form, has become their only albatross. From the first episode till the 11th episode, Laura appeared to be the only problem in the pack until the Dubai trip in the 12th episode. It took a fight between Iyabo and Carolyna to open up a can of worms that Toyin had consistently warned about in her confessional. Laura was vindicated when Chioma and Carolyna went their separate ways after a nasty and dirty fight. Before the fight, Carolyna had engaged in a bitter feud with Iyabo that saw the two exchanging fisticuffs safe for other women. Fans and the audience look forward to the reunion scheduled for July after the last episode. Filmed and produced by Darey and Deola Art-Alade’s Livespot production for Showmax, the reality show explores the seaside and avant-garde sceneries of Lagos while oozing the burgeoning luxurious lifestyle attributed to Lagos and Lagosians.
