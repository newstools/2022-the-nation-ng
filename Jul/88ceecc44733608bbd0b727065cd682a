The Maritime Workers’ Union of Nigeria (MWUN), Nigerian Association of Road Transport (NARTO), Association of Maritime Truck Owners (AMATO) and Road Transport Employers Association of Nigeria (RTEAN) have withdrawn their membership from the Council of Maritime Transport Unions and Associations (COMTUA). They accused the council of breaching the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) members signed, citing the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW). MWUN, in a mail to the Managing Director of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Mr. Mohammed Koko-Bello, signed by its Secretary-General, Felix Akingboye, stated: “the Maritime Workers’ Union of Nigeria (MWUN) has withdrawn from the Council of Maritime Transport Unions and Association (COMTUA).

Also,  Chief Remi Ogungbemi of AMATO, has confirmed their exit from COMTUA. He said: “It has got to our notice that AMATO is being mentioned, printed or paraded as a member of COMTUA. Therefore, it has become expedient for us to inform the relevant authorities and the public that there was never a time AMATO aligned with COMTUA, and will not be part of COMTUA.”
