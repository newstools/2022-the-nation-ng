Barcelona president Joan Laporta has vowed to do all he can to re-sign Lionel Messi next summer when the PSG star’s contract expires. Messi, 35, exited the Nou Camp to join the French giants on a free transfer in 2021, calling an emotional end to his 21-year Barcelona career. Laporta, who admitted he feels ‘indebted’ to the Argentine superstar, is set to do everything in his power to lure him back to the Catalan club next year. ‘I feel indebted to Leo Messi,’ he said. ‘I would like him to end his career in a Barca shirt, and be applauded at all the stadiums.

At least that is the dream.’ Ongoing financial problems prevented Barcelona from offering Messi anywhere close to his £500,000-a-week contract in 2021, prompting the forward to seek fresh pastures in France. Messi broke down in tears during his exit interview but could now be set for an equally emotional return next year if Laporta is able to orchestrate a deal. He notched 670 goals and 302 assists in 776 games during his two-decade spell at Barcelona. Barcelona have seemingly managed to turn their problematic financial situation around through TV rights sales this summer, splurging over £140million on Sevilla defender Jules Kounde, Leeds winger Raphinha and Bayern Munich star Robert Lewandowski.
