Popular actor, Yul Edochie has offered to address the homeless state of his senior colleague, Kenneth Jideofor aka Aguba. On Monday, photos of the ‘poorly-looking’ veteran actor surfaced on the internet where he was seen seated on a wooden stool in front of a locked shop with few worn out personal effects around, suggesting he was homeless. The visibly scruffy-looking state of Aguba and the environment he was seen elicited diverse reactions from well-meaning individuals. Reacting, to the news, the former presidential aspirant via a tweet noted Aguda’s current predicament will be taken care of swiftly if anyone can get him to make a video calling out his account details.   I look like old retired ‘prostitute’ on Android…     I’m proudly gay, says actor Maduagwu     I’m working on collabo with Burna Boy, Tu Face, Wizkid…   He noted they all will ensure Aguda never lacks anything again through crowdfunding. “This one is a small matter. Me I don’t believe in too much talk or time wasting. Just get him to do a short video calling out his account details and post it online. “We’ll do crowdfunding for him. He’ll never lack anything again”, Yul tweeted. Sharing a screenshot of his tweet via his Instagram page, the 40-year-old actor added: “Anyone who can reach Aguba, please do. Na small matter be dis.”
