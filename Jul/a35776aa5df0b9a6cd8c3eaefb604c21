Capital Express Assurance Limited has expressed its commitment to making life insurance policies more accessible to its customers through its digital channels. The Managing Director, Capital Express, Mrs Bola Odukale, in a statement, said the company introduced its mobile app and USSD channels to make it easy for the public to get life insurance covers and process their claims. She said: “We’ve created and launched our mobile app for customers to get different life insurance policies, make premium payments, monitor the status of their policies and process their claims faster without walking into our branches. “These platforms are interactive and give our policyholders the opportunity to engage us and seek clarification on the things they need to know about their policies with the company.”   African Alliance settles N4.08b claims in six months     Cornerstone records 19% revenue growth, others     ‘AIICO conducts operations with global ESG goals, others’   By using the USSD code of the company, Mrs Odukale said, customers could have access to their products from any where. She said the digital platforms allow the users to renew their policies, lodge any complaint and track transaction records which are on the app. “The apps can be installed on mobile phones from the App Store (iOS) and Play Store (Android). As a customer-centric organisation, Capital Express ensured that the Apps are user-friendly and convenient to use for old and new customers. “These two features are targeted at simplifying the process of buying insurance and operating insurance policies without having to visit our office or get worried over engaging with the organisation,” she added.
