The All Progressive Congress (APC) will give its presidential candidate Asiwaju Bola Tinubu 25 percent votes in at least four of the Southeast States in 2023. The Anambra Coordinator of the group, Hero Emmanuel, told The Nation some people had been sponsoring attacks against Tinubu on social media because of what he described as envy. The group described the APC candidate as a unifier, pacesetter and visionary leader, who should be emulated instead of being envious of his achievements in politics. “He is a true democrat who believes in nurturing and raising leaders. When Tinubu reached his term limit after eight years in office in a democratic process, he raised others who are currently, the leaders in Nigeria today from the North to the West and down to the East.

He said Anambra State would be balkanised among four political parties. The parties, according to Emmanuel, are APC, the People’s Democratic Party (PDP,) All Progressives Grand Alliance APGA and Labour Party (LP).
