The Toffees sold Brazilian Richarlison to Tottenham earlier in the window in a £60m deal as they look to ease the financial burden on the club. But now they are tasked with replacing him to ensure their squad is strong enough to compete in the Premier League, and Nigeria international Dennis has emerged as a target. Dennis has been linked with several Premier League clubs after scoring ten goals and registering six assists last season for the Hornets, but he couldn’t stop them from getting relegated to the Championship.
