Super Eagles striker Cyriel Dessers scored Genk’s first goal of the new Jupiler League season but his efforts were not enough as the Limburgers suffered a 3-2 defeat at Club Brugge. Dessers played his first competitive game since his return for Feyenoord. In the absence of Onuachu who is injured, coach Vrancken handed Dessers a starting shirt. However, the game did not start on a good note for the Limburgers, as they conceded in the 22nd  minute, courtesy of a strike from Andreas Skov Olsen. Genk came storming back, and within eight minutes after they went behind, they struck. Dessers did well to get on the end of a low cross from Daniel Munoz, and he promptly tapped the ball in from close range.
