The European Union (EU) will  soon replace the gas from Russia with Nigeria’s gas following  the invasion in Ukraine. The European Union (EU) Delegation to Nigeria and ECOWAS disclosed this yesterday. Deputy Director-General Department for (Energy), European Commission in Brussels, Mr Matthew Baldwin, said this at a news conference on Friday in Abuja. “In summary, I am on a mission from Europe to try to deliver Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) today in the context of NLG partnership tomorrow with Nigeria.

According to him, you would have seen perhaps early this week, we launched a gas demand reduction plan and we are looking to reduce demand of gas by 15 per cent to manage the demand aspect of the equation. “To be clear, we need to manage the supply side and that’s why we want to expand what is currently at 14 per cent shares of our total LNG import from Nigeria and we want it to go up. “Our gas percentage was 60 per cent but now we want to go,’’ he said.
