Iga Swiatek’s 37-match winning streak was brought to a shuddering halt at Wimbledon by Alize Cornet on Saturday as Nick Kyrgios and Stefanos Tsitsipas faced off in a mouthwatering clash. Cornet, ranked 37, took advantage of an error-strewn performance from the Polish world No 1 to triumph 6-4, 6-2 on Court One. Swiatek never looked comfortable in the third-round tie against the French veteran, losing her serve five times and making 33 unforced errors. The 21-year-old had not lost a match since her defeat to Jelena Ostapenko in February in Dubai, winning her past six tournaments, including the French Open. “I know I didn’t play good tennis,” said the top seed, who lost the last six games of the match. “I was pretty confused about my tactics.

For sure, it wasn’t a good performance from me.” In reaching the fourth round, Cornet matches her run at Wimbledon in 2014, during which she beat Serena Williams. Cornet, who faces Ajla Tomljanovic for a place in the quarterfinals, said the win reminded her of her shock victory against Williams, also on Court One, describing the court as a “lucky charm”. In the men’s tournament, Greek fourth seed Tsitsipas is the only other top-10 player aside from Rafael Nadal left in his side of the draw, while fiery Australian Kyrgios is a match for anybody on his day. Tsitsipas’s confidence is sky-high after he clinched his first grass-court title in Mallorca last week but he is facing a man he has beaten just once in their four meetings.
