Task Force set up by the Anambra State government yesterday demolished the Mountain of Holy Ghost Intervention and Deliverance Ministry in Onitsha owned by controversial Prophet Chukwuemeka Ohanaemere, aka Odumeje. The church was, in April, identified as one of the buildings on a drainage channel, and marked for demolition, in line with Onitsha Urban Renewal Plan spearheaded by Governor Charles Soludo. During the demolition exercise, Odumeje was manhandled by security agents attached to the task force  following his attempt to stop the officials from demolishing his church. A viral video showed the cleric being manhandled by security men, including police officers and vigilantes. He was severally slapped, and restricted from moving to the demolition area by armed security men.
