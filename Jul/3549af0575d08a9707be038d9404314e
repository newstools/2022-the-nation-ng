The Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Professor Mahmood Yakubu yesterday urged electoral officers to be above board in today’s governorship election in Osun State. He appealed to them to build on the success of the Ekiti, Ondo and Edo governorship polls by making the exercise free, fair and transparent. He said: “I have assured our stakeholders and the people of Osun State that the Commission will not do anything to the advantage or disadvantage of any political party or candidate. “We have made adequate arrangements for the election. We have promised a level playing field for all. The security agencies have assured us of safety.” Yakubu said in a statement that the electoral agency will not condone indiscipline and laxity.

Yakubu added:”You must also stick to the Oath of Neutrality to which we have all subscribed. I have the confidence in your ability to consolidate on our recent successes.” The Chairman said Nigerians will understandably hold the commission responsible for the promises made to them on electoral sanity. His words:”They will observe our attitude and behaviour from the opening to the closing of polls. They will particularly observe our management of the election results and measure the extent of our adherence to the extant laws through every stage of the electoral process. “I appeal to you to uphold our Code of Conduct, display your usual sense of commitment and professionalism, remain above board and firmly resist any unethical behaviour. You must also stick to the Oath of Neutrality to which we have all subscribed. I have the confidence in your ability to consolidate on our recent successes.”
