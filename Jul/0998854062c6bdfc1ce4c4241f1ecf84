Miners in Niger State have faulted the ban on mining activities and motorcycles by the Federal Government, warning it could lead to more terror attacks. Chairman of the Nigeria Miners Association Niger chapter, Alhaji Mohammed Mambo, said the ban would create an avenue for the recruitment of youths into banditry, terrorism and other social vices. According to him, the country is already tense, stating the government does not need to make the situation worse than it is. Speaking to newsmen in Minna, Mambo said the ban will create unemployment among youths and women engaged in the mining industry across the country.

The chairman stated instead of banning mining and motorcycles, the government should intensify its support to the security agencies to bring an end to the insecurity across the country. He added it was surprising President Muhammadu Buhari, who called for diversification of the economy to mining resources, is advocating ban on mining activities in the country. The representative of Women in Mining, Khadijat Alimashawun, said that there are registered and licenced miners, assuring they leave no room for any security breach.
