According to the coalition, 27 organised youth bodies affiliated to the NYCN have kept faith with the APC led administration and supported its policies to the chagrin of the opposition and traducers of the government. “In the course of this partnership, we in the organised youth bodies bonded with the party and expected their reciprocity, especially in line with the continuous promise of President Muhammadu Buhari that leadership will be stepped down to the youth and that youth inclusion in governance will be non-negotiable,” the group stated. It added: “We know that this promise will not be automatic and the youth have continued to work hard and position themselves in the hope that there will be a negotiated starting point. “We accept that outcome wholeheartedly and congratulate him once again. However, the youth demand that the Vice Presidential ticket should go to a young person, not more than 50 years.”
