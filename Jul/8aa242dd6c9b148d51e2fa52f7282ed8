Popular singer Omah Lay has opened up about why he dropped out of the university six months after gaining admission. The “Bad Influence” singer during an interview on ‘The 77 percent’ on Deutsche Welle (DW) said he was faced with the choice of remaining in school while struggling with the fees or going after mastering music production, which he was just learning at the time.

I just dropped out. Yeah, it was a hard choice to make because at that time I was just learning music production and I needed financing for school. I needed time for music production. “Somehow, I just loved music production so much I could let go of school for music production. I felt like maybe sometime I will come back but when I got really deep into music production, I didn’t go back to school, and I didn’t even have the time. “At some point, it felt like a wrong choice, but then, things started clicking; I started making beats that I love, that wowed people. “I started writing songs for people and people didn’t believe that that was me, and I just kept doing it until I found myself in Germany right now. I’m here right now, I’m doing this interview right now.”
