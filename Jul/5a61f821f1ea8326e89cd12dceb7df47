MOHAMED Salah has signed a new long-term contract at Liverpool, ending speculation that he could depart on a free transfer next summer. Along with Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane, who has since departed to Bayern Munich, Salah was the third member of Jurgen Klopp’s front line who was heading into the final 12 months of his deal but is now contracted to remain at Anfield until 2025. A reported salary of around £350,000 a week would put him far ahead of other top earners at the club, on a par with the Premier League’s top talent at Manchester City and Manchester United.
