Super Eagles striker Cyriel Dessers was left disappointed after Genk’s narrow 3-2 loss at champions Club Brugge in their opening match of the season. The Limburgers were faced with the arduous task of trading tackles with Jupiler League champions Club Brugge in their opening game of the season. The game lived up to the billing, as both teams were brilliant. Just like the hosts Club Brugge, Genk created a lot of chances, but only Dessers’ and Tresor Ndayishimiye’s strikes were good enough to beat Simon Mignolet in Club Brugge’s goal. However, the Belgian giants did one better than their visitors, as Skov Olsen nicked a brace, while Hans Vanaken added one to ensure a 3-2 win for Blauw-Zwart.

Nonetheless, he was unhappy with the result. “It was a typical Club Brugge match of ours,” Dessers told Voetbalkrant “We’ve been through it before; playing well and leaving empty-handed.” “The result is terrible, but we can also learn a lot from this. There is quality around here. If you can bring this against the title favorite you are doing well. I have already had fun.” Dessers would look to help the Limburgers return to winning ways when they lock horns with Standard Liege in their second game of the season next Sunday.
