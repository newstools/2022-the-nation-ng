Rangers legend Barry Ferguson thinks the Light Blues should do everything to keep Calvin Bassey at Ibrox and insists the Nigerian international’s performances last season left him in awe. Bassey has been linked with a number of clubs over the summer but Ferguson believes that another year at Ibrox will really help his development ahead of an inevitable move to the Premier League. The Super Eagles star has quickly become one of Rangers’ most important players and Ferguson is desperate to see him stick around in Glasgow a while longer.

Some of the performances he puts in and he’s still got a bit to learn, he’s still got a bit to go. “But he’s got everything you want as a modern-day defender. He can play a number of positions, he can play left-back, he can play left wing-back and he can play left of a three or left of a two. “His engine is frightening and he’s just getting better and better and better.”
