Vice President Yemi Osinbajo yesterday distanced himself from a memorandum stating that he had sought President Muhammadu Buhari’s approved to leave the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). The memorandum, dated June 24, 2022 and titled: Permission to Resign from APC, had listed, among others, family pressure, his (Osinbajo’s) continuous participation in active and partisan politics and membership of the APC as the reasons for his decision. But when asked to confirm the authenticity of the said memo, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity in the Office of the Vice President, Mr. Laolu Akande, described it as fake.   Buhari: ‘Something to remember me by’     Choosing to act     Double jeopardy? Just as well!   Laolu said the language of the author of the memo is not that of Vice President Osinbajo, explaining that his boss would not write a memo so full of errors. “Where do you people even get these things from? Who gave it to you? Anyways, for the avoidance of doubt, the memo is fake. VP didn’t write any such thing,” he said. Also, the “fake memorandum” that was purportedly written and signed by Professor Osinbajo, had read: “I have the honour to inform you that for some time now, I have been having series of meetings and pressure from my immediate family members on some matters. One of the issues borders on my continuous participation on active and partisan politics, and by extension, my continuous membership of our party, the All Progressives Congress (APC). “As a father and great member, whom without you, I would not be where I am today, regrettably, I write to seek your permission to resign my membership of the APC. However, if the timing of this plan is not convenient or acceptable by Your Excellency, I will surely abide by your decision and advice, which I will consider to be the final.  “Please, accept the assurances of my highest regards and loyalty.”
