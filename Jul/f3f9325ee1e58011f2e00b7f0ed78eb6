People are quarreling, you use the right music. Sometimes you even sing songs for affection, to cool nerves. You can also use music to heighten war but that is not what we are propagating here. We want to live in peace and harmony, and music can achieve that.

Take it or leave it, Nigerians are known for celebrations, why do you want to think of war, when we should be celebrating all our lives.”
