Rangers hero Alfredo Morelos has sent a message to Leon Balogun with the Nigerian defender leaving the club on a free transfer this summer. The Colombian is currently working his way back to fitness but has revealed he will miss Balogun, who was allowed to leave the club at the end of his contract. Balogun had hoped to stay at Ibrox after admitting he had fallen in love with Rangers during his two seasons in Glasgow but the club decided against handing him a new deal despite initial talks to hold onto him.

Balogun and Morelos had linked up over the weekend and the Colombian took to social media to send a message to his pal. The pair appear to have built up a strong relationship over the last couple of successful seasons for Rangers that saw them win the league and then reach the Europa League Final this season. Morelos posted a picture of both of them and said: “My brother, I will miss you so much.”
