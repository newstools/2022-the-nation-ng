Absence of social media celebrity, Ismaila Mustapha aka Mompha, for the third time, stalled his trial before Justice Mojisola Dada of an Ikeja Special Offences Court yesterday. Justice  Dada had on June 22 revoked the bail granted the defendant and issued a bench warrant for his arrest following his absence in court. Mompha was also absent in court on June 16, thereby stalling his trial. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) had arraigned Mustapha and his company, Ismalob Global Investment Limited on an eight-count charge of N6b money  laundering offence. EFCC prosecutor, Rotimi Oyedepo on June 10, EFCC had told the court that the defendant flouted the  court’s order by travelling to Dubai with a new  international passport.

Defence counsel,  Kolawole Salami, also  prayed the court for an extension of time to bring the defendant back to court. “My lord, we are working with the prosecution to make sure that the defendant is brought back to court.

The EFCC had charged  Mustapha for conspiracy to launder money obtained through unlawful activities, and laundering of money obtained through unlawful activities. The eight count  charge bordered on retention of proceeds of criminal conduct, use of property derived from an unlawful act, possession of a document containing false pretenses and failure to disclose assets among others.
