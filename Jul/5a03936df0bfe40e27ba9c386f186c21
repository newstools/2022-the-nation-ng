They form part of the 12,581 delegates selected from across the globe to attend the conference ending on August 2. AIDS 2022 follows the pre-conference meetings from July 27 to 28.

AIDS 2022, according to the organisers, will call on the world to come together to re-engage and follow the science. “AIDS 2022, the world’s largest conference on HIV and AIDS, will convene leading scientists, policymakers and grassroots activists to apply lessons learned from decades of pandemic response. “It will define future research agendas, shift latest evidence to action, and chart a new consensus on overcoming the HIV epidemic as a threat to public health and individual well-being,” noted IAS. The conference will be succeeded by the 12th IAS Conference on HIV Science (IAS 2023) taking place in Brisbane, Australia, and virtually from July 23 to 26, 2023.
