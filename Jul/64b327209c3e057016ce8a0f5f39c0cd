Odowgu, who just unveiled sixth album ‘Love Damini’, in a podcast with Zane Lowe on Apple Music 1, said he is not naturally drawn to politics.  He said he has also decided not to be involved in politics and its many trickery to the point of turning down mouth-watering offers greater men wouldn’t have resisted.

So that’s who we should be looking up to. Everything else is going to be flawed. “So for me, that’s why I stick to music, and I don’t really… At this point, I feel like I’ve seen all there to see about the realities and everything,” he said.
