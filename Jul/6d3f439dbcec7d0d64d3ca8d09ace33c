Led by the member of the House of Representatives representing Ibarapa Central/Ibarapa North Federal constituency, Muraina Ajibola, the defectors were received by the APC Chairman Isaac Omodewu, Oyo South Senatorial candidate Sarafadeen Alli and other party leaders.

Omodewu said he has been appealing to aggrieved party members and his appeal is yielding good result. He welcomed the defectors, saying they will work together to defeat the PDP-led government. He added: “We are here to ensure that we unite our people. We have been appealing to these people to stay in their home that they have nothing to do outside the party when we are working hard to return to the Agodi Government House in 2023. “For those contemplating going to other parties, there is no place like home. Let them stay in their house. As the state party chairman, I will continue to appeal to them to stay. If you see what is going in here today, you will see the need to unify our people. Our chances in the 2023 election are very bright and that is why our primaries were very tense.”
