One of the freed kidnapped victims of the Abuja-Kaduna train attack, Hassan Uthman, has recalled his ordeals in captivity. He said the terrorists thoroughly beat them, declaring pity for those still captivity. Speaking in an interview with the BBC Hausa, Uthman thanked Almighty Allah for regaining freedom. He said last Friday their relations attempted to rescue them but the government did not allow them to proceed on the journey. He said the relations made a second attempt on Monday and were successful in rescuing three of them from captivity.

It has failed to rescue us. ” I don’t know whether ransom was paid to rescue us,” he said. He recalled that they were initially sleeping on the bare ground in the thick forest before they were provided with mats. “When the rain started, they erected makeshift shelters for us. They fed us according to their capacity. At times, they even slaughtered cattle and sheep for us. Even yesterday they slaughtered a cow and we ate; we thank Allah. “Because of the government’s attitude, they were angered and they thoroughly beat us. We were severely flogged and that was just the beginning. This makes me to pity those that are still with them in the forest,” he said. He said he couldn’t locate the forest they were taken, adding that since the Federal Government had failed to rescue them for the past four months, the international community should rescue the remaining victims in pitiable condition in the forest.
