Joe Aribo said  he was comfortable at Southampton already after his summer transfer from Rangers. The Nigerian international made the move to join Southampton earlier this month, becoming the fifth summer signing to date for Saints, who have also welcomed goalkeepers Gavin Bazunu and Mateusz Lis, along with German defender Armel Bella-Kotchap and Belgian midfielder Romeo Lavia. Aribo has been away with his new team-mates in Austria this week as Southampton continue their build up to the new Premier League season, with the 25-year-old making his first appearance for the Saints as they faced German Bundesliga side RB Leipzig at the Lavanttal-Arena in Wolfsberg on Saturday.

But ahead of a second friendly against SK Austria Klagenfurt on Monday, Aribo spoke of how beneficial the time away in Austria has been for him as he gets used to his new team-mates. “I’ve settled in very well. The boys have been really welcoming and that’s important to have, they have helped me to settle and be comfortable and be myself, and I’ve really enjoyed it,” he told the club’s website. “It’s very important for us to know what our team-mates strengths are, what they like to do and what their habits are on the pitch. That’s the way we are going to get the best out of each other, when we are gelling on the pitch and in full flow.” Aribo will be hoping to get more game time under his belt before Southampton head back to England, where they will face Watford, AS Monaco and Villarreal in the coming fortnight before the Premier League season begins on Saturday, August 6 when Saints travel to north London to face Tottenham.
