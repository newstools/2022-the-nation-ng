NIGERIA international Samuel Chukwueze came off the bench to score and help Villarreal defeat Borrusia Dortmund 2-0 in a pre-season friendly on Friday. The 23-year-old has missed the opening two pre-season matches but was introduced in the 60th minute as the Yellow Submarine cruised to victory courtesy of his goal and that of Gerard Moreno at CASHPOINT Arena in Austria.

Against Dortmund, manager Unai Emery once again did not start the Super Eagle, but they looked the bright side from the onset as they should have taken the lead in the 12th minute when Francis Coquelin’s glancing header hit the woodwork and bounced out for a goal-kick. In the 34th minute, Coquelin combined well with Alex Baena before setting up Moreno, but his decision to hold onto the ball despite being in a position to score, saw Dortmund’s Thomas Meunier clear the danger.
