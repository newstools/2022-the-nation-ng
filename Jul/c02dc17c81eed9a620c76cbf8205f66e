The former Senator representing Kogi West, Dino Melaye, has given reasons on why he believes the Labour Party (LP) presidential candidate Peter Obi cannot win the 2023 presidential election. He stated that Obi’s agenda to cut cost of governance as he has listened to in Obi’s campaigns is not as important as unifying the country’s ethnic groups. In the video shared on his verified social media platforms and seen by The Nation, Dino advised Obi to wait for his time. He said: “Peter Obi is one of the finest Nigerians who is intellectually mobile, and administratively sagacious, a great Nigerian and has a great potential of being Nigeria’s president in the nearest future.   Row over Peter Obi’s campaign posters on Muslim prayer…     Police deploy over 13,000 officers for AU/UN, ECOWAS…     Doctors, dentists reject bill to amend University Teaching…   “I celebrate you Peter Obi, and I celebrate your movement. I celebrate your conscientisation of the Nigerian youth and the public on governance. “But I want to advise, your time is not now because you’ve to wait for your time. I’ve listened to your postulations. I’ve listened to your arguments, deliveries and campaigns, and 90% of your campaign is dwelling on reducing the cost of governance. “The problem of this country is beyond just cutting the cost of governance… You don’t need to become governance before you can cut the cost of governance. If you’ve a very effective Minister of Finance, budget and planning, CBN governor and chairman of the Economic team, you can cut governance with the operation of the president. “What we need today in Nigeria is to unify this country. The country is so much divided.. There’s no trust between the North and the South.”
