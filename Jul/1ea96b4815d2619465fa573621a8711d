Leicester City coach Brendan Rodgers has explained that midfielder Wilfred sustained an ankle injury during training. However, he believes the Super Eagles star would return to action soon. Ndidi missed a chunk of last season after sustaining a knee injury in the Foxes’ UEFA Conference League loss to Rennes in March. The former Genk man missed Leicester City’s last 16 matches of the season. Nonetheless, Ndidi returned to full training with the former Premier League champions earlier this month. Unfortunately for the Nigerian midfielder, he sustained another injury, with reports claiming that he twisted his ankle.

We don’t think it’s too serious. “It’s a high ankle sprain, so he had a scan on it and it’ll hopefully be okay. We’ve just looked after him really, he won’t be involved at the weekend. But of course, hopefully, next week at some point he’ll be back training.” Leicester City have four more games lined up for preseason, and Ndidi could miss some of the games. But Rodgers would want him to be at his best when the Foxes begin their Premier League campaign on August 7th .
