On-air-personality, Damilola Banire, has urged celebrities to ignore troublesome fans who may want to taint their public image. He spoke against the backdrop of Actor Taiwo Hassan (Ogogo’s) brawl with a fan some weeks ago. According to Hassan, the fan and others demanded he pays them a sum he could not afford. Despite giving them all the money he had, the said fan then proceeded to drag him with his attire and this got him angry and a brawl ensued. However, Banire said celebrities should remain calm in tense situations because some fans want unnecessary attention.

However, sometimes fans could be overbearing and we have also seen situations where fans fight celebs or bully you just to get your attention but in all, silence is golden.” On whether a celebrity’s image is tainted when he loses his head, she said: “Depending on what the person is losing it for or about, Eg, if you are flaring up to protect your right and sanity it will only take a while such matters will fade, but if in situations like infidelity, fake life or some other misconduct; yes they might get tainted, but overall I think in whatever situation, who loves you as a fan might not be deterred if you lose your head or not, the love is intact.” Banire advised celebrities to be diplomatic in handling overbearing fans. ” The word overbearing is on the edge already, diplomacy is very important and they [celebrities] should learn to put some deaf eyes and ignore,” she said. On advice for fans with a sense of entitlement, she said: “Not only fans in most cases, people generally! Everybody has been given his own life, nobody owes you anything. If you need something from someone, ask respectfully. If they decline because of unexplainable situations, move on in peace! Nobody is is in this life because of you.”
