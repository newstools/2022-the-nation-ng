Music promoter Sam Larry has denied claims by self-styled ‘wahala’ singer, Habeeb Okikiola, aka Portable that he is aware he (Portable) founded well-known cult groups Ajah boys and One Million Boys which terrorised Lagos State residents. The popular music promoter, speaking in Yoruba, refuted Portable’s claim in a 58-second video that was viral on social media. Sam Larry said he just assisted Portable with his trip because he is a music promoter. “I had that something is happening on social media about One Million Boys. I don’t know anything about them and I don’t know them. Portable who mentioned my name, I am his benefactor. I helped him to travel because am a promoter. “When did I know you? It is not up to a year now. I am your benefactor and you are using that to tannish my image. You did not mention my name alone but on Social media everyone is there mentioning my name. Where did we meet for One Million Boys? What is the meaning of that? Don’t ever mention my name on something bad.

Please correct yourself because I don’t know you,” he added. On one side of the video was Portables chat with him apologising to the music promoter describing his action as “cruise”.
