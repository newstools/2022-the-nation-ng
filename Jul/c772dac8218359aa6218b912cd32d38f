The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday accused the All Progressives Congress (APC) of “importing” armed thugs into the state ahead of Saturday’s governorship poll. PDP state chairman, Dr. Akindele Adekunle, said in a statement: “We are in possession of reliable reports of political thugs mobilised by the APC now arriving in various parts of Osun State. “The is witnessing an influx of armed men and women whose sole goal is to violently disrupt the peaceful conduct of the election.   2023: North West APC backs Tinubu-Shettima’s ticket     Pan African Farmers Organisation appoints Nigerian CEO     Banditry: Extend security forces’ retirement age,…   “We charge the newly deployed Police Election Commissioner and the Deputy Inspector General’s of Police posted to Osun to take judicious note and urgently act to arrest the situation. “The security agencies should not wait until citizens resort to self-help before the menace of party thugs is nipped in the bud.” But the APC state campaign council spokesperson, Sunday Akere, described the allegation as laughable and a sign that the party anticipates failure. “We are focused on the goal, which is winning the Saturday poll by mobilising residents to throng voting units and cast their votes consciously for Governor Gboyega Oyetola. “We can’t engage the PDP in a mud fight,” he said.
