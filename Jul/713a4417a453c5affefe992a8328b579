The nationwide protest by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) in solidarity with the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) took another dimension Tuesday in Anambra State when both unions clashed. ASUU members labelled NLC leadership as incompetent following the short protest that didn’t last more than 20 minutes. But Anambra NLC chairperson, Mrs Chinwe Orizu, appealed to the ASUU members to stop what they were doing, describing it as a distraction to the main protest. The Nation gathered the protest was cut short, following an appeal from Governor Chukwuma Soludo.

But a calm Ngozi Unogu said the noise by both bodies was not necessary, stating it had not captured the essence of the protest. For Chris Azor, the Chairman of Civil Society Organizations CSOs in Anambra State, the protest had been captured and people should be allowed to go home instead of trying to cause trouble. Security operatives were positioned at strategic positions at Aroma to Dr Alex Ekwueme square, the venue of the rally. The NLC members marched from the square to Aroma and blocked the Enugu -Onitsha expressway for about five minutes, while motorists were a bit stranded within the short moment.
