Actor Yomi Fabiyi’s estranged lover and son’s mother, Grace Jimoh, has cancelled every curse placed on their child by comedienne Princess. The mother, who welcomed a son, Korede with the movie maker in February replaced the pronounced curses with blessings. After Baba Ijesha was sentenced to 16 years imprisonment by Justice Oluwatoyin Taiwo of the Ikeja Domestic Violence and Sexual Offences Court on Thursday, Princess, whose foster child was the victim of sexual molestation by the actor, cursed individuals who took sides with the convicted actor, especially Yomi Fabiyi. The comedienne cursed not just the individuals but also their offsprings.

As I place my child in your mighty loving hands, give him peace, AKOREDE, you will excel in life, you are protected in God’s hand. No curse, no evil will befall you. Amen”, she wrote. In another post, the mother of one slammed Princess for raining curses on innocent children rather than simply celebrate her victory and curse her offenders According to Jimoh:”If you (Princess) had gone through labour pain, you would know cursing an innocent child/ren is a no. “There are some children that naturally have ‘back to sender’ spirit. “Curse whosoever that offended you. This children are innocent!!! God made you win. He do no evil.”
