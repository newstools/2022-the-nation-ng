Super Falcons coach Randy Waldrum remains upbeat despite his side’s disappointing start at the 12th on-going 2022 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations (WAFCON) in Morocco following the opening 2-1 loss to South Africa on Monday. “We knew it would be a difficult game, it is the first game of the tournament and it is a long tournament. We have to prepare for the next games,” Waldrum said.“I was surprised with our performance in the attack. We got a late goal and we tried to get back in the game, we are still positive. “I am looking forward to how we can improve, we will look at the areas we were exposed and we will make those corrections. “We can’t panic at this period, we still have two group games and we have to improve.

Meanwhile, defender Ashleigh Plumptre has urged her teammates to brace up ahead of tomorrow’s fixture against Botswana in Morocco. The Leicester City central defender who featured as a left back in the 2-1 defeat to Bayana Bayana said she was happy to play anywhere for the team though playing in the central defence remains her ideal position. “I prefer to play at centre-back, but I will give 100% anywhere the coach plays me,” Plumptre stated. “It is frustrating to give 100% in the game while one or two aren’t giving their best.”
