Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly Mudashiru Obasa has said the House will continue to make laws to ensure the safety of lives and property. According to him, Lagos remains the relatively safest part of Nigeria because of conscious steps by successive administrations since 1999. Obasa, in his congratulatory message to Muslims on the 2022 Eid-El-Kabir, noted that the celebration affords Muslims a conscious effort to show love, sacrifice for one another and ensure a peaceful environment that should continue even after the period. The speaker stressed that the peace enjoyed by Lagos residents and investors is a result of the passion of those in government to make the state habitable at all times.

With all the arms of government working together, we have achieved great feats in the area of security. “Your representatives at the House of Assembly have never shied away from the task of making our dear state attractive and better for its residents. We have made laws and passed resolutions that have helped in this regard. “The creation of the Neighbourhood Safety Corps and other related agencies, the anti-kidnapping and the anti-cultism laws which prescribe serious punishments, as well as our review of the criminal justice law of the state, are perfect examples of our resolve to always ensure pro-people activities. “We are encouraged by the feedbacks we constantly receive from residents of our state and our colleagues in many parts of Africa. We will continue to make Lagos a success.” Obasa, who thanked the people for being tolerant of one another irrespective of individual beliefs, urged them not to relent in spreading love.
