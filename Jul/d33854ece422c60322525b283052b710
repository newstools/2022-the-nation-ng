Arsenal have completed the signing of versatile Ukraine midfielder Oleksandr Zinchenko from Manchester City. The 25-year-old flew back from City’s pre-season tour of the USA to complete the move after Arsenal agreed to a £30m deal, which includes £2m in add-ons. He has signed a long-term contract with the London club and is their fifth signing of the summer. “Alex is a high-quality player who will give us options and versatility,” boss Mikel Arteta said.
