In Sterling’s seven years at City, he has scored 131 goals in 339 appearances for the reigning Premier League champions. He joined City from Liverpool for an initial £44 million in July 2015 and has gone on to win four Premier League titles, one FA Cup and three League Cups. Erling Haaland and Julian Alvarez’s arrivals, plus the form of the likes of Phil Foden, Jack Grealish and Riyad Mahrez, has meant there will be fierce competition for places in Pep Guardiola’s starting XI next season. City’s first game of the 2022-23 season will be against West Ham United at the London Stadium on August 7.
