Nigerian superstar singer, songwriter, and producer Simi has revealed the reason behind the three years break before her 4th solo album entitled TBH (To Be Honest). The mother of one, in  an interview with Ehis Dadaboy on shoppingmode Apple Music Now Radio, said the delay before the release of the 11-track project was occasioned by the sound she was seeking. She said, “It took me almost 3 years, from the conception of the idea to the actual release of the album.”   Shoot Your Shot: Chef Sommy cooks up date to win crush’s…     I married who I wasn’t supposed to marry, says Kas Beats     Why I’m different from other musicians, says Berri-Tiga   Continuing, she said, “It was the sound. I had the idea from the  beginning, I knew what I wanted to say but  for me, I think the hardest part was “How do I want to say it? What sounds do I want to go with, or not want to go with?” The ‘Duduke’ singer also disclosed that she did a lot of writing, removing, and adding to ensure she got the sound she was seeking. “I did loads of writing and removing and adding, mostly because of the sound I was going for. There are lots of songs that also fit the idea but not the sound I was looking  for, so just all of that I think was the hardest part.” On  the sound which delayed her album for three years,  she said, “It’s just really chill. It’s music you can drive to, the music you can chill to, the music you can  romance to. I just let  my voice do a lot of  the work – my writing here is  more in-your-face and more daring. It’s just more modern. I listen to this album and think “Damn, I did that,” so I’m really excited for people to hear it.”
