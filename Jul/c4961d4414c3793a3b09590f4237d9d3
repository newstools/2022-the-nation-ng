Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has landed at the Port Harcourt International Airport after his vacation in Turkey amid turbulence in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Wike returned to the state on Saturday afternoon accompanied by his Abia State counterpart, Okezie Ikpeazu, who also spent his vacation in Turkey. Wike’s absence and his silence over how his party’s Presidential Candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, mistreated him in the selection of his running mate for the 2023 election, had caused crisis in the PDP.

Stakeholders in Rivers PDP were said to be waiting for Wike’s directive to know their next line of action. Wike’s return on Saturday also coincided with the coming home of his main political rival and leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Rotimi Amaechi, to Rivers.
