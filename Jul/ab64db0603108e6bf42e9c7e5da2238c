The enforcement team of Lagos State Physical Planning Permit Authority (LASPPPA) has cracked down on an illegal shopping complex being developed at Alade Market, Ikeja. General Manager of LASPPPA Kehinde Osinaike, who led the team, decried the disregard for planning laws among developers. He said the developer failed to regularise the construction and obtain permits as well as building approvals. Osinaike noted that ‘’despite sealing off the property three times due to lack of planning permit, the developer broke government seal and continued construction in disregard to the physical planning laws of the state.”   Police recruitment based on merit, not politics,…     Buhari celebrates Amusan, Brume over World Athletics feats     FCT taskforce begins massive demolition of…   Osinaike also noted that the agency discovered that the developer handling Alade Market project is in charge of another unapproved structure  (Triangles Mall), Osapa London at Lekki-Epe Expressway. He said although he was served contravention notices requesting him and others to comply, yet he refused to stop work at the Triangles Mall. The LASPPPA chief said  the authority would enforce its mandate of ensuring that physical structures were built in tandem with permit laws enshrined to guarantee safety of life, property and well being of Lagosians. The team also visited Ogudu and Agboyi- Ketu areas of the state and sealed off some property contravening planning permit laws. They had earlier been served notices to comply but failed to do so.
