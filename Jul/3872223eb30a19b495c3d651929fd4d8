Aside from dominating the opening quarter, the Super Falcons had numerous scoring chances, their greatest undoing was failing to convert. Two minutes before the half-hour mark, the reigning African champions paid for their unpardonable misses when ZISD Queens midfielder Katongo put Bruce Mwape’s team ahead. After running through the right side of Nigeria’s backline, Tembo skipped past Michelle Alozie before sending the ball inside the goal area. Christy Ucheibe’s inability to clear the ball ensured that Katongo drilled a shot from a long-range shot – with the ball ricocheting the crossbar and then Nnadozie before rolling into the net. That goal was a reality check for Waldrum’s women, nonetheless, they were unable to restore parity.
