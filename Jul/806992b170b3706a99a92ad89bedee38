Afrobeats sensation J’ray believes the globally celebrated African music genre, Afrobeats, has room for expansion, especially to South America. South America is predominantly occupied by about 17 Spanish, Portuguese and French-speaking countries and independent territories such as Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador and Paraguay among others. The Latin American continent has popularised music cultures such as Salsa, Tango and Samba. It has also been influenced by American pop culture, which has given rise to latin pop, rock, hip hop, jazz and reggaeton among others. Reflecting on the expansion of the wave-making genre, the singer whose real name is Morojuoluwa Oke said: “Afrobeats gets even bigger day by day to no surprise. I am actually surprised it took this long for the whole world to catch up on it to be honest. “We have done a lot of good things, you know, featuring some artistes out here in the US, touring different continents, and gaining some airplay in different parts of the world.”   I look like old retired ‘prostitute’ on Android…     I’m proudly gay, says actor Maduagwu     I’m working on collabo with Burna Boy, Tu Face, Wizkid…   J’ray continued: “I believe if we keep going with everything we have done so far, the sky is the limit. I’d definitely love to see more collaborations from artistes in the South Americas, I think this is a big market to tap further into.” Still riding on the success of ‘Dance,’ his last release, the music-cum-tech whizz believes he can upend the status quo with his upcoming release to deliver what may turn out to be the summer hit of the year. “There is always something cooking in J’ray’s studio, literally. “Whenever I am not coding my life away, I am making beats or at least recording on one. “After the release of Dance video, I will be putting out one of the biggest songs of the summer so definitely look forward to that,” he added.
