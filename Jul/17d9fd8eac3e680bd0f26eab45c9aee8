Responding, Flavour N’abania affirmed he was familiar with the show while expressing deep regret for what Kimberly and others pass through in the hands of scammers who pose as him. Flavour said: “No, no, no! I don’t know her. I’ve experienced stuff like this. I’ve been to shows where I get fans bumped into me. And they be like, “You know me?” and I’ll be like, “I don’t!” “I feel bad because I don’t want anybody going through this kind of trauma because of me. All my accounts are verified. I don’t give out my personal information, I don’t talk to nothing, I don’t ask for money; that’s it for me.”
