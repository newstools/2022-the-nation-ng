The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) North-East treasurer Hon. Galadima Abba Itas has dumped the party over what he described as the ‘unjust treatment’ to Rivers Governor Nyesom Wike, during and after the presidential primary convention. He faulted the choice of Delta Governor Ifeanyi Okowa as running mate to PDP presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar, saying it contradicts the principles and ideologies of the party. In the letter of resignation addressed to the Ward Chairman, Itas Gadau Local Government Area, Bauchi State on Tuesday, Itas said the current situation in the party does not inspire confidence, adding the PDP is not ready to regain power in 2023.
