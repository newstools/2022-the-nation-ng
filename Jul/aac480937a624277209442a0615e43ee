Spanish giants Barcelona confirmed on Thursday an “agreement in principle” with Sevilla for the signing of 23-year-old French center-back Jules Koundé on a permanent transfer, pending a medical to make the deal official. Koundé’s signing comes after a long bidding war between Barça and Chelsea, who last Thursday reached an agreement with Sevilla on a deal worth over €60 million but were never given the green light to make the transfer official. Koundé’s priority was always Barça, and the Catalans finally acted over the last few days and presented a formal offer.
