Residents of OPIC Estate and Greenfield Estate in Isheri North area of Ogun State have petitioned the state government seeking to reverse what they termed “the violation of building regulations in the Estate”. In the petition addressed to the Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development, the residents claimed that the alleged violators were making “attempts to defeat and rubbish” the Ministry’s “vision, mission and policy thrust”. The petition signed by the residents’ association’s chair, Ayo Balogun, and secretary, Ayoola Oladapo, said there was “urgent need” to prevent the potential health hazards which the alleged violation poses to the residents. The Association also claimed that despite several meetings with one Olugbenga Arowolo, he was “feverishly building a school on Ayo Balogun Avenue instead of a block of residential flats for which approval was granted by the State Government”.

Three other persons were also accused of building regulation infractions. One of them allegedly owns an oven-baked car factory, which, the petitioners claimed, uses chemicals that “may prove lethal to the health of the residents”, while another is allegedly converting a two-storey building to accommodate many flats but “without adequate parking space for residents and occupants. The residents said despite their approved litigation plan, they opted to exhaust the window of the petition in the hope that the alleged violations would be halted and reversed. Attempts made over days to get Mr Arowolo’s response to the allegations were fruitless. At a point he said he was driving and would call back. He never did.
