Imagine me seeing someone recording himself or herself coming to my father’s house for condolence. I would have destroyed that camera. “Let’s all be emotionally sensitive, emotionally involved, and emotionally genuine not everything is content. If you are really touched, if it is not a publicly sighting for you, you will not have the mind to tell your PA to hold the camera. As I’m walking in be recording, record everybody, as she’s crying record her. Then you sat, edited, and even put the soundtrack. No, it’s offensive. Clout is good for business but this one is not nice.”
