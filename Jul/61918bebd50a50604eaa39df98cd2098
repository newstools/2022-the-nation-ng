Cristiano Ronaldo has rejected a lucrative offer from an unnamed Saudi Arabian club, according to reports. The Portuguese forward is desperate to leave Manchester United this summer, but doesn’t want to move away from European football. Reports this week claimed that Ronaldo was offered an eye watering two-year contract worth a total £211million by a Saudi side – working out at £2m a week. According to ESPN, CR7 has rejected the offer. The Saudi side would have paid United £25m for their 37-year-old star.
