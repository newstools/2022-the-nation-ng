Joe Aribo has expressed his excitement for Calvin Bassey after he sealed his move to Ajax. The pair were teammates at Rangers and have formed a close bond over the past few seasons. They also feature together at the international level for Nigeria. Bassey signed a five-year deal with Ajax following his €27million switch. Aribo has also left Ibrox this summer, with Southampton snapping up the talented attacking midfielder in a deal potentially worth up to £10m. And the 25-year-old says Bassey richly deserves his move. He told talkSPORT: “I speak to him a lot. He’s very happy with the move.

He’s really excited.” In the first month of the new season, Saints face both Manchester United and Southampton at home. Aribo was asked if that was a daunting prospect or something to be excited about. He replied: “I feel excited. I’m not really a nervous player anymore. I used to be at times, but now I just embrace the moment and the occasion. I can’t wait to get going. “I play as a No.10 or an eight. I just want to get involved in the play, be on the ball, and help drive us up the pitch. “We want to push and fight this season. We want to finish in the top half of the table and push for Europe. That’s the aim. “We’ll try out best and do what we can as a team because we’re on a good journey here, I’m excited for what’s to come.”
