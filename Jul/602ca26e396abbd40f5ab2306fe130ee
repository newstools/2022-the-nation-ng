Lagos State government yesterday launched an app to curtail incesant building collapse. Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Physical Planning and Urban Development, Abiola Kosegbe, an engineer, stated this on television over the weekend. She said through this measure, stakeholders, including property owners and developers, would have the opportunity to view Planning Permits issued monthly, which will include the type of use and number of floors, among others. She further stated that stakeholders would also be able to monitor for compliance, particularly with respect to type of use and number of units, while urging them to notify authorities quickly if the construction was deviating from approval.

She said: “As such, the regular display of all Planning Permits issued on our mobile app, will serve as a guide, provide the information and discourage illegal physical developments, while  fast-tracking the achievement of a sustainable Lagos as envisaged by the THEMES Agenda.” She stated that a list of distressed and abandoned buildings would also be uploaded on the app. According to her, the development was part of the State Government initiative to enhance service delivery and ensure that members of the public continue to receive the dividends of democracy.
