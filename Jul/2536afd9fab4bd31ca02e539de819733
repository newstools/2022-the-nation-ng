Kunle Afolayan’s award-winning 2020 film “Citation“, has clinched its first award on the international scene. The movie bagged the ‘Best International Film’ at the just-concluded National Film Awards sponsored by Rosa Faizzad in the United Kingdom. In a post shared on his Instagram page, Afolayan announced the feat, revealing it came as a surprise because ‘the director and the entire production team didn’t see the award coming and are grateful for the support and recognition of the public and the organisers’. He stressed he is glad the movie got recognised without having to lobby for it. Afolayan shared his excitement as the film’s lead casts Haitan actor, Jimmy Jean Louis and Temi Otedola received the award. The movie, which is broadly based on real-life events, tells the story of a bright student, Moremi (role played by Temi Otedola), who speaks out against her lecturer, a professor (Jimmy Jean Louis) after he sexually assaults her.
