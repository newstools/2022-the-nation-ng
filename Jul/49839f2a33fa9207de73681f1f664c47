Continuing, TeeA said, “What we are hoping to achieve is just a celebration of authentic Nigerian R ‘n’ B sounds. Almost every music has an R ‘n’ B background or influence and Afrobeats is not an exception. A lot of today’s music has a very strong R ‘n’ Binfluence in it.” TeeA believes Nigeria’s entertainment industry has grown over the years with Nigerian music traveling globally at the moment and it is important to showcase the sounds even to the audience back home. “The entertainment industry in Nigeria has evolved rapidly over the years with a substantial amount of it now being exported across the globe. It is therefore important to give music fans at home an event to remember annually,” he concluded.
