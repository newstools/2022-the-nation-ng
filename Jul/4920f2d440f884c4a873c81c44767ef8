NIGERIA midfielder Ngozi Okobi-Okeoghene says the weight of history meant the record nine-time Women’s Africa Cup of Nations (WAFCON) winners had to get their finals campaign back on track. The Super Falcons outclassed a stubborn Botswana side 2-0 on Thursday to claim their first Group C victory in Morocco. “We needed to come back because, for us, this [tournament] is our birth-right or something,” Okobi-Okeoghene told BBC Sport Africa. “We can’t just afford to lose this whole thing just like that.

Everyone wants to beat Nigeria so we have to work extra. We still have to work more, especially on our finishing.” Meanwhile, Head Coach of Super Falcons, Randy Waldrum has apologized for his statement at Thursday’s post-match conference at which he dropped an unsavoury comment about the Nigeria media. The gaffer had mentioned something about the Nigeria media being ‘negative’ but the Nigeria Football Federation had immediately called him to order, saying the statement was uncomplimentary against an institution that is the most vibrant on the African continent, in terms of structure and performance. “The comments are regrettable and I withdraw them in entirety. Actually, I will say the statement did not come out the way I intended. I hold the media everywhere, including Nigeria, in high regard and I only wish they could be a little more empathetic to us when we lose or draw matches.
