For the fourth episode of Shoot your shot love show, Chef Sommy Jordan hoped to cook up the perfect date to win her crush’s heart, Kieran. The beautiful chef decided to seek the help of the show’s team to help set the perfect date to win Kieran’s heart. Sommy met with Bisola to help her plan the ideal date to court Kieran going on the hunch that he reciprocated her feelings. She shared that they met at the gym and started the conversation by advertising her cooking business. While Sommy likes to cook, Kieran likes to write, thus earning his living as a full-time writer.   I married who I wasn’t supposed to marry, says Kas Beats     Why I’m different from other musicians, says Berri-Tiga     Mr Macaroni partners with Molara Foundation to award…   The conversation with Sommy was pleasant, and the same was true of Bisola’s chat with Kieran. But before asking personal questions, Bisola asked the writer whether he thought a secret admirer appearing on TV to woo him was a sign of desperation or dedication. Sadly, he perceived it as a desperate move. Kieran described his ideal partner as someone who has a great sense of understanding, hardworking, God-fearing and attentive. To further woo his heart, Sommy set up a paint and sip date, and he couldn’t have been more impressed. During the date, Sommy asked that they draw something for each other. While Kieran stuck to the plan and drew a version of Sommy – as best as his non-artistic hands could, Sommy painted out the words, “ Will you be my boyfriend?” leaving him completely speechless. Sadly, hearts didn’t fly in the air as Kieran said an emphatic no to Sommy’s question. He told her he wasn’t ready to dive into a new relationship but would like to remain friends with Sommy.
