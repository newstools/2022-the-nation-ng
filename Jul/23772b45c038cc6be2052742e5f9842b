The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has disclosed that 378,639 of the 1,761,338 who wrote the 2022 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examinations scored 200 and above. The examinations, which were conducted in 750 CBT centres approved by the Board, ended on May 13, 2022. Registrar of JAMB, Prof Is-haq Oloyede disclosed this while making a presentation during the 2022 policy meeting in Abuja. The policy meeting, chaired by Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, kick-starts admission activities in tertiary institutions. The board adopted the cut-off marks of 140 for universities, 120 for polytechnics and 100 for colleges of education as recommended by stakeholders during the policy meeting. The decision was arrived at after a heated session comprising officials from JAMB, the Ministry of Education, the National Universities Commission, the National Board for Technical Education, Vice Chancellors, Rectors, Provost, among others. However, this year’s admission process may be delayed as a result of the ongoing strike by the university-based unions in the country. The meeting, however, resolved that December 31 would be the deadline for 2022 admissions into all public institutions and private institutions across the country for universities, polytechnics and Colleges of Education. While giving the breakdown of the 2022 examination, Oloyede noted that 378,639 scored above 200; a total of 520,596 candidates scored 190 and above; 704,991 scored 180 and above; 934,103 scored 170 and above; 1,192, 057 scored 160 and above.

Adebayo wrote the examination in one of the computer-based test centres in Abuja. According to a presentation by Prof Oloyede, Adebayo was closely followed by Ugwu Chikelu, an indigene of Enugu state with a score of 359. Like Adebayo, Ugwu also wrote the UTME in Abuja. Other high scorers include Igbalaye Ebunoluwa 357; Emmanuel Oluwanifemi 357; Ozumba Samuel 357; Olumide-Attah Ayomide 355; Lawal Olaoluwa 355; Dokun Jubril 354; Amaku Anthony 354 and Aghulor Divine 353. Speaking further, Oloyede noted that the board allowed candidates with awaiting results to register for the 2022 UTME. “JAMB allowed awaiting results candidates to register and sit for the 2022 UTME. These candidates can’t be considered for admission on awaiting result status. They must present their O’level results on the board’s portal before the commencement of admissions.” The Minister advised tertiary institutions to adopt a more flexible posture in the admissions process provided all actions were in compliance with the guidelines. “Just as in the previous admissions exercises, the admissions criteria still remain as approved and circulated. “All institutions must therefore adhere strictly to them and all others prescribed by the regulatory bodies such as the National Universities Commission (NUC), National Board for Technical Education (NBTE) and the National Commission for Colleges of Education (NCCE). “This is particularly with regards to approved quotas, ratios and other specifications meant for improved quality, accountability and equity,” he said.
