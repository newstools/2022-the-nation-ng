The news came in while this column was done, but I squeeze my support of Kashim Shettima as the only vice-presidential pick of the parties who can be president. He is a man of knowledge and accomplishment, of courage and integrity, of loyalty and energy. A trusted and trustworthy fellow, articulate, a breeder of men who has never succumbed to cant or bigotry. Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu has again shown he sees a good talent when he picks them and he picks a good talent when he sees them. Those who have followed Shettima as governor, senator and a warrior during the APC primary campaigns will only know that all those cries about Muslim-Muslim ticket is a red herring, away from the staunch beauty of a platform of doers, of the Tinubu-Shettima double barrel. More to come…
