The Ogun State governor, Dapo Abiodun Abiodun says his administration will take over reconstruction of Sango/Ota-Abeokuta Road in two weeks, if Federal Government fails to fix it within that period. Abiodun made this known shortly after inspecting some bad portions of the 52.5 kilometre road in Ewekoro axis, yesterday. According to him, the action had become necessary after the state government alongside Lagos state had made frantic efforts several times to draw the attention of the Federal Government, through the office of the Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola to the bad shape of the road without any positive response. The governor who expressed worry over the hardship motorists are being subjected to on the road declared that his administration will not fold its arms and allow its citizenry to continue to suffer due to the negligence of the authority in charge of this road.

While appealing to the people of the state, particularly those living along the road to be patient, the governor informed that the reason behind the inspection was to examine the level of infrastructural development in Ogun Central and Ogun West Senatorial Districts with a view to ascertain the level of damages done to some of the major roads in the areas so as to  fashion out the best way towards their reconstruction. He observed  that the road awarded to Julius Berger about 15 years ago had been abandoned making it impassable, saying that despite the various palliative being carried out on the road, some of the blue chip companies located along the road had failed to support the efforts of the government through its Corporate Social Responsiblity (CSR). He assured that the state government would continue to prioritise the welfare of the people of the state in line with his promises during the last governorship campaign.
