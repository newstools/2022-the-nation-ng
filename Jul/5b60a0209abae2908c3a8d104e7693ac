Spokesman of NCAA, Sam Adurogboye said the decision was the outcome of a financial and economic health audit carried out on the Airline by the Authority and the findings of an investigation conducted on the Airline’s flight operations recently, which revealed that Dana Airlines is no longer in a position to meet its financial obligations and to conduct safe flight operations. The NCAA, he said, acknowledges the negative effect this preemptive decision will have on the Airline’s passengers and the travelling public and seeks their understanding as the safety of flight operations takes priority over all other considerations.
