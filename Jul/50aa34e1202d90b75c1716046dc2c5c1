BBNaija “Level Up” housemate Chibueze Iyela aka Hermes has made known the ‘chemical reaction’ that’ll erupt in the House if he and Chichi ever get to ‘align’. The reality TV star, during a chat with two other housemates, while referring to himself as a ‘prostitute’, said he liked Chichi in a sensual way. According to Hermes, considering Chichi’s personality and his, if they ever get to that point where they are in total agreement with each other, they’ll saturate every corner of Biggie’s house with intense coitus.
