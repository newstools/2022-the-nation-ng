Super Eagles coach Jose Peseiro now has his Portuguese compatriot Rui Vitoria in charge of the Pharaohs of Egypt. The 52-year-old former coach of Benfica was appointed by the Egyptian Football Association (EFA) as the coach for its national team after Ehab Galal was sacked, according to a statement yesterday. “The Egyptian Football Association has reached a final deal with Portuguese Rui Vitoria to lead the Egyptian national team for the next four years,” the association wrote on Twitter.

Former coach Galal was dismissed on June 16 after the Pharaohs slipped to a shock 2-0 defeat by Ethiopia in the qualifiers for the upcoming African Cup of Nations. His stint lasted a mere two months after taking over from Carlos Queiroz who led Egypt to the AFCON final which they lost to Senegal in February. Egypt lost to Senegal again under Queiroz in the African play-off for a place at this year’s World Cup in Qatar.
