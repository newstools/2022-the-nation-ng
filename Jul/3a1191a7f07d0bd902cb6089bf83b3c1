A member of the House of Representatives Akin Alabi has declared the Labour Party (LP) will not get up to 15 votes in his polling unit. Alabi, who is the lawmaker representing Egbeda/Ona-Ara federal constituency, said this in a tweet while reacting to a trending media report that LP was planning fifteen agents per polling unit. He noted that LP and other parties will come after the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). His tweets generated mixed reactions. While some LP supporters argued that the party will mobilise voters for the 2023 elections, many others supported Alabi for stating the reality.
