The Nigeria Correctional Service (NCoS) has dismissed reports that Peter Nwachukwu, husband of the late gospel singer, Osinachi, and a suspected kidnap kingpin, Hamisu Bala (a.k.a. Wadume), escaped from custody during Friday’s jailbreak at Kuje Custodial Centre, Abuja. The Public Relations Officer, FCT Command, NCoS, Mr Chukwuedo Humphrey, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Tuesday in Abuja that the two inmates were still in custody. Some media reports had claimed that Osinachi’s husband and Wadume escaped during Friday’s terrorists’ attack on the custodial centre. NAN reports that terrorists, who attacked the custodial centre, freed about 879 inmates. Humphrey said that the clarification became necessary in view of a publication by an online medium alleging that Wadume and Osinachi’s husband escaped.
