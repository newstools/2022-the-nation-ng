The General Overseer of Omega Power Ministries (OPM) Church, Apostle Chibuzor Gift Chinyere, has listed conditions for any lady interested in marrying veteran actor, Kenneth Jideofor aka Aguba. This is coming after the cleric relocated Aguba from Enugu to Port Harcourt after photos of him looking shabby in a dirty environment with few worn out personal effects scattered around went viral on Monday. Chinyere offered the actor a free apartment at OPM free estate in Port Harcourt, capital of Rivers State. The veteran was also taken to the hospital for medical checkup. Seeing Aguba is fully settled in, the cleric announced his intention to sponsor his wedding with any lady who’s ready to agree with four conditions put out by him.

You must live with him for ten years after the wedding without separation or divorce. Which means, both of you must live together for 10 years. After 10 years, you are free to either remain in marriage or divorce. 2. You shall operate a joint account for the business OPM is opening for both of you. Meaning for any bank withdrawals, both of you must go to the bank together. 3. You must never deny him access to perform his conjugal rights after the wedding. 4. A team from the church would be visiting your home once in a month to ensure that everything is going on well and peacefully. Concluding his marriage terms, the cleric added: “For any lady that agrees to these conditions, send your phone number so we can commence the marriage process then, move forward.”
