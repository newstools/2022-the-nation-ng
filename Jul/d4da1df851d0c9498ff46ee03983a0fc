Nottingham Forest and Leeds are interested in signing Torino defender Ola Aina, according to Gazzetta dello Sport, via Toro News. The versatile wing-back spent last season operating as a left-sided wing-back and he made 21 appearances in Serie A. Now, he could be allowed to leave and a return to the Premier League is likely to be appealing for the 25-year-old. Aina spent a year at Fulham during 2020/21, making 31 appearances as the Cottagers were relegated from the Premier League. Aina has also played six times for Chelsea during his career and also spent a season with Hull. The man who has played 29 times for Nigeria is out of contract next summer and Torino would consider a sale.

Forest are reportedly on the hunt for versatile wing-back options. The Reds would dearly like to sign one or two players that can feature on either side and Aina matches that criteria. The London-born player is appealing in that sense and he’d perhaps be an affordable backup option for Forest to look at. Serie A clubs are also monitoring the situation. Sampdoria and Spezia provide interest from the Italian top flight. Steve Cooper loves his players to be able to adapt. Aina can play in both wing-back spots and can even operate in a more advanced role.
