the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor Enoch Adeboye, has said he never asked Christians to buy guns for self-protection. “I never asked Christians to go and buy guns. Samson in the Bible did not fight with guns,” the renowned cleric said yesterday at the monthly thanksgiving live television programme of the church. The clarification came amidst reports that the general overseer said it was now “fire-for-fire” for any attack on Christians.   10 takeaways from state visit to Portugal: Two nations and…     Fashola to Nigerians: be strategic with your votes     10 dead, seven injured in Yobe crash   “Don’t buy guns. You don’t want to kill anybody. We just must make sure that unwanted visitors don’t come to our churches. So, don’t go and buy guns,” he said. At the July edition of Holy Ghost Service, Pastor Adeboye had urged members of the church not to be afraid to attend church programmes because of terrorist attack on St. Francis Catholic Church in Owo, on June 5, where 40 worshippers were killed and over 80 others were injured. Adeboye urged Christians to rise to the occasion and call the bluff of the devil.
