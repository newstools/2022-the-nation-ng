Russia remains barred from Europe’s leading football competitions, including the Champions League, after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) rejected appeals by the national football federation and four clubs yesterday . CAS upheld decisions by UEFA and FIFA that excluded Russian national teams and clubs following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The decision leaves national champions Zenit St Petersburg out of the Champions League group stage. Another Russian team, Sochi, will be left out of the Champions League third qualifying-round draw, scheduled for Monday. If Russia had been allowed to take part, it wasn’t clear where their home games could be hosted or if Ukrainian clubs would boycott. CAS is also due to hear other cases involving Russian athletes and teams in numerous other sports. Many governing bodies have justified excluding Russia on similar safety grounds to those cited by UEFA.
