Director-General of National Unity Movement for Bola Ahmed Tinubu (NUMBAT) Bamidele Faparusi has called on Nigerians to embrace unity, national integration and cohesion despite their differences. The Director of Media and Publicity, Joseph Undu, in a statement yesterday, said the group is working with other patriotic citizens across religious and ethnic divides to promote unity ahead of the 2023 general elections. The group said it was supporting the APC presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, because of his detribalised and religious-tolerant nature.

The statement reads: “Placing competence and merit above religious and ethnic consideration in choosing leaders that would steer the affairs of the nation in the right direction is what Nigerians should consider while voting in 2023. “The APC presidential candidate is the only one among the presidential candidates who has a deep understanding of Nigeria, its diversity and challenges and the capacity to fix the country. Tinubu is a detribalised Nigerian, a great patriot, a great bridge builder and unifier, a religious tolerant man, and a believer in one God, one humanity. “Even with a Muslim-Muslim ticket, without having any fear of religious domination and suppression, we are conscious of the secularity status of Nigeria, and Tinubu is best positioned to protect our secular state.”
