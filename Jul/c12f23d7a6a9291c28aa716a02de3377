Chioma responded that she does not watch what other people are doing and she focuses on herself. Toyin then mentioned that Chioma likes to make a grand entrance, referencing Laura’s fashion show when Chioma deliberately hung back to touch up her makeup and make a grand entrance. The whole conversation went on with the ladies going off on each other. Toyin accused Chioma of being a mean girl, and Chioma accused Toyin of being jealous and competitive. The argument escalated and almost led to a physical fight, with Toyin charging at Chioma. She was held back by Iyabo and eventually walked out of the set for two hours.
