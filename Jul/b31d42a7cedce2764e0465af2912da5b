Nottingham Forest have signed goalkeeper Dean Henderson from Manchester United on a season-long loan, the newly-promoted Premier League club said on Saturday. United academy graduate Henderson made three appearances in all competitions last season and was unable to displace Spaniard David de Gea as first-choice goalkeeper at the Old Trafford club. “I’m absolutely delighted to be joining such a fantastic club with an amazing set of fans and a wonderful history,” Henderson said in a statement.

Forest, who beat Huddersfield Town in the Championship playoff final to seal their return to the Premier League, begin their campaign with a trip to Newcastle United on 6 August.
