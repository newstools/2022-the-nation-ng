According to forecasts from many analysts, by the end of 2022 the number of users of dating sites and applications around the world will exceed 413 million people. And the web dating industry itself will bring in more than $3.7 billion in profit per year. Huge numbers, right?

Is it possible to build a serious relationship using dating sites and apps? Let’s take a look at the statistics from Statista: At the same time, there are also negative trends. For example, during the coronavirus pandemic, the amount of malware and viruses spread through fraudulent dating sites increased. While earlier about 12% of people reported the infection of computers and smartphones with malware, in 2020 the figure more than doubled to 29%. Now it’s especially important to approach your choice of a dating site carefully, taking into account not only popularity and convenience, but also safety. OkCupid has been around since 2004 and has become a model for many newer dating sites. The platform is currently owned by the Match Group corporation, which also includes Tinder, Hinge, Plenty of Fish and many other services. Why the site is suitable for serious dating Key features OkCupid has a really large and active audience. But at the same time, the site has a key disadvantage — most of the important functions are paid for. On the one hand, this eliminates non-serious users. But on the other hand, it also pushes away an audience interested in getting acquainted. Bumble is perhaps the only dating app where girls always make the first step. Men can’t write first. This means the site offers a solution to excessive assertiveness and obsession from the male audience. This is a real problem on many dating services. Why the site is suitable for serious dating Key features Besides the standard functionality of the dating platform, Bumble offers additional features. For example, there is a Bumble Bizz section for finding business connections and jobs, as well as Bumble BFF for finding new friends in other cities and countries. A dating platform for those who seek to transfer communication from online to offline as soon as possible and dream of a strong romantic relationship. Why the site is suitable for serious dating Key features The Coffee meets Bagel application, using its own algorithm, every day selects the right pair for you based on your profile data. So we recommend that you be honest about yourself and your priorities. This dating app only works on Thursdays so you don’t waste all your free time on it. And it is on Thursdays that Thursday offers you new potential dates, so you can find the best matches. Why the site is suitable for serious dating Key features Thursday does not require a lot of your time and does not turn the search for a soulmate into an endless routine, like, for example, Tinder. You will spend a minimum of time on the app, but with maximum benefit for yourself and your personal life. One of the pioneers among dating sites, operating since 1995. In fact, this is the ancestor of all modern dating services that we know of. And even after almost three decades, Match remains popular. Why the site is suitable for serious dating Key features You can view other people’s profiles for free, and other users will be able to see your profile. But in the free version, you cannot reply to incoming messages. Also, Match quite often arranges offline events for its members. A good choice for those who are tired of endless swipes and trying to judge people only by photos. Here, the results of the personality test play a much larger role, which influence the selection of a potential match. Why the site is suitable for serious dating Key features Plenty of Fish is very easy to use and has a huge user base. At the same time, the audience here is not very loyal to the LGBT community, and the site has a frankly outdated design. Zoosk — quite a popular dating site, where advantages include a large audience, convenience, and good moderation. And among the shortcomings — an abundance of advertising and sometimes not the most intuitive interface. Why the site is suitable for serious dating Key features Zoosk allows you to evaluate many of the advantages of the site for free in order to decide whether you are ready to use a premium account and whether it is right for you. You don’t have to pay to use it right away. Omegle is the first chat roulette with strangers ever launched. The site has been operating since 2009 and still hasn’t lost relevance, despite some disadvantages. Why the site is suitable for serious dating Key features Omegle attracts people with its simplicity and accessibility. But at the same time, it pushes users away due to the lack of mobile applications, gender filter and poor moderation, which is critical for many. CooMeet is a chat roulette that is ideal for single men. The site connects them only with girls, and the girls themselves must verify their identity during registration. You can try and evaluate this chatroulette alternative here. Why the site is suitable for serious dating Key features Worth mentioning here are user-friendly apps for iOS and Android, CooMeet’s own affiliate program, a completely free trial for new members, and most importantly — a gender filter that never fails. Hinge is a dating app that uses a Nobel Prize-winning matchmaking algorithm (Gale-Shapley algorithm) to select matches. Why the site is suitable for serious dating Key features The developers call Hinge an application designed to be uninstalled. In other words this is where you will find your love, and after that you will no longer need Hinge. As you can see, the range of dating sites is truly impressive. You can easily choose a service for yourself, and personally evaluate all its advantages and disadvantages in order to use it to the fullest. Remember the main thing: success on any dating service, whether it’s a classic dating site or chat roulette, depends purely on you. From your openness and sincerity to your sociability and readiness to move from ordinary conversations and texting to more serious relationships. Who knows, perhaps the next random chat partner will be your future soulmate.
