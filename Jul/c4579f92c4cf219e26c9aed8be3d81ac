Napoli star Victor Osimhen has rejected talk that he is set for a move away from the club this summer. The 23-year-old – who is reportedly valued at £85million by Napoli – has been linked with moves to Arsenal, Manchester United, Newcastle and Bayern Munich after scoring 18 goals in 32 appearances across all competitions last term. But he said reports linking him away this summer ‘are just rumours’, insisting  he has received assurances from club president Aurelio De Laurentiis about their future plans. “’I’m in Napoli. And I have great respect for my club,” he told Corriere dello Sport as per Daily Mail. “They are just rumours of the market. I’m fine here and I’ve never had such close relationships with everyone as at this moment.

I am very happy to play with Napoli and we will see in the future.” Osimhen was also full of praise for former Inter Milan boss Luciano Spalletti, insisting the now Napoli boss is ‘ideal’ for him at this stage of his career. That is despite a video circulating on social media showing Spalletti telling Osimhen to leave the field for dissent during an intra-squad training match open to the public on Sunday at their pre-season training camp in the city of Castel di Sangro. “He is a top coach: every day he tries to motivate me and make me make the most of the potential I have,’ Osimhen added. “I think he is the ideal coach for me at this stage: he is one of the reasons why I always give my best. I am happy when he is satisfied with my performance.”
