Football legend Kenny Dalglish reckoned Rangers boss Gio van Bronckhorst will be heartbroken at losing Calvin Bassey. Nigerian international Bassey is poised to join Ajax after Gers chiefs accepted a bid believed to be worth £19million plus add-ons, as well as a 10% sell-on clause.  The 22-year-old was also wanted by English Premier League Brighton, but it’s believed the Dutch champions have won the race for his signature. However, after raking in £46m from Lisandro Martinez’s move to Manchester United, Ajax immediately identified versatile Bassey as the ideal replacement, and talks quickly progressed this week. Now, the youngster is on the verge of completing a record-breaking switch to the Netherlands after two years in Glasgow.

He told the Sunday Post: “It’s not for me to put a price on Bassey. But from what I have seen, there is no doubt he is a huge asset. “It will be heartbreaking for Giovanni if Calvin moves on. It would almost be like the Rangers manager is being punished for improving the player! “There is nothing he can do, though, as movement from club to club is part and parcel of football. It’s how Calvin got to Ibrox in the first place. “Overall, it’s a compliment to all concerned at Rangers when their players are being looked at by other clubs. But with the Champions League qualifiers on the horizon, Giovanni would prefer not to lose his best players.”
