Super Eagles captain Ahmed Musa has confessed the personal burden he carried after Ghana edged Nigeria to the 2022 FIFA World Cup in March. The Nigerians faced their eternal rivals in the final qualifying round for the Mundial over two legs. But after forcing a decent 0-0 draw in Kumasi, the Eagles could only manage a 1-1 draw in Abuja, allowing Ghana to make it to the World Cup on the away goal rule. Having represented Nigeria at the 2014 and 2018 editions, Qatar 2022 would have been Musa’s third appearance at football’s biggest fiesta. “It was a very big disappointment for me because the World Cup is one of the best tournaments that as a player you want to go there,” the former Leicester City winger told Arise TV.

That game against Ghana, I keep on imagining it till now. But in football, you have to get a sad day like that.” Musa is Nigeria’s highest goal scorer at the World Cup, but he will not have the chance to add to his four goals in Qatar. It is no surprise that the former CSKA Moscow star felt a lot of pain after the second leg against Ghana. “At the end of that game, I spent more than three days without eating. Even my wife was worried,” Musa said.“The young players still have a lot of time. But I thought that would be my last World Cup. I can’t say anything more because that’s what God decided is going to happen.”
