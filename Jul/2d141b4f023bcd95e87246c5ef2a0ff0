Just as well!   Sources said the victims were shot for overtaking the escorts’ vehicle and denting it in the process. Police spokesman Bright Edafe said two persons died in the incident, adding that it was uncertain if the perpetrators were policemen. “We are still not sure if they were police escorts for now. But it is not good news because two innocent people were killed. “We are investigating to know which particular convoy or VIP was on movement when that incident happened,” he said.
