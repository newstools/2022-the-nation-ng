Actress Chioma Ifemeludike, has scorned her colleagues for refuting claims of having s3xual relations with founder of Omega Fire Ministry, Apostle Johnson Suleman. Few days ago, a popular blog published list of some actresses and BBNaija celebrities who allegedly had illicit affairs with Suleman. The blog also accused the Apostle being diabolical. Reacting to the blogger’s allegation, a number of actresses debunked the viral reports but never denied knowing the controversial man of God. Suleiman, responding in a viral YouTube post on Wednesday, dared the ‘faceless’ blogger to bare his/her identity.

During her confessional video, the actress alleged she slept with Suleman twice and was paid handsomely for her services but denied knowing that he was a cleric at that time. She also revealed her colleague, Lynda-Clems Bishop, hooked her up with the Apostle, an allegation Lynda has since denied. Addressing her colleagues, Ifemeludike told them to continue denying their acts but noted it was only a matter of time before the truth would be uncovered. “Debunking saga. Truth cannot be covered. Please debunk your shit in peace, but allow us to decide who is a good man and who is an unrepentant pastor_titude. God cannot be mocked,” she wrote.
