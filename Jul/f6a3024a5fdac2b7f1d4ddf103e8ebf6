Steven Energy Institute has expressed the readiness to create a pool of well-trained people that would join in the solar revolution. Its Registrar,  Ebami Arogboritse, said the institute had undertaken a curriculum development, sponsored consultants to various countries to understudy them, studied the sector and the manpower needs before the curriculum was developed for the country. According to him, the institute interfaced with the National Board for Technical Education, to ensure the requirements were provided, facilities and equipment put in place, adding that no other training centre for renewable energy like his.

President, Renewable Energy Association of Nigeria (REAN), Dr. Segun Adaju, noted that to install one megawatt of solar plant, at no fewer than 20 installers would be required. He, therefore, stressed the  need to provide the requisite capacity and manpower expertise so that Nigeria could scale up and provide better services to the industry. He noted that the demand was increasing because more power plants were coming yearly hence the need to close the gap very fast. “You see them bringing their people, they are the ones doing the jobs, and we are saying no, Nigerians can do the job. So, this calls for the need to build the capacity for more people to have the certification/qualification to do solar in Nigeria,” Adaju added.
