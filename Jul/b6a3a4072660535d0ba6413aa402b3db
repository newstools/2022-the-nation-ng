MC and comedian Gbenga Adeyinka 1st has bashed individuals and companies that patronise entertainers who are known to indulge in substance use. According to the thespian, the use of drug/marijuana among youth is prevalence because many Nigerians are encouraging drug-addicted celebrities. “Many brands are patronizing celebrities who taking drugs and abandoned many of us who are drug-free personalities, then they are the ones encouraging drug abuse,” Adeyinka begins.

I speak for myself, Alibaba, Kofi and a host of others. A lot think that the problem is bad leadership. I totally disagreed because our biggest problem in Nigeria is the problem of drugs.” Adeyinka said youth lack the cognitive capacities to distinguish the reality portrayed on audio-visual content from real-life experiences. “There is different between celebrity and ‘yeyebrity’. Many ‘yeyebrity’ are famous today because Nigerians given them attention. Recently, I was watching a video where a so-called celebrity, in the name campaign for somebody went pant down on top of a vehicle. I felt it was height of disrespect. Also, DJs should stop playing songs of any singer who are known and confirm to be drug user.” The Laffmattazz boss lauded the effort of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) in curbing the menace of drug abuse and charged them to do more.
