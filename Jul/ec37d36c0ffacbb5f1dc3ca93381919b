Popular cross dresser, Idris Okuneye aka Bobrisky, has complained about the way he looks when he takes pictures with an Android phone. According to the Instagram celebrity, he comes out looking like an old retired ‘prostitute’ whenever he’s captured with an Android phone. Bobrisky warned people with that brand of phone to steer clear from taking him because he’s fed up with the old retired ‘ashewo’ it gives him. But the controversial media personality noted persons with iPhone 13 are free to take his pictures at will.
