Rivers governorship candidate of the Labour Party, Beatrice Itubo, has claimed that some defectors from the ruling and opposition parties in the State are mounting pressure on her to step down. Itubo, who is also the Chairman of the Nigerian Labour Congress(NLC) in the State, described the pressure as antics of old politicians, who were trying to recycle themselves by leveraging on Peter Obi’s popularity. She spoke at the weekend in an event tagged: “Obi Structure – a people-oriented strategy sensitization” organised by Peter Obi Volunteer Network(PVN). She said: ” If we are not careful, this country is already heading for the rock. And if we refuse to accept this golden opportunity that God has given to us to rescue us and we continue in this madness, finally when we hit the rock, it will explode anybody can be the victim.

He said: “The objective is simple, Nigerians are tired and we want to take back our country.”.
