The United States Women’s national team (USWNT) has confirmed it will face the Nigerian women’s national team in two friendly matches slated for September. The US ladies will first trade tackles with the Super Falcons on September 3 at the Children’s Mercy Park in Kansas City, Kansas. Three days later (Sept. 6), both teams will face off again at the Audi Field in Washington, D.C. Head coach of the USWNT, Vlatko Andonovski, confirmed the games, saying: “First, I’m just excited to play two matches against Nigeria. They have some very talented players who will present a lot of different problems for us to solve on both sides of the ball.

The USWNT is the most successful team in international women’s football, winning four Women’s World Cup titles and four Olympic gold medals. The Stars and Stripes are the current world champions. Nigeria are no minnows in the women’s game, either. The Super Falcons are the most successful team on the African continent, with a record nine Cup of Nations titles  and are presently in the hunt for a tenth championship honour at Morocco 2022.
