Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila has apologised for posting his photos undergoing a course at Harvard University in the United States of America. The Speaker had Tuesday posted some photos of himself on his verified Twitter handle @femigbaja with a caption: “Back to class. In a leadership course at @Harvard @Kennedy_School . Forget the number of grey hairs one is never too old to learn, broaden or sharpen your skills” The tweet generated criticisms from many Nigerians who felt it was insensitive at a time when universities in the country were shut. The Speaker, in another post on his Twitter handle on Wednesday, apologised. He tweeted: “Yesterday I posted a picture of myself at the @Harvard @Kennedy_School, undergoing a course. That post was not sensitive to the present feelings of fellow citizens, especially parents and students who are presently bearing the brunt of the ongoing closure of public universities …owing to the unresolved issues between the Academic Staff Union of Universities and the Federal Government of Nigeria. “I apologize for the post at this time, and I hope you will understand that it was not my intention to cause disaffection. As Speaker of @HouseNGR,I have made multiple interventions within the powers of the legislature to avert the ongoing strike.I had direct engagements with ASUU..relevant government agencies.

We all await the outcome of the 2-week ultimatum given for the conclusion of negotiations with ASUU. “I have long been a champion of public education in Nigeria, and I have consistently advocated programs, policies and investments to improve the quality of public education in the country. “In my constituency and beyond, I have attracted a new international students hostel inUNILAG, facilitated access to free internet WiFi in ALL public tertiary institutions in Lagos State; provision of modern ICT centres in 24 secondary schools across the state, provision of scholarships and grants to indigent students in selected tertiary institutions,..provision of laptops to ALL secondary school teachers in my constituency and hundreds of students, facilitated the renovation of over 15 public schools in Lagos, facilitated the ongoing construction of the Open University Campus and JAMB CBT Centre in my constituency, facilitated the ongoing construction of School Auditoriums in both LASU and School of Legal Studies, Katsina; facilitated the construction of a public library in Ondo; facilitated the ongoing construction of an emergency care centre for the University of Lagos Teaching Hospital amongst other numerous interventions.
