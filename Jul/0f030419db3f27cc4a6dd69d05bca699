Women’s 100m hurdles world record holder Tobi Amusan could not contain her relief for finally winning a medal for Nigeria at the global stage. The 25-year-old broke the 100m hurdles record at the World Championships on Sunday when she ran a time of 12.12 seconds in her semifinal in Eugene, Oregon, Jamaican Britany Anderson took silver, followed by Olympic gold medalist Jasmine Camacho-Quinn of Puerto Rico. Amusan took eight hundredths off American Keni Harrison‘s world record of 12.20 from 2016. It’s the largest time drop for a world record in the event in 42 years. She then bettered that in the final when she crossed the line in 12.06 seconds to claim gold, but the record was ruled ineligible as the wind speed exceeded the legal limit but it does not bother the 2018 Commonwealth Games gold medalist.

Now I finally did it.” “The goal was to come out and to win this gold,” Amusan added. “I just did it. Honestly, I believe in my abilities but I was not expecting a world record at these championships. You know, the goal is always just to execute well and get the win. So the world record is a bonus. Amusan said of her world record in the semifinals: “I knew I had it in me but I could not believe it when I saw it on the screen after the semis. But it was just a matter of time.”
