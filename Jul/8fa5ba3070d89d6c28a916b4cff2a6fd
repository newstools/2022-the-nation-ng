Founder of First City Monument Bank (FCMB) Otunba Olasubomi Balogun has said his long relationship and involvement in the annual Ojude Oba festival is because of in-born patriotism and love for the Ijebu as a people. He said it was only natural for FCMB to sponsor and promote the festival. According to him, the bank has been a major sponsor of the festival for almost two decades. Balogun spoke at the 2022 edition of the event in Ijebu-Ode. Themed ‘The return of Ojude Oba’, the festival is returning after two years of inaction due to COVID-19. The festival is an occasion for the Ijebu people to pay homage to their royal father and show appreciation for his benevolence.

Also, FCMB must be interested in anything I am interest in. There is an in-born patriotism there. Wherever you may hear of me, I don’t want anybody to forget that I am originally from Ijebu; that’s where FCMB comes from. The only way we can show appreciation to the founders and progenitors is to participate in all the traditional undertakings that bring to the fore the traditions and origins of the Ijebu. It is a unique event and I am very much involved. “If I created an institution, it is only natural that it benefits my people. As a patriotic Ijebu, as soon as we started building branches, I brought FCMB here and the people have been patronising the bank.” The founder noted that he is proud of the heritage of the Ijebu, which means much to him. He however lamented the absence of his age group at the festival arena. “Unfortunately only a few of my age group are in attendance. Maybe this is due to old age syndrome,” he said. Balogun however promised that the 2023 edition will be colourful and eventful.
