These guidelines have generated immense public interest which has necessitated escalating it to Mr. Governor, who has advised further sensitisation of the public and key stakeholders to ensure a clearer understanding of the objectives of the guidelines. “To this end, we are suspending the implementation of these guidelines in the meantime for the Executive Council to deliberate on it and ensure adequate public sensitisation and stakeholder engagement to reach a consensus required for a successful guideline development. “The Lagos State Ministry of Health remains committed to planning, devising and implementing policies that promote qualitative, affordable, and equitable healthcare services to the citizenry.”
