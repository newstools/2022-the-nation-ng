Qatar’s World Cup stadiums are set to be alcohol-free, with beer sales outside arenas only allowed before and after some matches, a source with knowledge of plans for the soccer tournament said. This year’s World Cup is the first to be held in a Muslim country with strict controls on alcohol, presenting unique challenges for organisers of an event often associated with beer-drinking fans and sponsored by global brewing brands. “At stadiums, the plans are still being finalised, but the current discussion is to allow fans to have beer upon arrival and when leaving the stadium, but beer won’t be served during the match or inside the stadium bowl,” the source told Reuters. Soccer’s relationship with booze has long been a tricky one and in the lead-up to the 2014 World Cup, Brazil lifted a ban on alcohol at stadiums, after pressure from governing body FIFA.

Fans at November’s World Cup will also be able to buy beer during restricted times in certain parts of the main FIFA fan zone in the Al Bidda Park in Doha, the Qatari capital. “Unlike previous World Cup fan zones, the beer won’t be served all day long, but at restricted times,” the source added. Visitors are prohibited from carrying alcohol into Qatar, even from the airport duty-free, and they cannot shop at the country’s only liquor store, on the outskirts of Doha, where foreign residents with permits can buy for home consumption. The price of beer inside the fan zones and close to the stadium has not yet been agreed upon, the source said.
