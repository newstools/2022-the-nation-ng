The Nigeria Football Federation has congratulated Super Falcons’ forward Rasheedat Ajibade for emerging as joint top-scorer of the just-ended 12th  Women Africa Cup of Nations finals in Morocco, where the Super Falcons earned a ticket to the FIFA World Cup finals even as the team failed to realize its ambition of a 10th  triumph. NFF General Secretary, Dr Mohammed Sanusi said: “We rejoice with Rasheedat Ajibade for her emergence as joint top-scorer of the tournament and we implore her to continue to show even more prolificacy and commitment in the jerseys of club and country. Her three goals surely helped the Super Falcons to win a World Cup ticket. Our team would certainly have been in the Final if not for the incident that led to her expulsion in the semi final match against the host nation. “She probably would have won the award outright if she finished the game and played one more match.”   Oregon 2022: Tobi Amusan wins gold, sets new record twice     Oregon 2022: World Record a bonus, says Amusan     Oregon 2022: World Record is a bonus, says Amusan   Ajibade was ejected after 70 minutes of the semi final against Morocco at the Complexe Prince Moulay Abdellah, with Nigeria already one woman down, and the Falcons played the next 50 minutes (of regulation and extra time) with only nine players, losing in the ensuing penalty shoot-out. Meanwhile, Sanusi has also congratulated Mimisen Calvin-Onwuka, who played the role of Assistant Referee 1 in the Final match between Morocco and South Africa on Saturday, saying her stellar performance alongside referee Salima Mukansanga from Rwanda did not go unnoticed by the global football community. He urged her to continue to develop herself with available top-level courses and programmes in order to continue her rise to global reckoning.\
