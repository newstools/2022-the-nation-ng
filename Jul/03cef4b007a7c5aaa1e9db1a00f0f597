The Lagos State House of Assembly has denied reports that it had secretly passed the Sharia Bill into law to get northern support for the All Progressives Congress (APC) Presidential Candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu. Chairman of the House Committee on Information, Security and Strategy, Setonji David (Badagry II), debunked the rumours in a statement yesterday. There were online reports that the assembly hurriedly passed a bill to set up Sharia Courts, paving way for Sharia Law which had been signed into law by the governor. But David said the report was a mere ‘figment of the imagination of the writer and a total lie from the pit of hell’. He described the report as ‘far from the reality’.

The report is a mere figment of the writer’s imagination and a total lie from the pit of hell. “No informed person should believe this lie against the assembly that is above the common standard of excellence. The news is far from reality. Some people are just mischievous, spreading all sorts of untrue stuff. Is it possible to pass a law under cover? The process of law making is universal and very open. You cannot pass a law without subjecting it to public hearing in Lagos State.” The lawmaker urged residents and Nigerians to take the peddlers as ‘uninformed and uneducated persons who should be schooled about the law making process’. According to him, Tinubu was a fast selling product across the country and does not need any law from the state to further endear him to all Nigerians.
