The new Blue and White midfielder will thus continue his career in LaLiga SmartBank, in which he has competed in the last two seasons with AD Alcorcón and SD Huesca. Kelechi began his career at the Diamond Football Academy in his country. His qualities caught the attention of Arsenal FC, who signed him for their under-23 team in 2016. Later, he played on loan at MVV Maastricht in the second division of the Netherlands and at VVV Venlo, with whom he competed in the Dutch top flight. In the 2018-19 campaign he experienced a new assignment, in this case to FC Porto, who enrolled him in his subsidiary team. For the following course, he separated from Arsenal FC and began his stage in Spanish football. SD Huesca incorporated him for a project that would end with a promotion to LaLiga Santander. After making his debut in the top flight in the 20/21 season, in the winter market of that year, he joined AD Alcorcón on loan, where he became a regular starter and participated in 18 games. Last season, back at SD Huesca, he took part in 19 league games and 2 Copa del Rey games. In addition, he is a full international with Nigeria.”
