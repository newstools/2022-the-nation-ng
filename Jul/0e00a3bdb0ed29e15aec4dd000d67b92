Super Eagles midfielder Joe Aribo has reportedly rejected a new contract offer from Rangers. The midfielder has just one year left on his current contract at Ibrox, but he may be calling time on his stint in Govan this summer with interest from south of the border. The Nigeria international could opt to take on a new challenge next season, with reports claiming he could quit Ibrox as early as next week. English Premier League clubs including Southampton, Crystal Palace Nottingham Forest and Fulham have all shown interest in the 25-year-old.

However, Football Scotland suggest Aribo could be on the way out of the club by the end of next week. His exit could see the Light Blues bank a healthy profit after securing the Nigerian from Charlton Athletic for a fee of £300,000 back in 2019. Rangers have been keen to keep Aribo at the club after he established himself as a key member of Giovanni van Bronckhorst’s side after the Dutch coach took over from Steven Gerrard.
