The Idiroko Unit Command of Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in Ogun, has appealed to motorists to avoid indiscriminate parking of vehicles, especially around ram markets, during the Eld-el-Kabir celebration. The Idiroko Unit Commander of FRSC,Mr Akinwunmi Olaluwoye, made the appeal in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Friday in Ota,Ogun. Olaluwoye noted that parking indiscriminately on the roads had increased traffic gridlocks around Idiroko and its environs. The unit commander said that such unethical behaviour of motorists could only frustrate the efforts of the FRSC personnel towards controlling traffic jams during the Sallah festival. “We have massively deployed both Regular and Special Marshals to accident-prone areas and to check the excesses of motorists so as to have a hitch-free festival.
