He charged them to educate the electorates on why Tinubu is the candidate that could break the circle of poverty, embezzlement and insecurity. His words:  “I appeal to the Christian Association of Nigeria ( CAN) and other interest groups aggrieved by the Muslim -Muslim ticket to sheath their swords, as the decision was not to undermine any one or group, but a winning strategy. “We are to swing into action and map out strategy to ensure Tinubu wins Ondo State with landslide victory.”
