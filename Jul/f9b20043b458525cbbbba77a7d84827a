Self-styled ‘wahala’singer, Portable has taken a swipe at Afrobeat super star, Davido for unfollowing him on social media. While Davido is well-known as a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) supporter with his uncle Ademola Adeleke as Osun governorship candidate of the party, Portable has been rooting for Governor Adegboyega Oyetola of the All Progressives Congress(APC). The “Zazu” crooner, in several videos, was seen rooting for Oyetola and APC presidential candidate Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. Portable has established rapport with top entertainers, including the DMW boss. There were speculations Davido had unfollowed him over the former’s decision to back APC in Osun.

He explained unlike his senior counterpart, Davido who is from a wealthy home, he wasn’t fortunate to come from one which is why he’s propelled to hustle real hard to make money and not go back to the trenches. He said: “Open your ears and listen. My father isn’t a rich ma..I am not the son of a rich man, I’m from the trenches. “I am the one that brought riches to my family. Open your ears so my words can enter. “I am running and hustling in this manner and it’s simply because of money. And also to avert suffering. So that that that which my family had to endure doesn’t also become my portion. “Once again, my father wasn’t a rich man. I come from the trenches but managed to bring my family into wealth. So support who support you. They wasted no time in unfollowing us,” Portable said.
