Apart from the effects of lingering fuel scarcity, Nigerians are confronted with the soaring cost of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) or cooking gas – a double assault on their psyche and pocket. MUYIWA LUCAS reports. The economics theory of scarcity at the source of production may aptly describe the gas situation in the country. This is because notwithstanding the huge gas reserves in the country, Nigerians are faced with an existential challenge as they are not just battling escalating prices of foodstuff, but also are spending more to cook. The cost of cooking gas, also known as Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), has drastically increased. The Nigeria LNG, which has been very active in the production and supply of the commodity, cannot produce all that is needed domestically. Group Managing Director of the Nigeria National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, Mele Kyari, while appearing before the House of Representative Committee on Petroleum (Downstream), headed by Abdullahi Gaya, over the rising cost of diesel and gas earlier in the week, noted that the only way to tackle the rising price is to increase the production of crude oil. He blamed the problem on the non-functioning refineries. Kyari said besides that the Russia-Ukraine war was affecting supply of products across the world, most major oil companies were also shutting down due to the energy transmission to eliminate fossil fuel. The National President, Nigerian Association of Liquefied Petroleum Gas Marketers (NALPGAM), Oladapo Olatunbosun, said a reason for the rising cost of cooking gas was as a result of sharp practices in the industry. He said unlike diesel which is imported, cooking gas was produced in the country, but profiteering was a problem. “There is a lot of profiteering going on in the LPG business. The kind of market we are seeing, which the terminal owners are seeing, I must be sincere, there is a lot of cross-border trading. There are infrastructural challenges, but there are still human interventions that we need to control. How many gas plant owners are actually off-takers? There is production going on in Edo. How many of them are they selling? People come from different angles who are portfolio investors, they buy gas and they hack on it, the price goes up,” he said. The larger chunk of the LPG needed  is imported and because of this, it has fallen victim to the ongoing Russia/Ukraine war.

The Naira has been highly devalued. Major importers of the commodity are also struggling to get foreign exchange to purchase the commodity.
