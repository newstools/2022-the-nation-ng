Lagos State Commissioner of Police Abiodun Alabi has urged students to support efforts to improve policing and citizen safety. He spoke during a stakeholder event organised by the Police Community Relations Committee (PCRC), to enlighten pupils and others on the importance of police officers in the community. Alabi, who was represented by ACP Mary Ayim, said citizen safety has become everyone’s responsibility and the support of students was critical as the force rallies stakeholders in a national campaign to ensure optimal security. He listed the challenges bedeviling the police to include poor funding, lack of logistics, training and others which, he noted, were affecting the police’ performance.

He also urged parents to raise their children in the right way and pay attention to their relations with others. Chairman of the PCRC Apostle Kehinde Sowemimo said the association was determined to intensify partnership that will help boost national security. Sowemimo described the event as not just about the police and the people, but police and the greater tomorrow, and to teach the youths that we need the police in our community. According to him, PCRC has 112 divisions and 114 area commands. Every command, he added, is engaged in one form of sensitisation programme or stakeholder meeting to reduce crime and build public confidence in the police. The Divisional Chairman of PCRC, who was also the chief host, Kolapo Kolawole, said the programme was to bridge the gap between the police and the public. He implored children to be good ambassadors of themselves and Lagos State, and support the campaign to rid the state of crime and vices.
