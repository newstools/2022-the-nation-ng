A Federal High Court in Abuja has approved the request of former Imo State Governor Rochas Okorocha to travel to the United States (U.S.A) for medical attention. In a ruling yesterday, Justice Inyang Ekwo ordered the court’s Registrar to release Okorocha’s international passport, which he deposited with the court as part of the conditions attached the N500 million bail earlier granted him. Justice Ekwo ordered Okorocha to return the passport to the Registrar not later than three days after his return to the country. The judge threatened to declare Okorocha, who currently represents Imo West at the Senate, wanted, should he attempts to abuse the opportunity granted him.

In the motion he filed for leave to travel, Okorocha said before his arraignment on May 31, he had undergone medical surgery at the Ambulatory Surgery Center in Texas, U.S.A, for “distal femur fracture” he sustained in an accident. The ex-governor added that he had been on regular/scheduled care and treatment at the same Ambulatory Surgery Centre, where he had been scheduled for further medical tests, observation and treatment on July 19, 2022 or immediately thereafter.
