Wilfried Zaha and Eberechi Eze sensationally scored to ensure Crystal Palace picked up a 3-0 win over Queens Park Rangers in a pre-season match at Loftus Road on Saturday. Eze opened the scoring for the Eagles before Zaha struck twice to help the Premier League club end their penultimate pre-season match on a high. Eze found the back of the net against his former club with a 20-yard strike and gave Palace the lead in the 29th minute. The English-Nigerian star collected the ball back from his own free-kick and fired home with a sensational strike.

In the last chance for Palace in the first half, Zaha could only hit the defence with a shot after an impressive run along the left wing. After the break, Palace made three changes, with Will Hughes, James McArthur, and David Boateng coming on, while Nathan Ferguson, James Tomkins, and Luke Plange were withdrawn.
