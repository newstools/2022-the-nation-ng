President of the Nigeria Football Federation and FIFA Council Member Amaju Pinnick has counselled the Super Falcons to think of Nigeria and their scores of millions of fans back home when they enter the pitch against the hosts Morocco in the second semi final match of the 12th Women Africa Cup of Nations competition in Rabat on Monday night. “The match against Morocco will be perhaps the toughest hurdle for the Super Falcons here. However, I have told them to think of our country and the teeming support back home, and the Government that has shown them much love and encouragement. “They must be dogged and exhibit as always, that unique Nigeria spirit that makes us to overcome challenges, hurdles and obstacles. I am confident that we will be in the Final on Saturday.”   Mourinho shows off new tattoo for European clean sweep     WAFCON 2022: Falcons battle Morocco as StarTimes launches…     State Gov’t back Bayelsa United to qualify for NPFL   Monday night’s spectacle at the Complexe Prince Moulay Abdellah will see the Falcons aim for their 10th Final Match of the Women AFCON, since the competition was launched as a biennial event in Nigeria 24 years ago.
