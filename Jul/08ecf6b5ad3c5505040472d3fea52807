Sadio Mane says he first told Liverpool of his desire to leave the Premier League club last year, explaining that wanted to test himself elsewhere. Just crowned Africa’s men’s Player of the Year for a second time, the 30-year-old signed a three-year deal with 32-time German champions Bayern Munich in June. “It was last year I took my decision to leave because I need a new challenge in my life,” Mane told BBC Sport Africa. “For me, it was the right time.

On Thursday, he was acclaimed as Africa’s best player for a second time, seeing off compatriot and Chelsea goalkeeper Edouard Mendy as well as former team-mate Mohamed Salah of Egypt. After joining in 2016, he won the Champions League, Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup, Uefa Super Cup, and the Club World Cup. “I spent eight years in the Premier League, and of course, I spent six wonderful years with Liverpool and I can say we won almost everything possible,” Mane added.
