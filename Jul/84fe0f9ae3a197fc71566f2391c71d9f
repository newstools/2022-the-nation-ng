The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Lagos State has denied picking Nollywood actress, Funke Akindele, as running mate to its governorship flag bearer, Olajide Adediran. Publicity Secretary Hakeem Amode said the party was not aware of any running mate yet. Amode was reacting to reported emergence of Akindele as running mate nominee to Adediran. According to him, Adediran will soon announce his running mate and everybody will know. He said: “It is not in my place to announce who the running mate to our governorship candidate, Jandor, is. Let us wait for the candidate   Coalition promises to ensure victory for Oyetola     I’ll not let you down, Adeleke tells Timi of Ede     Four injured as PDP, APC supporters clash in Ede   himself to announce. “Has the candidate of the party announced anywhere that he has picked his own running mate? What you are reading online on this, is it from the party’s candidate? “The candidate will announce who his running mate is and he has not done that. We should wait for the official announcement.” There have been speculations that Akindele has become Adediran’s running mate. Also, a chieftain of the party said he was not sure of the choice of Akindele. He said he has been reading the news on social media but he was certain that would not be the right channel to announce a running mate. Efforts to speak with Adediran were unsuccessful as repeated calls to his mobile line were not answered.
