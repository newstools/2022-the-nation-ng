He said: “We hope that  all intending pilgrims would be airlifted. We have two planes. “The first one will airlift 500 pilgrims and the remaining 326 would be attached with some pilgrims from Bauchi and be airlifted. There is no cause for alarm. All the 826 pilgrims would surely be airlifted to the holy land.” An intending pilgrim from the state, who pleaded anonymity expressed disgust with the delay, saying “we have finished all necessary preparations and waiting to be airlifted to Saudi Arabia.”
