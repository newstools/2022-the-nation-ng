DStv and GOtv customers can look forward to the 2022 TotalEnergies CAF Women’s Africa Cup of Nations (WAFCON), which will be held in Morocco from 2 to 23 July. This will be the 12th edition of the WAFCON and the first to feature 12 teams (split into three groups: Group A – Morocco, Burkina Faso, Senegal, Uganda; Group B – Cameroon, Zambia, Tunisia, Togo; and Group C – Nigeria, South Africa, Burundi, Botswana). The last WAFCON was played in 2018 in Ghana and saw Nigeria claim a record-extending ninth title after defeating South Africa on penalties in the final. The scheduled 2020 WAFCON was cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

The main threat to Nigeria’s ambitions will come from South Africa and Cameroon – both appearing at their 11th WAFCON t – while the likes of hosts Morocco, Zambia and Senegal will be dark horses. The WAFCON serves as a qualification tournament for next year’s FIFA Women’s World Cup as the four semi-finalists secure automatic qualification to the global tournament. The four losing quarterfinalists will play two separate playoffs in a ‘Repechage’ round, with the two winners of those matches advancing to the inter-confederation playoffs – a mini-tournament staged in Australia and New Zealand early next year which will determine the final qualifiers for the 2023 World Cup.
