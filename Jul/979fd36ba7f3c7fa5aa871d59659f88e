A former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Babachir Lawal and the former Speaker, House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara on Saturday met with Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike, behind closed doors. They held undisclosed talks with Wike at the governor’s country home in Rumueprikom, Obio-Akpor Local Government Area, Rivers State. Dogara, who emerged from the meeting said they were on a quest to build an all-inclusive Nigeria. He said: “Everyone agrees with us that Governor Wike is one of those indispensable political leaders. For us, it is a search to build an all inclusive Nigeria.   2023: Why all Yoruba should vote Tinubu     Burna Boy, Future headline Canadian concert     ‘Coup can’t solve Nigeria’s problem’   “So, we feel that as part of the agenda setting, we should meet with him and that is the reason why we are here. And for the rest, whatever it is, maybe in the future we can discuss that.” Lawal also explained that their mission was a brotherly visit to the governor of Rivers. “We came to visit our brother. He (Wike)  is our brother. So, every now and then, the Bible enjoins you to visit one another. That is what we just did,” he said. Lawal said the interaction with the Rivers governor had nothing to do with the meeting some northern leaders held in Abuja on Friday. “No, there are many things in the world for which you need to visit a brother, so there is nothing to do with our meeting in Abuja,” he said.
