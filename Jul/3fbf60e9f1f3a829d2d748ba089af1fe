Ex-militant leader Asari Dokubo has described the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP) as a scam defrauding Nigerians with lies. The founder of Niger Delta People’s Volunteer Force stated this on Facebook via his Dokubo Asari Justice Foundation page. He also said the OBI-dient movement of the former Anambra Governor cannot succeed “because it is going nowhere”. Dokubo claimed that Obi cannot square up to the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and his Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Atiku Abubakar in 2023. He also queried Obi’s achievements as Governor, saying the money he saved was child’s play to what Rivers Governor Nyesom Wike spends.

Peter Obi is a scamming people with lies and people are believing him. “This is nauseating. Peter Obi was a governor of Anambra state for eight years. “Anambra State is one of the advantageous states in Nigeria because of the people. They have Onitsha, Awka, Nnewi. These are the biggest goldmines in Nigeria after Lagos, Port Harcourt and Aba. “They said he saved seventy-something billion. What is seventy-something billion? The money that Wike toys with in Rivers. “How would you compare Obi with Tinubu or Atiku? What is his antecedent? Lies. You are showing documents. Who showed that you rejected the lands? All these small small [sic] scams, who dem wan do naw [sic]?”
