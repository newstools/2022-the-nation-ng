Cross River State Governor Ben Ayade has said the state opted for the concessioning of industries his administration built, to ensure they remained state’s assets. He spoke at the Governor’s Office, Calabar during the concession signing ceremony between Cross River and HBMSL Group. According to the terms of the agreement, HBMSL is to assume management of the industries and ensure that products from the industries are rolled out within three months. The governor said: “Sometime ago, we did a referendum on whether the government should run this industry as government or privatise, and the generality of the opinion was that government assets should remain government assets, as privatisation has not brought about any benefit. “Rather, all we need is to create jobs, which is why we have gone with the option of concessions because we want the assets to remain the property of Cross River State Government.”   Fresh trouble for Tambuwal, Bala, others as court axes Umahi     2023: Buhari hails APC leaders over choice of candidates     Abubakar Aliyu and the never-ending power grid collapse   He hoped that as a tested and proven consortium, HBMSL would live up to its billing. “With HBMSL Group, we have got the right people that God has put on our path. They have been tested and proven, have chains of businesses and have their foundation on God. So, it is certain that such a group will have a good conscience. “I am happy to announce to you that the people of Cross River have heard your request for cooperation and we will surely cooperate. “We will roll out our drums in three months when these factories start manufacturing products,” said Ayade. The Chairman of HBMSL, Pastor Yemisi Kudehinbu, hailed the governor’s efforts in industrialisation and pledged her group’s commitment to the concession agreement.
