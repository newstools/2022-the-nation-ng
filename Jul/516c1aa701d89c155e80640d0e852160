The meeting held  in Birmingham, focused  on how sports can be used to contribute to national development objectives and the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda – a global agenda and blueprint that aims to end poverty, protect the planet and make sure all people enjoy peace and prosperity. The Minister since the beginning of his tenure, has prioritised the utilisation of sports for peace building, as well as the reclassification of sports as business, which has the potentials to contribute immensely to the nation’s economy and drive development.

Each meeting focuses on priority sport policy issues and progress made on collaboration and joint work.
