Head of Installations at Mojec Monday Ubogu said  efficient metering would assuage deficiencies associated with poor metering process and build trust in customers. He said: “With the national end user metering gap just over 10 million today, the imperatives of a robust and efficient metering infrastructure in the NESI cannot be over-emphasised. Efficient metering will increase customers’ confidence in billing transparency, completely eradicate the quagmire of estimated billing, pave the way for cost-reflective tariff and provide much-needed cash flow required by the market for value chain performance improvement”.
