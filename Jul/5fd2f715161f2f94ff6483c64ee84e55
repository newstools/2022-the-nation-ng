Di’ja who made her debut as an actor in Dr Sid’s latest movie ’The Order of Things’, spoke about her role saying, “I am on the soundtrack of this movie, my role in the movie, the character she is amazing, she switches up, she has two personalities which for me was something I had to dig deep insight to try to bring that out. Life is moving in very interesting ways, but I am working on a project and I think this project that I am on is a blessing, it is one of those things where I am trying to broaden my horizon and also get better in art in general and I think acting is an amazing part of the entertainment. I’m very grateful to the actors on set that welcomed me and were giving me tips because acting is not easy. If you know me I work hard.”
