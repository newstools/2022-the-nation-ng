The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has approved the deployment of 1,500 personnel and 35 vehicles for Saturday’s election. This is contained in a statement issued by the Assistant Corps Marshal (ACM) Bisi Kazeem, the corps’ Public Education Officer, (CPEO), in Abuja. Corps Marshal, Dr Boboye Oyeyemi, was quoted as saying that the deployment became necessary as part of preparations toward ensuring a hitch-free poll. He directed operatives of the corps drafted for the election to ensure effective collaboration with the Police. This, Oyeyemi said, included the INEC and other security agencies in the enforcement of restrictions on vehicular movement.   2023: North West APC backs Tinubu-Shettima’s ticket     Pan African Farmers Organisation appoints Nigerian CEO     Banditry: Extend security forces’ retirement age,…   “To ensure that the corps plays an effective role in the elections, 1500 personnel of the corps have been deployed. “A total of 35 vehicles, including tow trucks and ambulances, to strengthen enforcement of restrictions during the entire process of the election too have been put in place,” the corps marshal said. He said that the operatives drafted to cover the election had equally been mandated to clear obstructions from the roads. The corps marshal urged the corps operatives to carry out rescue operations in case of emergencies and maintain orderliness at the polling centres. Oyeyemi, however, warned the deployed personnel to exhibit the highest sense of professionalism, and ingenuity, as well as to avoid any situation that could lead to abuse of the rights of electorates during the exercise. He urged the electorate to comply with all regulations, including the restriction of vehicular movement order that would be announced and wished them a peaceful, free and fair election.
