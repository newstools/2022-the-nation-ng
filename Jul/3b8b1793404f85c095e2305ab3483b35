The apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, has urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to conduct free, fair and credible elections in 2023. The organisation’s National Vice President General for the Southeast, Ichie Damian Okeke-Ogene, said this in a statement yesterday in Awka, the Anambra State capital. Okeke-Ogene said Nigerians were eager to see INEC keep to its word on conducting fair and credible elections, adding that the electorate was tired of systems failure and rigging during every election.   Buhari: ‘Something to remember me by’     Choosing to act     Double jeopardy? Just as well!   The Ohanaeze chieftain hailed the leadership of Pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, led by elder statesman, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, and the Convener of Pan-Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) and Ijaw leader, Chief Edwin Clark, for consistently speaking about issues that affect Nigerians. He said Southwest and Southsouth socio-cultural organisations had always spoken against what he called the injustice meted out to the Southeast and had been supporting agitations for equity, fairness and good conscience in the polity. Okeke-Ogene described Adebanjo and Clark as models of elder statesmen. He said the Labour Party (LP) presidential candidate, Mr. Peter Obi, represents the face of a new Nigeria without any ethnic coloration, adding that the Ndigbo would give him the necessary support and encouragement to actualise his political aspirations.
