Lagos State has sympathised with residents over the heavy flash flooding experienced in many parts of the state, including Oko-Oba in Agege. It urged everyone to remain vigilant and cautious. A statement by Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources, Tunji Bello, said the flash flooding on the old Oko-Oba Road followed the ceaseless rainfall of over 10 hours, which led to the overflowing of the Oko-Oba canal Channel which is presently undergoing expansion.

He explained that the government has always advised motorists and residents to be cautious and refrain from wading through flood waters because of the dangers inherent in it. According to Bello, the contractor handling the expansion project was slowed down by the intensity of the rains in the past weeks, but is committed to completing the project. He also reminded the people that the coastal nature of Lagos makes it prone to flooding, especially during heavy rainfall. Bello appealed to residents to be cautious as Lagos will experience more heavy rains till the end of August, and also warned against wading through flood.
