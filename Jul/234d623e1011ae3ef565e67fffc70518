Super Falcons striker Rasheedat Ajibade said that they will be ready for the Indomitable Lionesses of Cameroon in Thursday’s quarterfinal duel of the 2022 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco. Ajibade scored a goal and had three assists in the Falcons’ 4-0 demolition of the Swallows of Burundi on Sunday night in the final Group C tie to ensure Nigeria cruise to the last eight as second in the group behind the Banyana Banyana of South Africa who won all their group games. “We know that we will be up against a tough side and we shall be ready for them. We know for us to be champions again we must be able to beat all the teams we face,” the Atletico Madrid attacker said. “I am excited to play the way I did and to score and create opportunities for my teammates. We knew we must score as many goals as possible to help boost our confidence ahead of the next game with Cameroon,” she added. Meanwhile, Super Falcons head coach, Randy Waldrum has accepted that the team’s second half performance in the win over Burundi was awful and he pinned the blame on the substitutes he introduced to give some of the regulars room to rest ahead of next game. Waldrum said: “Yes we were better in the first half, but maybe the changes in the second half affected our play. “There’s a lot we need to work on, we can be better and we will sort some of these things out before the quarterfinals.”     Ebi rules out forceful Falcons’ exit     Falcons’ target is winning WAFCON title, says Ohale     Ronaldo not for sale, insists Ten Hag   QUARTER-FINAL PAIRINGS Tomorrow Zambia Vs Senegal 6:00pm (Casablanca) Morocco Vs Botswana 9:00pm (Rabat) Thursday Cameroon Vs Nigeria 6:00pm (Casablanca) South Africa Vs Tunisia 9:00pm (Rabat)
