Market women should speak up and not cover up perpetrators of SGVB.” She noted that from evidence, mediation and settling cases of SGBV out of court has not deterred  perpetrators of gender based violence as many of them go about defiling girls and women without restraints. She posited that cases of gender based violence should be reported to the police, more importantly, the gender desk within the police stations so that the law will take its course against such acts.
