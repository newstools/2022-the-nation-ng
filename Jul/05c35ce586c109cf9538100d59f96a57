The new kit is produced by UK kit maker, MG Sportswear; laying to rest the story making the round that Team Nigeria made a last-minute kit for Team Nigeria.

First, the agency got it wrong by attributing it to the entire contingent when the contract for the job was from the AFN. “We have produced top quality kits for the athletes and got delivery of them on Friday. The kits will also be used by our athletes going for the World U20 Athletics Championships in Cali, Colombia.” The AFN President assures that the federation will soon sign a lucrative deal with a sportswear and equipment company very soon.
