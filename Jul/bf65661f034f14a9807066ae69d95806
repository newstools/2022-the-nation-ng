Last Tuesday, the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), through its Board of Trustees Chairman, Senator Walid Jibrin, threatened to expose former President Olusegun Obasanjo if he didn’t clarify his comment about his former deputy Atiku Abubakar within 48 hours. The ultimatum given the ‘Ebora Owu’ expired last Thursday and not a few Nigerians are disappointed that neither PDP nor Jibrin has said a word about exposing the former president as promised.   ‘My abductors cut my long hair with machete, fearing it was…     When marriage isn’t sitcom…Funke Akindele’s second marriage…     Who is afraid of Muslim-Muslim ticket?   Obasanjo had the previous weekend said he made a mistake when he picked his running mate ahead of the 1999 presidential election. Atiku, who is now presidential candidate of PDP, was Vice President from 1999 to 2007. The former president added that God saved him from the ‘genuine mistake’ he made when he selected his deputy. Reacting to the statement, Jibrin warned Obasanjo to clarify his comment to avoid being exposed, saying PDP would tell Nigerians who Obasanjo really. But long after the deadline Obasanjo has neither clarified his statement nor debunked it, yet mum has been the word from Jibrin and PDP. Sentry even gathered from party sources that the BoT Chariman was scolded by a number of prominent chieftains for daring the Balogun of Owu at a crucial time like this. As it is, OBJ may have nothing to fear as neither PDP nor Jibrin appear ready to challenge him to a fight just yet.
