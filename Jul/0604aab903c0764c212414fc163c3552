Reality TV star, Erica Nlewedim aka Star girl, has cursed the thief who pilfered a large sum of dollars from her handbag in a UK store.

She said after shopping and queuing to make payment, she realised her bag was totally empty when it was her turn to pay. Irked at the incident, the actress swore that the thief would never make as much as 10% of the sum they stole in their entire life.
