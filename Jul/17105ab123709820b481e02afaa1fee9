A former presidential aspirant and a chieftain of the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC), Mr. Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim, has counselled opinion moulders not to allow religion to worsen the already divided country. In a statement by his media office in Abuja, Olawepo-Hashim noted that the political aspiration of anybody is not worth the disruption of the unity and peace of Nigeria. He said: “While we all have the right to express ourselves, we should avoid incendiary comments that can further pose huge challenge to our national integration objectives.   Buhari: ‘Something to remember me by’     Choosing to act     Double jeopardy? Just as well!   “Let us quietly make our decisions and express such decisions with our votes.” The business mogul said political parties that are insensitive to national concerns and take some segments of the population for granted must be punished by the electorate at the polls. “That is democracy. There is no need for quarrel,” he said. Olawepo-Hashim maintained that every party must work hard towards the general election to ensure that they are in good reckoning with the electorate at the polls. “Those who have bought delegates must know they will have an uphill task buying estimated 40 million potential voters who may turn out at the next election,” he said.
