I come from the country Of the Happiest People on earth, Where death sells at ten for one kobo And the Living envy the peace Of the hastily dispatched. Living every day on the edge of the knife Suffering all night at the mercy of the bullet Taunted and tossed from wall to wall Foodless, drinkless, and faint from fright Lean like a line from the book of anguish Hunger has a seat in my little hovel My growling stomach is the devil’s drum   SNAPSONG 161     SNAPSONG 160     Nigeria Bleeds…   I count the stars from my lowly bed The lightest shower unravels my roof When geckoes snore in my bedroom wall The cockroaches tremble in their shining coats I do not know when last a smile Stumbled between my lips A shark can shuffle through the ocean of my tears. Sadness lives in the furrows on my forehead Yes, I come from the country Of the happiest people on earth The thunder of our laughter Rips through the ears of the world
