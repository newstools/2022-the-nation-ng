Governor Oyetola at the weekend prayed that he will be re-elected as governor on July 16. The governor, who prayed at the Osogbo Central Eid prayer ground at Oke-Baale, Osogbo, admonished residents on the need to eschew statements that can cause violence, and also to reject inducement of any kind.   Why I selected Shettima as running mate, by Tinubu     Oyetola to Adeleke: your mandate was not stolen     Obi-dient tyrants?   He said: “I implore everyone not to engage in violence during the election. Voting is to elect our leaders but we must not let it snowball to crisis. “I pray for free and fair election devoid of violence. Our state will witness tremendous development. I so pray that I will witness next year’s Sallah as governor.”
