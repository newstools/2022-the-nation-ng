Media personality-cum-actress Destiny Amaka has advised married men to allow their children to undergo Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) regardless of the resemblance between fathers and children. Hammering on the importance of having DNA, Amaka maintained that most children from side chicks are often more related to the man compared to children from the legally married wife. She wrote: “My brothers and uncles and cousins all know how I deal with this. Fuck emotions and sentiments oh MEN! I don’t care how long you’ve been married I know why I’m saying this oooo unless you don’t care. Nigga go do dna test for all your children period.! Even if you feel the child looks like you, my friend will you go and do DNA! Look kwa! Hmmm let me not talk too much but after a while, they will start saying the child looks like a distant relative blah blah blah “Better to have peace of mind than to doubt and if child ain’t yours if your heart can handle it biko continue to be a good parent to that child   I look like old retired ‘prostitute’ on Android…     I’m proudly gay, says actor Maduagwu     I’m working on collabo with Burna Boy, Tu Face, Wizkid…   “Sometimes that side chick that born for you and you do DNA test for but abandon the child because you don’t want to break your marriage biko that child is probably more related to you than the ones born in your house. Dear Men, go do DNA for ALL your children. E get why! Hmm.” Amaka urged women to open up as regards the rightful father of a child even if who seems to be a father might actually not be. She added: “And women I ain’t against you ohh but honestly the truth sets you free… Holding lies this big can age you real fast.. Don’t be deceived ooo not all men will send you packing, plenty of men are living knowing some of his children aint his. Not all men leave when you cheat. Biko I know too many that have not left pls let the truth give y’all peace of mind.” Attachments area
