He said, “Preliminary investigation revealed that the suspects pose as police officers, hire commercial motorcycle riders whose motorcycles look new to a location where one of the syndicate members poses as an Assistant Superintendent of Police, dispossess the rider of his motorcycle, and zoom off. “The suspects confessed to have snatched over 30 motorcycles from commercial motorcycle riders via the same technique, produced fake receipts and sell them off to unsuspecting members of the public.”
