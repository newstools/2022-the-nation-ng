The Redeemed Christian Church of God (Jesus Embassy) in Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State, is planning to build a maternity and school in Ado-Ekiti. Provincial pastor in charge of Ekiti Seven Gabriel Adarabioyo stated this yesterday at the inauguration of a 2,500 capacity auditorium. According to him, the vision was to win more souls that will be heavenly-focused and bring about a saner society. Adarabioyo said embarking on the project was borne out of the desire to see a church that will be filled with saved souls, those who will always exhibit ‘Christ-like’ attitudes that will make Ekiti, Nigeria and the world a better place for all and sundry.

I had a vision of turning the small building I met on my arrival to a Cathedral. This building foundation was laid on March 16, 2019, and completed in July 2022, after spending about N100 million. “We got N20 million from the RCCG’s national body, while N1.7 million was from Region 25, and the remaining was internally generated by the province. Today, the dedication of this house of God is a dream come through. “If Jesus tarries, the province is proposing a maternity home, a school and crèche that will start soonest for the benefit of Ekiti people and Nigeria in general.” The dedication was done by the Pastor-In-Charge of Region 25, Goke Kuti. Kuti, in his sermon titled ‘From Zero to Hero’, citing 1Samuel 2:8, prayed for multiple celebrations, wonders and answers to prayers in the auditorium.
