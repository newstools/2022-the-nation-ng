Rangers legend Barry Ferguson thinks the Light Blues should do everything to keep Calvin Bassey at Ibrox and insisted the Nigerian international’s performances last season left him in awe. Bassey has been linked with a number of clubs over the summer but Ferguson believes that another year at Ibrox will really help his development ahead of an inevitable move to the Premier League. The Super Eagles star has quickly become one of Rangers’ most important players and Ferguson is desperate to see him stick around in Glasgow a while longer. “I’d chain him up,” Ferguson said [Go Radio Football Show]. “Anything just to make sure he doesn’t leave. “Last year I was in awe of him, I’ve got to be honest with you.

He can play a number of positions, he can play left-back, he can play left wing-back and he can play left of a three or left of a two. “His engine is frightening and he’s just getting better and better and better. “If I was going to give him a bit of advice, he should stay and keep playing week-in and week-out because his chance will come if he wants to go down south to the Premier League, there’s no doubt about it. “But for his development, it’s important he stays at Rangers for another year and I’m sure Rangers will be trying to tie him down on a long-term contract to get the best money for next season or the season after.”
