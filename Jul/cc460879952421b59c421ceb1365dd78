Former presidential aide Reno Omokri has urged individuals to take a cue from Davido’s personality. Omokri commended Davido for the laudable role he played in ensuring the victory of his uncle, Ademola Adeleke at the Saturday, July 16 Osun polls. He indulged individuals to understudy and emulate the Adeleke family, especially the DMW boss who used their influence and wealth to support one of their own.

Use your influence and money to support your family. Build each other up. Don’t tear each other down. Don’t wash your dirty linen in public. Do not even let your wives or husbands come between you and your BLOOD family. Unite. Don’t divide. Be greater together. Don’t let the hater be the victor. Congratulations goes to the entire Adeleke family! “Senator Adeleke won partly because of Davido. Going forward, Davido will win more because of Governor Adeleke. But look at your family. Whatever energy, money, and influence you have is dedicated to pulling each other down. Learn from the Adelekes! “How many celebrities could have done for their families what Davido did for his? Some even publicly fight their blood brothers. Others fight their own birth parents. Moral of the story: One family member who is committed to you is better than millions of fans who are interested in you,” he said.
