Umar Sadiq has announced his retirement from boxing two years after suffering a traumatic brain injury The former Team Nigeria pugilist suffered a brutal 12th -round stoppage defeat by former world super-middleweight title challenger Fedor Chudinov in Russia in September 2020. Sadiq was hospitalised after suffering a subdural haematoma – a bleed to the brain – in his short-notice bout with the Russian. The 34-year-old survived the horrific ordeal and continued to box against the wishes of the British Board of Boxing Control, although he’s since hung up his gloves in order to punch his way into Hollywood. “Medical professionals tell me I’m lucky to be healthy.

Although his ill-fated clash with Chudinov essentially ushered him out of the ring, Sadiq has no regrets about taking the short-notice fight. He said: “My fight against Chudinov was an opportunity I couldn’t pass by, especially when it was someone I felt I had the beating of but then the fight was only confirmed seven days before the fight. “I had to get visas, get to Russia. I had a great fight, great performance. Ref stopped it in the 12th round rightfully so.”
