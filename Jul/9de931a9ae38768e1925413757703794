No one can doubt that Akwa Ibom Governor Udom Emmanuel would want to celebrate his 56th birthday without fanfare, especially in the aftermath of his presidential run. He is a man of Christian conscience and one of the sterling performers of this era with all he has done in about eight years of his stewardship to trsnaform Akwa Ibom. As he stamps his legacy, In Touch wishes him a happy birthday.
