Tyson Fury has promised to sign a contract to fight Anthony Joshua – but only if it’s for free. The Gypsy King vowed he will come out of retirement for a mouth-watering battle of Britain clash against Joshua. Fury initially said earlier this year that his sixth round knockout win over Dillian Whyte in April was his final fight. Then in a stunning U-turn he then revealed he would return to fight Joshua for half a BILLION pounds, before suggesting he would do the fight for nothing. He has now reiterated that any future dust up with AJ has to be for free – and he is ready to sign a contract for the bout. Fury, 33, said on his Instagram: “This is reconfirmation on what I’ve said about fighting Anthony Joshua for f*** all in England. “That’s how the fight happens, I’ll sign the contract today. The fight’s got to be for free. Free-to-air television and all tickets go for free. “No money is to be made out of this British historic fight if it happens.

Despite Joshua, 32, losing to Usyk, 35, last September, Fury wants his countryman to avenge the defeat so they can set up a British blockbuster. Fury and AJ have been going back-and-forth with each other for years, and even agreed to fight each other last summer. That’s until the bout was scuppered after Deontay Wilder won his legal bid for a trilogy fight with Fury. Now though Fury has promised a fight will go ahead – but only if Joshua agrees to his terms
