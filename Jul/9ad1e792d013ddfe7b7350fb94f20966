Manchester City have signed Arminia Bielefeld goalkeeper Stefan Ortega on a three-year deal. The 29-year-old joins the English Premier League (EPL) champions as back-up to Ederson after his deal expired with the recently-relegated Bundesliga side. U.S. international Zack Steffen was number two last season but he is now reportedly set to join Middlesbrough on loan. Ortega is Manchester City’s second window signing, following star striker Erling Haaland’s high-profile arrival from Borussia Dortmund. “This is a fantastic move for me,” German goalkeeper Ortega said. “Manchester City are an amazing team — a squad with world-class quality in every area. “To be given the chance to join this group of players and help continue the club’s success is a dream for me. “I have enjoyed my time in Germany and I want to thank the Arminia Bielefeld fans for their support.

So, it’s a transfer we are really pleased to have secured.” (dpa/NAN)
