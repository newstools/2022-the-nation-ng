But, a mix-up lands him in a room belonging to Diokpa (Charley Boy), a local criminal Lord. What Joseph finds in Diokpa’s room changes his life and that of his friend Josiah (Josh2Funny) thus sparking a game of cat and mouse with Diokpa tracing the two Joes to Lagos where they have become the biggest boys in town. On the inspiration for the film, the veteran filmmaker said he had always hoped to bring more comic characters to life following his comedy film Onye Ozi. “After a few years of biopics, dramas, and the likes, I thought it was time to work on an action-packed comedy with memorable characters.”
