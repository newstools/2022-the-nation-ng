Rap artiste Cosmas Okechukwu Nnotum has given an insight on how God inspires him to churn out wave-making music. The musician, on his Instagram page, said: “God inspired me to make music, I always have the belief that God personally gave me the great musical talent I possess. “It’s one of the reasons why I could take a 10 year hiatus away from the game and still come back stronger as if I never left.”   I look like old retired ‘prostitute’ on Android…     I’m proudly gay, says actor Maduagwu     I’m working on collabo with Burna Boy, Tu Face, Wizkid…   He also said, being a hip hop lover, his favorite artistes are Biggy, 2 Pac, Lil Wayne and Drake. “I’m a basic lover of any sound that is sweet to my ears. “Taking a 10 year break from music seems to have been the magic wand, as I came back bigger, ahead of my contemporaries,” Nnotum said. Nnotum, who has posted most of his lyrics on his Instagram handle @Supaakos, said music has always been a way of life for him.
