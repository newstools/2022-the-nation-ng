Actor-cum-model Tayo Faniran has argued Nigeria roads are deserving of tractors not fancy cars. He identified the demerits of possessing fancy cars in Nigeria which include having to contend with potholes, flooding and ‘useless’ reckless drivers or divers. Faniran argued as a result of regular traffic on the roads, one will barely get the opportunity to maximally enjoy all the features of a fancy car, especially that of speed. The reality TV star recommended that everyone rather owned tractors noting that way, not just individuals but also their money would be protected.

You don’t need the speed because you will be in traffic anyway, but this tractor will definitely protect you and your money.”
