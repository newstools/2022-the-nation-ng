The Colleges of Education Academic Staff Union (COEASU) has extended its warning strike by another three weeks to allow the Federal Government to meet its demands. The National Executive Council of the union took the decision during a meeting at the Federal College of Education, Kano on July 19, 2022. COEASU first declared a four week national warning strike on 10th June, 2022 to press home its demands. Although the union agreed that some progress had been made, particularly in the areas of revitalisation, it said the extension would provide the government the time to meet the remaining demands.

The NEC welcomed the on-going mobilisation by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) for a national protest to get our children back to school in solidarity with the struggle of Trade Unions in the nation’s tertiary institutions. “While applauding the Labour Centre for this promising intervention, NEC posited that the strike action should be sustained and charged Chapters to participate in the mass protest,” the statement added.
