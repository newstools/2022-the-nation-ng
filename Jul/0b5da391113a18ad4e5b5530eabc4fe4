The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has alleged that its leader, Nnamdi Kanu, is  being subjected to psychological trauma and torture in the confinement of the Department of State Services ( DSS) in Abuja. The group accused the DSS of continued flouting and violating the existing court orders by justice Binta Nyako concerning Kanu. In a statement by its Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, IPOB warned that it would not accept any “stage-managed” attack by DSS agents targeted at its leader.

Solitary confinement is a torture under UN Law. Justice Binta made a court order that Mazi Nnamdi Kanu should be visited twice a week, Mondays and Thursdays by his lawyers, family members and visitors of his choice. “We want to make it known to all and sundry that our leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu is now being allowed to see his visitors for only 30 minutes in contravention of the competent court order that approved two hours per visit by his lawyers and family members. “We want to remind DSS of their required obligations some of which are to abide by stipulated court orders and procedures in handling all matters associated with our leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu so as to minimise unforseen circumstantial consequences should anything goes wrong.
