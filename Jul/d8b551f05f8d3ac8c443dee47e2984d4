MUSIC sensation and songwriter, Chukwuemeka Okorie aka PrayzzZ has described Afrobeats as the biggest genre in the world. According to the singer, who was born and raised in Lagos in a musical family, there is nothing impossible for African artists to achieve. “A lot has changed since my first official release in 2017. Our music is now the biggest thing in the world,” PrayzzZ boasted.   Nollywood needs more funding, says Wale Muraina     Real Housewives Of Lagos: Laura vindicated, Chioma parts way…     ‘I get my story from real life experiences’   Continuing the ‘Feels & Good Vibes’ the singer said, “Every day there is a new milestone being hit, new limits being pushed. It’s such an amazing time to be African. That a young artist like myself can create music that gets accepted and enjoyed worldwide, in places I haven’t been to yet, places I never even knew about until we saw the data, is something I’ll never take for granted.” Unlike parents who discouraged their kids from delving into music, PrayzzZ expressed satisfaction over his parents’ support in pursuing a career in entertainment. “Both my dad and mom played a huge role in my music career. Most of my earliest memories are of my dad rehearsing and performing with his band and sometimes alone. The music I grew up listening to through him still plays a part in how I make music to date. He taught me to never be boxed into one sound.” His recent body of work titled, ‘Lucid’ tells a pan-African love story in a production style. The official visualizer of the classic tune, which was released on May 11, has garnered 50,762 views on Youtube.
