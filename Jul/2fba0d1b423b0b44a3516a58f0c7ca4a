McLaughlin has set the last three of them. This record broke McLaughlin’s world record of 51.41 seconds set on June 25 at the U.S. Outdoor Championships. “I think I’ve always had a really awesome relationship with Hayward Field,” McLaughlin said. “Every time I come here, I just feel like I run really great races. Being able to have World Championships here on U.S. soil was really special already. “Just knowing that I’m in the same time zone I train in, and all of the advantages of having it on home soil, I think it really played to our advantage. I couldn’t be happier with how things turned out.”
