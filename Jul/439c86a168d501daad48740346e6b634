Rapper Emeka Akumefule aka Blaqbonez has lauded Grammy-winning singer, Burna Boy for the remarkable publicity of his works on several media platforms. Mr. Boombastic, who released his latest album, “Behold the Lamb”, on July 6 commended Burna for the enviable work he’s been doing with his latest album “Love Damini”. “Love Damini” Odogwu’s sixth studio album released on July 8 has continued to attract positive comments. The impressive 19-track body of work boasts of two hit singles – “Kilometre” and “Last Last,” which samples Toni Braxton’s classic ‘He Wasn’t Man Enough’ of which she would be getting 60 percent royalties from the song.

Wow!”
