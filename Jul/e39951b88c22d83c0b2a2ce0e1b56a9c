Arsenal have been urged to prioritise a move for Lazio midfielder Sergej Milinkovic-Savic ahead of Leicester City man Youri Tielemans this summer. Tielemans’ future at City remains uncertain with the midfielder having just one year remaining on his contract at the King Power Stadium.

And I think Savic is a lovely player. A really top-drawer player.
