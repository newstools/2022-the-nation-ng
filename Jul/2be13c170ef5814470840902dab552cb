Shot-putter Chukwuebuka Enekwechi has admitted  representing ‘Nigeria has been very hard for him’ after finishing 11th in the final of his event at  the  just concluded 2022 World Athletics Championships in Oregon, United States. The 2022 African Champion described his 2022 season as challenging, especially competing in a national trial after the African championships in Mauritius. Enekwechi, whose 20.65m could not take him to the medal podium, is hopeful of better performance at the forthcoming  Commonwealth Games which incidentally  launched him globally after claiming silver in his maiden outing at  Gold Coast 2018 in Australia . “There is a lot of stuff I had to do that made no sense and was detrimental to my plan (for Oregon 22),” Enekwechi told the Making of Champions (MoC) in Oregon yesterday, “The continental championship came before the national championships, and this made no sense at all. To be honest, it killed my moment, as I was building from the start of the season.

Despite making it to the final in Oregon 22, Enekwechi said he was  aiming more than just making the final of his shot-put event. “It is good to be one of the best in the world and you always want the best out of yourself. I am proud to be among the best but I really want to be the best as there is still more to be added,” he noted. Pressed  about the demands of representing Nigeria, he simply said: “It is hard and representing Nigeria is really, really hard.” He however, promised to give his best in Birmingham at the Commonwealth Games.
