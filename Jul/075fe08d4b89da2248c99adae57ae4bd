Popular veteran actor has tagged persons yet to secure their Permanent Voter’s Card (PVC) as part of the problem afflicting the country.

He advised the citizens to intentionally make up their minds to perform their civic duties by voting noting, elections are never done on social media but physically. He argued going out to vote is far better than going to a church or mosque because it’ll save people the stress of having to pray long hours when competent leaders are elected into offices.

You must be there physically. “If by now you have not gotten your Permanent Voter’s Card (PVC), you have become part of the problem of Nigeria. I tell you that.”
