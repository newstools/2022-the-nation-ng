Former Aston Villa striker Gabby Agbonlahor believed there will be plenty of interest in Rangers’ Joe Aribo this summer amid links with Southampton and Crystal Palace. The 25-year-old has been strongly linked with a move to the Premier League, with Aribo now entering the final 12 months of his contract at Ibrox. There has been no progress in recent months over a new deal at Rangers, meaning that as things stand, the Scottish giants run the risk of potentially losing Aribo on a free transfer next summer. As such, several Premier League clubs have been linked with a move to sign the Nigerian international this summer, with Saints, Crystal Palace and Fulham reported being among the potential suitors. Aston Villa have also previously been linked, with Aribo having worked with Villa boss Steven Gerrard during his time as Rangers manager.

Yet former Villa striker Agbonlahor said Aribo would be a good signing for several Premier League sides, citing his goal in the Europa League final for Rangers against Eintracht Frankfurt as an example of what he could offer clubs. Speaking with Football Insider, he said: “There will be clubs interested in Joe Aribo. If there is a £10m release clause I’m sure that will be met because of what he showed in the [Europa League] final with his goal. “Every time I watched him over the last couple of seasons he’s been a player that’s stood out for me. He’s very comfortable on the ball, always shows that work rate, and can play a number of positions. He’s a top player who Rangers will not want to lose, definitely.”
