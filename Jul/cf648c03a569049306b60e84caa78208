The protesting youths carried Ogbonna’s body to the house of the immediate past Interim Management Committee chairman of Oguta LGA, calling on the government to bring his killers to justice. An eyewitness questioned why the Ebubeagu Security operatives should come to arrest a youth without the approval of the police. “They came to arrest a youth but they were questioned if policemen were aware. They started shooting and in the process killed Kelechi Ogbonna. They injured others and they had been hospitalized,” he said. Another youth in the area said that the youths stoned the Ebubeagu operatives and “one of them released a shot that hit the deceased.” Police spokesman CSP Michael Abattam had yet to issue a statement at press time.
