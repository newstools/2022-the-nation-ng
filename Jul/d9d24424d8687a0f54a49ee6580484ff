The National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) has kicked off the e-government service wide capacity building programmes for public servants. The programme is aimed at equipping public servants with digital skills to enhance their performances under the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The Director-General of the agency, Kashifu Inuwa, said the philosophy behind digital inclusion was to ensure that technology or digital skills are driven to the rural areas to support various economic activities, especially farming. Inuwa was represented at the event, which took place at Public Service Institute, Kubwa, Abuja, by the Director, Research and Development of NITDA, Dr Agu Collins Agu. According to him, “technology is dynamic which makes upskilling and reskilling come into play especially for federal public servants that will be driving all government digital transformation”. The Managing Director, Galaxy Backbone Limited and co-Chairman, e-GTC Governing Board, Prof. Mohammed Abubakar, said in 2020, the number of batches trained were 10, while 12 were trained last year. “In 2020 the number of public servants trained were 489 and 890 in 2021, the number of effective training days were 26 and 48 in 2020 and 2021.  The number of effective training hours were 208 in 2020 and 384 in 2021.
