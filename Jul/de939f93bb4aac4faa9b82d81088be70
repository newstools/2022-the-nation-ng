Actress Adebimpe Oyebade-Adedimeji aka Mo’ Bimpe, has clarified the sex-for-role allegation against her colleague Yomi Fabiyi. Mo Bimpe affirmed Fabiyi made advances at her but refuted any sexual involvement with him. She claimed her refusal is responsible for the animosity between them. According to Mo Bimpe, Fabiyi insisted on either dating or being enemies with her and she had to make her choice; choosing the latter.   Buhari: ‘Something to remember me by’     Choosing to act     Double jeopardy? Just as well!   The film star made this known in a question and answer session after a fan probed her over the allegation. The fan asked: “Is it true that you and Yomi dey fight because of sex for role?” Responding, Mo Bimpe said: “NO! In fact, he didn’t ask me out till we finished his movie I featured in (though he said if he knew I was going to turn him down, he would have done that before shooting the movie). “We don’t relate because he insisted on either dating me or being enemies and I had to choose.” This comes barely few days after Fabiyi’s baby mama, Grace Jimoh, got into a heated war of words on social media over sex-for-roles allegations.
