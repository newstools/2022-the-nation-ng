Though the family member wasn’t disclosed by the singer’s team, when they took to social media to intimate his fans and followers of his current health condition, an insider claimed the wife has opted to be the donor. “The wife is donating her kidney for him. All that is left now is to get the money needed for the surgery,” the insider said. The goal of the GoFundMe account was £48,000 but as of the time of filing this report, only £4,269 has been raised by 164 donors.
