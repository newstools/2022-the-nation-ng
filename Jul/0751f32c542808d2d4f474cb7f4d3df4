The Inspector General of Police, Usman Baba, has ordered the arrest and immediate prosecution of movie producers, skit makers, and other individuals found using the police uniform without proper authorisation. In a statement by the Force Public Relations Officer, Olumayowa Adejobi, Baba frowned at how movie producers and skit makers portray the Police institution in their movies and skits without recourse to the provision of Section 251 of the Criminal Code law, and Section 133 of the Penal Code Law which criminalises such unauthorised use. The police boss noted all Commands and formations, including the IGP Monitoring Unit, Provost marshals, and X-Squad, have been instructed to arrest and immediately prosecute all persons engaging in the illegal sales of police uniforms and accouterments within their jurisdictions.

Baba further disclosed the Force Public Relations Officer has been charged with the task of ensuring prompt authorisation for all applications for approvals of usage of police items in movies, in tandem with the extant laws. He said that proper regulation will portray good values, provide police officers with modern innovations to actively carry out policing duties, and will equally make them on-screen role models who would influence their lives and career and consequently enhance security mechanisms in Nigeria.
