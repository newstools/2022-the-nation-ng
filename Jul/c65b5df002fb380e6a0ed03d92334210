He said the boat went under shortly after departing from the jetty, adding that the boat captain was being investigated by relevant agencies. He said: “Two adult female passengers were retrieved unconscious and were transferred to the nearest hospital for treatment. They unfortunately never regained consciousness and were later declared dead. “The boat Captain is currently being investigated by the relevant authorities while an investigation into the cause of this mishap is being carried out by LASWA.” The Nation reports that more boat accidents usually occur during the rainy season as a result of higher water levels, tides which make it harder for operators to identify wrecks and other impediments along the channels.
