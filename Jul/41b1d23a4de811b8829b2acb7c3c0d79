The President of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) Amaju Pinnick, and the 2nd Vice President of the football body, Shehu Dikko, are reportedly facing trouble times in the coming days. Authoritative sources revealed that with the conclusion of all investigations against the two football chieftains, Independent Corrupt Practices Commission (ICPC) is set to drag them to court over alleged corrupt practices. It was learnt that after the corruption agency seems to have gotten the approval of the Presidency, the body embarked on intensive investigations and it is now set to drag Pinnick and Dikko to court over alleged corruption charges even as Pinnick plans to run for a 3rd term as NFF President. The source added that five other chieftains of the football body have various cases to answer following the recent development on various malpractices in the running of football in the country.

The legal department of the ICPC is concluding plans to put up charges against Pinnick and other officials for them to face trial as soon as possible,” the source added. Although the offences of the football chiefs were not spelt out, it is believed that the ICPC is keeping this for strategic reasons. In addition, a source from the ministry said: “The football chieftains receive money appropriated to Nigeria Football Association and spend as Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) but turn around to say “interference” when they owe their existence and recognition because Government turns a blind eye to their illegal status and they still don’t want to obey the laws of the land.”
