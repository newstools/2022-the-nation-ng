NOLLYWOOD producer, Wale Osagie Muraina has made a case for more financing for Nollywood movies. Muraina, who has produced movies like Dear Affy, Mimi, City of Dreams, Kafaya Undercover, Honeymoon Palaver, and P.A from hell, says Nollywood movies cannot compete adequately without proper funding. Speaking at a recent event, Muraina says the fact that he manages funds well and has a reputation of working below budget doesn’t mean the industry can thrive without good funding.   Real Housewives Of Lagos: Laura vindicated, Chioma parts way…     ‘I get my story from real life experiences’     Mr Macaroni, Broda Shaggi, MC Lively star in Survivor   “I know people already tag me as Mr. Fix it of Nollywood. It is true that I have a reputation for managing funds well and working with the budget and left with funds but that should not be mistaken to mean that Nollywood can thrive without good funding.” Continuing, he said, “Filmmaking is business; it is not charity work. People need to get that. You hire men and women who have dependents to come to the movie set and work for 20 days or more, they are professionals, and they should be well paid. Film-making is work. We should first get that out of the way. Look at the way some people live well, drive good cars and take care of their loved ones, filmmakers deserve that as well, so we need to fund the industry.” Muraina also admitted that making a quality film costs huge sums.
