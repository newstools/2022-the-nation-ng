The High Court Judge found Tanko and the second and third accused persons, Hashim Isiyaku and Fatima Musa, guilty in four counts charges in the case of the murder of Hanifa Abubakar last year. Kano Attorney General, Barrister Musa Abdullahi Lawan, who is the prosecution counsel, hailed the verdict (death sentence). He described Hanifa’s murder as a “crime against humanity,” adding that the deceased (victim) deserves justice. Kano residents and other Nigerians angered by the little girl’s murder are anxious to hear and see Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje responds to the judgment. The Governor had earlier pledged to sign the death sentence if passed by the court.
