The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Oyo State has berated Deputy Governor Rauf Olaniyan over his refusal to clear his name of allegations of financial impropriety, abandonment of office, among others, leveled against him by the House of Assembly. The party said approaching the court to restrain the lawmakers from performing their constitutional functions violates every atom of the Yoruba ‘omoluabi’ ethos of Olaniyan. Recall that Olaniyan approached the court to stop the lawmakers from impeaching him, but the House of Assemly directed the Chief Judge, Justice Munta Abimbola, to investigate the allegations against Olaniyan. PDP described the Assembly’s action as the right move in the right direction.

The party maintained that Olaniyan should understand that ‘he who must go to equity must go with clean hands’. The statement reads: “No single individual should, on account of the office they hold in trust for the public, feel or think they are above the law. A man without skeletons in his cupboard should not be afraid to open his cupboard. “As a sitting deputy governor, who should always be seen showing example of leadership, to now be the one displaying sheer executive arrogance, rascality, and brazen disrespect for the legislative arm, is unhealthy for the nation’s democracy.” The party insisted that no amount of delay tactics deployed by Olaniyan in his ‘desperate move to buy more time’ can prevent the lawmakers from carrying out their statutory legislative duties, or avert the course of justice.
