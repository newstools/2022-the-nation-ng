I doff my heart to a true professional, Mike Awoyinfa, who just turned 70. Men like him are rare in a profession. He has brought a revolutionary flair to his trade. He literally gave us a new journalism when he became editor of Weekend Concord. He injected an edgy, vibrant tone to news. He is unmatched in headline casting, giving it a joyous magnificence. Whoever saw Mike’s headline can compare it to a box of candies. He knows how to make something out of nothing in news and he does not fear to humble the powerful.   From CAN to cant     Atiku: an open Pharisee     The case for Shettima   In this age of bigotry, his best friend, an Igbo, was the blessed Dimgba Igwe, a man who was a twin to him and lived next door until death snatched the great Dimgba. Mike is a great human being, a soulful columnist, a man of letters. May he continue to flourish.
