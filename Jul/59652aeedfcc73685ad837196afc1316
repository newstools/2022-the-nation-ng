Ayade, who won the ticket unopposed, was elected yesterday at a fresh primary election in Ogoja Local Government Area. The election followed the voluntary withdrawal of Mr. Martins Orim, who won the ticket at the May 28 primaries. Chairperson of the APC Primary Election Committee for Cross River North, Mrs. Sameera Tabo, declared the governor winner with 252 votes. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the total votes cast was 255, while three votes were invalidated.   Buhari: ‘Something to remember me by’     Choosing to act     Double jeopardy? Just as well!   According to Mrs. Tabo, following Orim’s withdrawal, the fresh primary election was to ensure that the party fielded a candidate for Cross River North, as stipulated in the Electoral Act. In his acceptance speech, Ayade expressed gratitude to the delegates for electing him. He said after running for the office of the president of Nigeria, he returned home and then came under pressure from his people to contest for Senate. “They said I did very well when I was a senator from 2011 to 2015 and insisted I go back; today I have answered their call. “Of course, they recognised that this country requires a legislator that has both executive and legislative experience. “I am very experienced. I know the challenges of our people and possess the essential elements that will help us make the appropriate laws and legislation that will change the narrative of our people,” he said.
