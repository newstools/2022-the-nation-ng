An FCT High Court in Kubwa, ordered Jubrin Buba, an Official of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps to enter his defence without delay. The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) charged Buba with six counts bordering on forgery. Justice Asmau Akanbi-Yusuf, overruled the no-case submission earlier made by the defendant and held that there was a prima facie case against him. Akanbi-Yusuf however ordered the defendant to enter his defence accordingly and adjourned the matter until Oct.10 for hearing. The Defence Counsel, James Paul had argued in a motion dated Feb.8 that the ingredients of the offence against the defendant had not been proven by the prosecution counsel, Aniekan Ekong. He added that the exhibits tendered before the court were photocopies and urged the court to sustain his arguments and discharge the defendant of the charges against him.
