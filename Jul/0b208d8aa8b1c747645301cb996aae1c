Actor Yul Edochie has complained after super Eagles Captain, Ahmed Musa reposted his quote without acknowledging him. The popular actor on Tuesday made a post chiding the political office holders for not having fate in the system by sending their children to overseas schools with youths celebrating such leaders on their return. The post reads: “To our political office holders whose children school abroad. “How do you feel visiting your children abroad, taking pictures in their schools and posting online when ASUU is on strike? Like seriously, how is it ok to you? “You’re running a system that you don’t even believe in. “Show me one Oyibo leader whose children is schooling g in Nigeria. E no dey touch una?   Depression notifies me when to switch my style – Rema     I’m inspired by Burna Boy’s tenancity – Blaqbonez     I’m a proud prostitute, says Tacha   “And when you return, Nigerian youths will gather and sing praises for una.” Musa reposted and a blog attributed the post to the superstar footballer, prompting Yul’s reaction for having been sidelined on the post he originally created. Yul shared a screenshot of the blog’s post explaining Musa did nothing wrong to have used his post but was certainly wrong not to have credited him. “Na me think am, write am post for my pages this morning. “My brother Ahmed Musa munch am post for him own page without giving me credit for it. E good? “We all want a working Nigeria. Nothing wrong with copy and paste but you should give credit to the writer,” he wrote.
