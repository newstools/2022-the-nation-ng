The Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) has condemned the United Nations’ call for the unconditional release of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). CNG also said that the United Nations explicitly show preference to some sections of the Nigerian society with greater bias whenever matters arising from or affecting the northern part of the country are placed before it. Spokesman of CNG, Abdul-Azeez Suleiman, who stated this at the press briefing in Abuja, urged the United Nations to immediately withdraw the call for the unconditional release of Nnamdi Kanu from the lawful custody of the Nigerian authorities.   2023: Why all Yoruba should vote Tinubu     Burna Boy, Future headline Canadian concert     ‘Coup can’t solve Nigeria’s problem’   The coalition called on the Federal Government to maintain the sanctity, dignity, and integrity of Nigeria to defend its sovereignty by resisting and rejecting demands from any quarter. He said: “It is unacceptable to Nigeria and Nigerians, and in particular to the North, that the United Nations will endorse the platform and space to be used by Kanu and IPOB in promoting anarchy and campaigning for genocide in Nigeria.” “Demand the United Nations to direct all member nations where Kanu, IPOB, and other authors of mindless violence and separatism find comfortable cover to perpetuate an agenda that fans the embers of discord, call for war and violence in Nigeria, to take action in line with their domestic laws on hate speech and international laws on war and genocide instead of accommodating them.
