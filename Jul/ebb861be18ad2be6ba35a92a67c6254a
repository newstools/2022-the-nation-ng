The Catholic Church in Nigeria (Lagos Archdiocese) has rejected the new abortion guidelines in the state. Catholic Archbishop of Lagos, Rev. Adewale Martins described the government’s claim that it consulted all stakeholders in the guidelines’ preparation process as untrue. The cleric added that the church will not lend itself to any process aimed at terminating the life of a baby in the womb. The Ministry of Health last Tuesday unveiled a 40-page policy document tagged ‘Lagos State guidelines on Safe Termination of Pregnancy for Legal Indications’. But the Church expressed its displeasure with the guidelines in a statement by the Director of Social Communications, Fr. Anthony Godonu.

There is nothing like an unwanted child because every child is a gift from God that should be nurtured and allowed to grow in fulfilment of their purpose in life. “We need to continue to explore ways of providing support for those women who find themselves in difficulty as a result of their pregnancy, rather than thinking of aborting an innocent child. “Any attempt to terminate the life of the unborn child is tantamount to murder and should be treated as a capital offence. Our focus, therefore, should be on proper enlightenment on human sexuality and collaboration in order to support women who get pregnant without being ready for the pregnancy.”
