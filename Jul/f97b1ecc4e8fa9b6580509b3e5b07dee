Habiba Olatundun, a UK-based singer and songwriter has opened up about her source of inspiration and career. In a recent chat, she said, “I am a singer and songwriter. I am just obsessed with my music in general. I have been doing music for as long as I can remember. I used to have a recorder which my uncle gave me and I would record melodies and all the songs on the tape recorder and then I got a laptop and I would make beats and also make beats on my iPod and I would have random freestyle sessions and that was how I met the first producer that I worked with on my first EP.” Continuing, she said, “I am inspired by old school artists like Brandy, Beyonce, Ciara, and new school acts like Samuel Walker, Bella, Tiana Major 9 and like R&B and soul singers.   Edochie’s first wife shrugs off marriage drama     Faze, Konga, others thrill at Ruggedman’s Foundation night     Adaorah shines at BET awards   I professionally started in 2018, that was when I recorded my first project. It was called Blue Olympus and I named it after the first recording device that I used in recording my songs it was kind of at the rough edges and was trying to figure out where I would put myself in the music industry. As an upcoming act, she says it has been challenging yet exciting. “A lot of up-and-coming acts will tell you it is not about talent but more about resources, who you know and what and where you can get into to get the big break and what you can do with your music. However, we live in an age where you can use social media and the internet to upload and put your content where you want it to be seen. It is a learning curve but I would say it has been fun. I love people’s responses to songs that I have written, especially because I don’t necessarily write songs with the intention of people hearing them. It was kind of person but I am glad I got the push to push it out.”
