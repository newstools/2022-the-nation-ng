European giants Manchester United and Bayern Munich are preparing for life after the respective departures of two of their most prized possessions – Cristiano Ronaldo and Robert Lewandowski – both incidentally being star strikers who rack in the numbers and are keeping tabs on Victor Osimhen. Both clubs have in mind the idea of bringing in a capable young marksman to lead the line, and Napoli prodigy is one of the first names to ring around.

The buzz in Naples all points towards the Nigerian staying put, including boss Luciano Spalletti, who is ready to count on him in 2022/23. Ronaldo has handed the Red Devils a transfer request, reportedly seeking an exit if an apt offer arrives in the English club’s coffers. The lack of UEFA Champions League football is one of the ex-Juventus man’s main concerns, where Lewandowski’s rapport with the German giants has encountered a total meltdown in recent weeks. The young striker still has a good two years in his belt at Napoli, if not more. He showcased his skills and marksmanship last season – banging 18 goals in 32 appearances for the Partenopei – his most prolific in terms of goals per game ratio. A move to either club would be a step up, but he is already gelled well to how Serie A functions.
