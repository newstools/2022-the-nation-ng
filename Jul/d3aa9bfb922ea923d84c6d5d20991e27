Boxing fans are fuming after it was revealed that Anthony Joshua’s rematch with heavyweight champion Oleksandr Usyk will set a new record as the highest pay-per-view cost in UK television history. Joshua is seeking to reclaim his heavyweight title against Usyk on August 20 with the pair taking to the ring in Saudi Arabia, but some, according to the Daily Mail, fans have insisted they won’t be tuning in to watch the title bout. Sky Sports will once again stream the heavyweight title clash despite Joshua signing an exclusive agreement with broadcaster DAZN after Sky won the rights to stream the fight for a reported £25million. Sky have increased the PPV cost to £27 for the upcoming fight which is £2 more expensive than the last bout between the two heavyweight stars, and sets a new record as the most expensive fight in British boxing history.
