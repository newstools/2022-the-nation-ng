The President of the Court of Appeal, Justice Monica Dongban-Mensem, has lost another son, Prince Paeke Shapnaan. Paeke, her second son, died in his sleep on Saturday. The 38-year-old got married recently. He studied Mathematics at the Federal University of Technology, Minna, Niger State, and was an official of the Federal Ministry of Transport in Lagos. The deceased was billed to start his graduate programme in Maritime studies on September 13. The tragic incident occurred 11 years after another son of the Appeal Court President, Samson Kwapda’as, was killed by a hit-and-run driver.

The judge had set up the Kwapda’as Road Safety Demand Foundation in honour of her first son.
