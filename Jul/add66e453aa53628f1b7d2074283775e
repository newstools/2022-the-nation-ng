A middle-aged man, Kosara Ugwuka, has allegedly killed his elder brother with rat poison over land dispute in Akala village in Ezinifite, Nnewi South Local Government Area of Anambra State. Ugwuka was said to have publicly confessed being responsible for the mysterious death of the deceased, Mr. Chukwudi Ugwuka, before a shrine at Nando in Anambra East Local Government Area. It was gathered that the incident happened last Easter while the deceased was eventually confirmed dead on April 27, 2022 after battling series of mysterious sicknesses from one hospital to the other. Narrating the incident to the Nation on Tuesday, a family member who pleaded anonymity said Ugwuka initially denied knowledge of his brother’s death until he was taken the shrine. He said: “But when both of them were repeatedly interrogated, the nephew maintained that he is innocent, while Ugwuka continued to accuse him, and also continued to deny that he himself did not have any hand in the death.

They have to take them to a popular shrine at Nando last Sunday, to swear before the deity, to prove their innocence. “After his nephew had sworn and was vindicated, Ugwuka was hooked and instantly blinded by the deity while swearing, which made him to start confessing immediately. “It was during the confession that he revealed that he killed his elder with rat poison because of land dispute.” A viral video showed Ugwuka kneeling and confessing at the shrine, while being interrogated by the villagers. Police spokesperson, Tochukwu Ikenga, did not pick his calls nor responded to text messages as at press time.
