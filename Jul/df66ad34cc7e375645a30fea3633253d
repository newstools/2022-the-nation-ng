Inspector General of Police (IGP), Usman Baba, has ordered the investigation of controversial musician, Portable over his claim of founding a notorious group, One Million Boys. Force Public Relations Officer, Prince Olumuyiwa Adejobi disclosed this on Twitter. Portable had in a now-deleted video boasted of being the brain behind dreaded groups, Ajah boys and One million boys.

Adejobi noted the IGP directed Lagos Commissioner of Police, Abiodun Alabi to investigate the matter. He tweeted: “Sequel to the trending video of one Habeeb Okikiola aka Portable where he claimed to have formed the One-Million Boys cult group terrorising some parts of Lagos State, the IGP has ordered CP Lagos to investigate the indicting statement and take necessary legal action. “This directive is premised on the continuous effort of the Nigeria Police Force to fish out pillars and sponsors of cult groups in order to decimate their activities and restore sanity to our society.”
