Dutch giants Ajax Amsterdam yesterday announced the signing of Super Eagles defender Calvin Bassey from Scottish Cup champions Glasgow Rangers. The Dutch giants confirmed that the Nigerian international had inked a five-year contract that will keep him in Amsterdam until 2027. Rangers will smile to the bank with 23 million euros, the transfer fee Ajax paid for Bassey. That amount could rise to 26.5 million euros when add-ons are factored in. Bassey thus became the most expensive sale in Rangers’ history, eclipsing the €14 million Everton paid for youngster Nathan Patterson last year. The deal will also go down as the second highest fee ever paid by Ajax for a signing, coming some way short of Steven Bergwijn’s €31.25m move from Tottenham Hotspur earlier this month. Scottish giants Rangers have also confirmed the deal. A club statement reads: “Rangers Football Club can today confirm Calvin Bassey has joined Ajax in a deal which is the largest in Rangers’ history.   ‘Kerosene price rose by 12.09% in June’     Dockworkers shut terminals     Super Falcons boycott training over unpaid allowances   “Calvin leaves with best wishes from everyone at Rangers and we thank him for his hard work and commitment over the past two seasons. “The 22-year-old joined Rangers from Leicester City for a Training Compensation Fee in the summer of 2020, making 65 appearances for the Light Blues. “Bassey played his part in Rangers’ historic 55th league title victory, won the 2022 Scottish Cup, while also having a huge role in the incredible UEFA Europa League run to the final in Seville last season. “We wish Calvin all the best for his future career.” Following the earlier departure of Joe Aribo and Leon Balogun, Bassey is the third Super Eagles star to exit the Ibrox Stadium this summer. The 22-year-old has landed in Austria where he will join Ajax’s first team training camp.
