Amstel Malta Ultra, the official malt drink of the Super Falcons has hailed the brave display by the Nigeria women’s team in their semi-final clash against the Atlas Lionesses of Morocco at the ongoing Women’s Africa Cup of Nations. The nourishing malt drink which is the foremost  sponsors of women’s football in Nigeria, said missing the final ticket hurts but  Nigerians and indeed global football fans were happy with the Super Falcons’ never-say-die attitude on Monday night in Rabat despite losing  via the lottery of penalty kicks. Despite being reduced to nine players in the 71st  minute following the debatable red card to Rasheedat Ajibade after  Halimat Ayinde already sent off earlier, the Super Falcons showed the true Nigerian spirit as they held the hosts for the remainder of the second half and all through the extra time before the ensuing penalty kicks.

She said: “The Super Falcons have shown that they are worthy ambassadors and they deserve to be celebrated even though they did not make it to the final like we all wished and prayed for. “However, beyond that, the team has shown they have great potentials that they can unlock at the World Cup if the momentum is properly built upon.” Having missed out on the title, the Super Falcons will try to ensure they get the bronze medals when they take on the Copper Queens of Zambia in Casablanca on Friday.
