Convener of the Civil Society Committee For Anti-Fraud Election Security (CISCAES) Comrade Kennedy Iyere has urged the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to conduct a transparent, fair and credible governorship poll in Osun on Saturday. CISCAES, operating as a frontline electoral anti-fraud civil society organisation, also warned INEC to allow a repeat of the alleged vote-buying in the recent Ekiti gov poll.   Why Lagosians should support Sanwo-Olu for second term     ‘Muslim-Muslim ticket won’t pose problem’     Osun: APC, PDP in last-minute scramble for votes   Iyere, in a statement, stressed the need to ensure the BVAS technology does not act in a fraudulent or manipulated way which could result in vote-rigging as well as conspiracy capable of jeopardising the success of the election. According to him: ‘INEC should not favour the power that be as it is already being largely speculated. Any attempt to rig the Osun 2022 Gov poll might provoke an anti-INEC protest, which would compel aggrieved Nigerians to unconditionally demand the immediate sack of Mahmoud Yakaubu, as National Chairman of INEC,” he said.
