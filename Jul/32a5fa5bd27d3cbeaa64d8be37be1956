Former Super Falcons coach Thomas Dennerby is optimistic the team can still win the 2022 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations despite falling to the Bayana Bayana of South Africa in the opening group C fixture. The 60-year-old, who led Sweden to finish third at the 2011 Women’s World Cup in Germany, won the 2018 African Women’s Cup of Nations in Ghana and later steered the nation to the Women’s World Cup knockout stage for the first time in 20 years in France 2019. The Randy Waldrum led side started the defense of their Women’s Africa Cup of Nations (WAFCON) crown in defeat. Two goals in just two minutes from Jermaine Seoposenwe and Hildah Magaia gave the Banyana Banyana a nice cushion.

Incidentally, as defending champions the Super Falcons also lost their opening match at the 11th Women’s Africa Cup of Nations in Ghana in 2018 to the same South Africans but would later exert revenge by beating them via penalties to win the title. “Definitely, I believe very much in the team, ” the Swede, who is currently the coach of India’s women team, said, “I think they have a very good chance to handle things. The Super Falcons have a really good chance to lift the trophy once again and I really hope with all my heart they will win it. Best of luck to everyone.”
