This also complements the unprecedented infrastructural development we have seen in the health sector. We have several modern equipments recently procured by the government. “Hiring new hands to deploy these machines for the good of the masses completes the governor’s efforts to significantly turn around the fortune of this important sector in line with his campaign mantra. We are so grateful. “The doctors include dentists to strengthen the new dental centre, while the eight consultants include two anaesthetists to man the new Intensive Care Unit (ICU), even as government trains more perioperative/theatre nurses for the facility.”
