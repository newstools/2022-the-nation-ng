Paul Pogba has shared a video from on board a private jet to tease his imminent return to Juventus. The midfielder left Manchester United for the second time at the end of his contract and is set to sign for the Bianconeri – also for a second time – on a free transfer after the Italian giants saw off competition from the likes of Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain. 90min revealed on Tuesday that Pogba was now on the verge of a move back to Turin having agreed on a four-year contract at Allianz Stadium back in June, with the 29-year-old set to undergo a medical this week. The player himself has now all but confirmed that an announcement is incoming. Taking to social media, Pogba posted a video of himself sitting on a private jet, looking pretty happy.   Sallah: Remain steadfast in prayers for peace – Gombe…     Eid-El-Kabir: Only peace, oneness can ensure stability of…     Eid-el-Kabir: APC chieftain urges Nigerians to reflect on…   “It’s time…it’s time…yes sir!” he says, before adding in Italian: “See you soon.” Pogba had been holidaying in Miami so it’s unclear when he will touch down in Italy, but evidently his return is imminent. Although an official agreement has been delayed due to commercial details such as image rights being ironed out, the France international is finally on the cusp of rejoining Juve on a contract that will run until 2026. The midfielder’s family love the city of Turin and he was enticed by Juventus’ desire to build a competitive team around him and the opportunity to work with former boss Max Allegri once again. Pogba ultimately decided against penning fresh terms at Man Utd following what was a tumultuous six years back at the club he signed for from Juve for £89m in 2016.
