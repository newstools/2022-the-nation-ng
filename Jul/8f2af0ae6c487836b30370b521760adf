A gas well-head blowout happened yesterday in Sangana community, Brass Local Government Area of Bayelsa State, from an adriatic rig owned by Conoil Producing Limited, it has been learnt. The leak reportedly happened after a major gas leak on November 1, 2021, leaving residents with series of health challenges. The Chairman of Sangana Fishing Union (SFU), Noel Ikonikumo, said gas was spewing out from the rig and spreading fast into the sea and the community. He said: “The gas is spewing out now as we speak. It is more serious than that of last year as it is now getting to the point of the rig burning. “The leak is still from the same rig. They even brought another one to join that one. There are two rigs there now by the same company. It happened Wednesday evening and it is worse than even the other one that happened about eight months ago.

The oil firm has started evacuating its workers there.” It was gathered that last Saturday, a supply vessel fell and discharged its content into the ocean. The chemical was said to have spread from the sea shore. Another indigene, Ayibatonye Benjamin, urged the relevant authorities to intervene to avoid the incident from escalating. “Another blowout has happened at the same rig. The company has started evacuating its workers. Efforts should be intensified to contain it before it begins to catch fire,” he said. Efforts to get the spokesperson of Conoil, Richard Edegbai, were unsuccessful as his numbers were not reachable.
