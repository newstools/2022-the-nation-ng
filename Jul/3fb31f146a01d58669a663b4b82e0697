Entertainment consultant Joice Ize-Iyamu has said that the history of Nigeria’s Afrobeats will not be complete without the contribution of the females that worked the genre from its roots. Ize-Iyamu, in a recent Instagram post, says the Afrobeats success story is incomplete without giving accolades to the less than five percent of ladies who worked tirelessly when the industry was in its foundation stage. “I contributed to the Nigerian Music scene by showing women that it was possible to dream and work hard in the industry irrespective of who or what you are. My sisters and I deserve our accolades irrespective of who is speaking. Speak the truth. We were less than 5% women in the entire music industry at that time. We had nothing but our passion for the movement and we used whatever platform we had to push the industry forward. Shoutout to my Sistas. Our works will never be erased,” she said.

She reminisced on the struggle from 1999 till 2022 saying, “Started this journey in 1999, with no financial backing, no label, just my passion and strong belief in the music, the craft, and the artist. With family and friends turning their backs on me and acting like I was a disgrace knowing at that time the industry was just at its foundation.” Iyamu has worked with the likes of 2baba, Darey, Weird Mc, Mtrill, and Now Music amongst other entertainment outfits and practitioners.
