The quality Joe Aribo as displayed since he joined Southampton from Glasgow Rangers in a deal worth €7.1 million earlier this month has left some of his Saints teammates in awe. Since signing two weeks ago, the Nigeria international has wasted no time in integrating Southampton boss Ralph Hasenhuttl’s  setup. The German has featured Aribo in all their preseason games since he arrived. And that is an indication that Aribo could play an important role for the Saints when the Hampshire side begin their Premier League campaign with a game against Tottenham on August 6. The Super Eagles midfielder played his first minutes in a 3-1 loss to RB Leipzig twelve days ago. Aribo has since featured in three more games for the Saints. On Wednesday, Aribo came off the bench to help Southampton to an outstanding 3-1 comeback victory over Monaco.

After he was brought on, Southampton scored two more goals to ensure a 3-1 scoreline. Saints midfielder Stuart Armstrong is one of his teammates that revealed that he is impressed with the quality of the Super Eagles midfielder. The Scotland international who  scored one of the goals for the Saints, admitted  that the quality Aribo brings to the team is undeniable. “I didn’t want to speak to him as soon as he came in,” Armstrong told Southampton TV as per the Scottish Sun. “I thought I’d let him lie for a week, and then you can see in training the quality he has. “He’s very powerful, strong, technical, keeps the ball tight, very composed with his movement and his passing. “So yeah, (he is) a very good addition, experienced and we are very happy with him.”
