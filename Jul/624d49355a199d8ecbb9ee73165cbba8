Delegates from Medela Cares’ in Switzerland are on a three-day  assessment and evaluation visit to Neo-natal Intensive Care Units (NCIU) of hospitals in Abuja, Kwara, and Lagos states, participating in its Lactation Care and Feeding Programme. The programme is in conjunction with its partner, Wellbeing Foundation Africa (WBFA), a body which aims to improve health outcomes for women, infants and children. Founder and President of WBFA and WHO Foundation Ambassador for Global Health Mrs. Toyin Saraki said the team’s visit was in line with WBFA’s commitment to reducen mortality rate of neonates in NICU in accordance with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 3.2), ‘which focused on ending preventable deaths of newborns and children under five years of age’. She noted that ensuring new mothers are wholly supported to breastfeed is not only critical for the health and wellbeing of the baby, but also linked to 17 of the United Nations (UN) SDGs.
