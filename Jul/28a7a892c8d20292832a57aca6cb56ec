You just evolve, you want different things for yourself, just like I did some couple of movies, I think two movies in the past year, one last year and one this year, I mean not to say I can’t do things like that but to be active in the industry like I used to is not a possibility, it won’t let me be a mum and I can’t jeopardize and I can’t compromise that for anything in the world”, she said, On how she would be able to combine politics and being a mum, she stated that it is a known fact for women to be skilled with the act of multi-tasking adding that she runs five companies and does not have a nanny. In her words “I have so much on my plate already and I know I would do fine.”
