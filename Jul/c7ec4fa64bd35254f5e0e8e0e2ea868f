Afrobeats superstar, Davido has left fans, especially a particular female fan reeling in ecstasy as he gifts her personal effect plus money. The DMW boss who took a break from his US tour was at Infinix VIP concert in Lagos on Sunday night where he thrilled his fans with an amazing performance. While performing, he brought an unidentified female fan on stage and she excitedly joined him in performing his latest single, “Stand Strong.”   I’m Afrofusion singer, not Afrobeats, Burna Boy…     Fans console Rita Dominic over ‘limited’ height     I’d have five baby mamas if I were male artiste – Tiwa…   Seeing her beautiful show, Davido said: “Make some noise for this beautiful lady…”, proceeded to pull off his shoes and gave them to her. Upon receiving the designer shoes, the completely hysteric lady jumped around the stage, laid down and then hugged Davido. As she was about to leave the stage, the singer called her back and instructed his lawyer, Bobo Ajudua, to give her N2 million. “Wait! Wait!! Wait!!! Bobo, give her two million naira”, said Davido.
