On-air-personality, Damilola Banire, has urged Nigerian celebrities to ignore troublesome fans who may want to taint their public image. In an interview, Banire said celebrities should remain calm in tense situations because some fans want unnecessary attention. She said: “It is not worth it. However, sometimes fans could be overbearing and we have also seen situations where fans fight celebs or bully you just to get your attention but in all, silence is golden.   Depression notifies me when to switch my style – Rema     I’m inspired by Burna Boy’s tenancity – Blaqbonez     Yul Edochie calls out Ahmed Musa over post   On whether a celebrity’s image is tainted when he loses his head, she said: “Depending on what the person is losing it for or about, Eg, if you are flaring up to protect your right and sanity it will only take a while such matters will fade, but if in situations like infidelity, fake life or some other misconduct; yes they might get tainted, but overall I think in whatever situation, who loves you as a fan might not be deterred if you lose your head or not, the love is intact.” Banire advised celebrities to be diplomatic in handling overbearing fans. This is coming after actor Taiwo Hassan aka Ogogo engaged in a brawl with a fan last week. According to Hassan, the said fan alongside others had approached him and demanded he pays them a sum he could not afford. Despite giving them all the money he had, the said fan then proceeded to drag him with his attire and this got him angry and a brawl ensued.
