A House of Representatives candidate of All Progressives Congress (APC) in Adamawa State Hon Vrati Nzonzo has vowed support for the party and its presidential candidate, Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu, despite the outcries on some quarters over the choice of Senator Kashim Shettima as his running mate. Nzonzo, who has the APC ticket for the Numan/Demsa/Lamurde Federal constituency for the 2023 elections, said at the weekend that though APC’s Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket makes his candidacy difficult to sell to his people, he will push not only his ticket but that of the presidency come 2023. Vrati told newsmen in Yola: “It will affect us, we APC candidates in Christian dominated areas. There is no doubt about it but we are hoping to be able to make our people understand that we differ if the position of the party suggests that Christians don’t matter.   Osun poll: Day Ede stood still for Adeleke     Why Enugu should vote Mbah, by Nwodo     Abiru: We need to replace outdated laws   “It’s a trying time for me but I have no option. I am an APC candidate. I am an APC person and I will support APC. I will support Tinubu.” Explaining how the APC Muslim-Muslim ticket poses a challenge to candidates like him, Vrati, a former chairman of Lamurde local government Council, said: “I am from a Christian dominated constituency: Numan/Demsa/Lamurde. Are you now telling people not to vote for me since my party does not recognise my faith or refuse to be fair to my faith? “If you are telling people from Christian-dominated parts of the North where many of us come from and are seeking votes in 2023 that the presidency can be won without Christians, its not fair. Even if you actually win, you would have passed a rancorous message.” He added that its APC family as a whole that will attain victory, not a particular person, explaining, “It is fallacy to think that it’s Shettima that will make the Northeast vote APC. If all of us in the region who are APC work for APC, we will win.”
