The brand influencer said she suffered depression but chose to stay happy because of the overwhelming love from family and fans. According to her: “I saw a few comments, some people say that May is using this to cash out. I am like, okay, it is fine. I am cashing out, right? I don’t wish this upon my enemy if at all I have any. I do not think I have enemies. Depression is real and there are different stages of depression. For me, rather than dwell in depression, I chose to, I decided to pick up the pieces of a beautiful world that I had. “A very beautiful world, an amazing world that suddenly shattered, that suddenly crashed. I decided to pick up the pieces and decided to move on rather than dwell in depression. It has not been easy. I am glad that I look happy and I appear strong. I am glad that I am happy and able to go out.   “I am even surprised and amazed at some of the things I do but it is all because of the love. It is the support from my family and you guys. You have all been amazing and the love is massive. These are the things that have kept me going. Some people say that I inspire and motivate them but the truth is that you guys are the ones that inspire me.”
