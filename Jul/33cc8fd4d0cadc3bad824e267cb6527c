African and  Commonwealth Champions Tobi Amusan became the first Nigerian athlete to win a World Athletics Championship gold after she set a new World record in the Women’s 100m Hurdles at the World Championship in Oregon, USA. She finished the race in 12.12s beating her own record in the semi finals as she had earlier smashed  the world record with her 12.40s run. In the final,  she edged Jamaica’s Britany Anderson who  took silver in 12.23sec, while Olympic champion Jasmine Camacho-Quinn of Puerto Rico claimed bronze in 12.23. “Honestly, I believe in my abilities but I was not expecting a world record at these championships,” Amusan who shed tears of joy during the medal presentation, said after her final victory.

So the world record is a bonus. I knew I had it in me but I could not believe it when I saw it on the screen after the semis. “Before the final, I just tried to stay calm and to do my best. I took a deep breath knowing that I have some goal to accomplish and it worked pretty good. I knew it was very fast but not this fast.” She became the  first Nigerian athlete  to set a World Record in any international event. Meanwhile, Ese Brume also won a silver medal in  the long jump silver.
