Actress-turned-evangelist Eucharia Anunobi has described proponents of ‘no sex before marriage’ as wicked eunuchs and frigid females with dead libido. The preacher queried the proponents and the ‘wicked’ principle, insisting the only way to know about a proposed partner’s sexual prowess to engage in coitus before tying the knot. In a TikTok video shared via the ‘ordained preacher’s’ Instagram page, she said: “What’s this whole noise about no sex before marriage? How can anyone say someone should not indulge in sexual activity with someone who has already proposed? I mean, I don’t understand. “The proponents of this whole wicked agenda of ‘no sex before marriage’ must be completely out of their minds.

Okay let me ask this question….”How do I get to know if my tended is good in bed? “I think I know the answer to the wickedness that lies in the hearts of these proponents of this wicked principle. They’re castrated eunuchs and frigid females. “If not, how can they want to impose their dry lives on others. I think their libido is dead. Their sex drives have gone down to zero. That’s why they say we that are hot-blooded should be like them but we can’t be like them. How can we be like them? “How can we not have sex with someone that I’m completely attracted to; someone that has already proposed to marry me or that I’ve proposed to? And someone said I should not get to know him or her. Something is wrong with these people. They’re not of this world. “Because if they’re of this world, they’ll understand that it’s not easy to stay and be looking at someone you’re attracted to and not go under the sheets.”
