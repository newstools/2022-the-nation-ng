Chipper Cash, an African cross-border payments company has partnered with a local non-profit organisation, Executives Initiative, to chip away at illiteracy through football. The initiative targeted the organization of a beach football tournament in the Tarkwa Bay Community in Lagos with over 150 primary and secondary school children winning ‘back to school’ essentials and scholarships.

In 2020, thousands of the community’s residents were displaced with no alternatives for support. “In a community where people lack the basic amenities such as electricity and potable water supply, with such a huge gap in life’s basic necessities, it would be unimaginable the effects of the eviction on the children born out of and raised by this community.” Dare Asobele, Founder, Executives Initiative commented; ‘We’re excited to partner with Chipper Cash to put a smile on the faces of these young stars and we hope to create a chain reaction of love that will promote collaboration and philanthropy.”
