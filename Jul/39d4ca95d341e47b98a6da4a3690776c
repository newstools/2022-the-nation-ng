Robert Lewandowski has joined his new Barcelona team-mates in Miami after completing his £42.5m (€50m) from Bayern Munich. Barca agreed a deal to sign the striker, who is understood to have signed a three-year contract with the club with an option for a further 12 months, over the weekend. Although there has been no official written confirmation, Lewandowski wore Barcelona colours in a series of videos posted on the club’s Twitter account from Miami.”Finally I am here and I am very happy to join Barcelona,” he said in a video released by Barcelona ahead of its US tour.
