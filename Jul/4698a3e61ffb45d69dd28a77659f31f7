Our enviable chaos Our fantastically corrupt propensity Our globally certified incompetence Our preference for fast and easy wealth   Our act-first-think-later ‘philosophy’ Our leave-it-to-God religiosity Our world-famous disdain for Science Our unbreakable bond with ignorance   Our rabid aversion to Reason Our impatience with the through and thorough Our seed-eater’s improvidence Our headless covenant with the here-and-now     SNAPSONG 161     SNAPSONG 162     SNAPSONG 161   Fifteen million Nigerian children out of school The straight and sure way From babyhood to bandithood And the trail of tears that drown the nation   Failing factories, booming churches The jobless join the hopeless Miracle crowds on tenuous hopes Predatory pastors and their phantom faiths   Happy through them all Our eyes glow in the dark Dancing and shouting in garish garments We the owambe crowd of a happy nation
