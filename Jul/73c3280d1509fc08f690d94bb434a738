Osun: fear grips PDP camp     Anxiety as INEC closes nomination for presidential, NASS…     Yakubu to INEC staff: Be above board   He said, “since we adopted him as the candidate of our party, he has travelled out without any clear communication with us. We later heard that he has been communicating with political parties to trade PRP. We set up a committee and got to know his dishonest moves. We informed our national secretariat and our withdrawal was announced. We are not participating in tomorrow’s exercise.” However, Busuyi debunked the allegations, saying, “I funded the party after my emergence as the governorship candidate, I pay the party N1.4 million every month for five months. They are expecting more money from me and I am not ready to give them. That is why they are going about to blackmail me. They are tax collectors who want money all the time. “I have filed my petition against them, I will submit after Saturday’s exercise. I am fully in the race of Osun governorship poll.”
