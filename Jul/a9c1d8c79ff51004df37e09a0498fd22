Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) had fixed Saturday, August 6, 2022, for its mop-up Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) for candidates who could not participate in the examinations during the period of the exercise for some verified reasons. The board said it took the decision to give equal opportunity to all candidates who desire to acquire tertiary education. JAMB said this in its weekly bulletin released by its Head of Media and Information, Dr. Fabian Benjamin, yesterday in Abuja.

The reviews are done by a team of experts with a view to detecting activities subversive of the examination process. “It’s after all the reports have been collated and considered that the management would take critical decisions as to the necessity or otherwise of a mop-up examination for affected candidates. “So, after a thorough analysis of the conduct of the 2022 UTME in 10 centres spread across five states of the federation where examination malpractice was established to have taken place, it became necessary to cancel the results of all the candidates who sat the examination in the affected 10 centres.”
