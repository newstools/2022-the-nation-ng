Police in Osun State have launched a manhunt for a woman, who was said to have set her husband ablaze. The suspect, Ifeoluwa Akanji, reportedly set her spouse, Bolu Bamidele, on fire over alleged infidelity. The Nation learnt that Bamidele and Ifeoluwa had a marriage engagement in March before he travelled to Cairo, Egypt, where he is based. Bamidele built a bungalow for Ifeoluwa in Osogbo and bought her a car, a source said, adding that when Bamidele returned to Nigeria to celebrate Ifeoluwa’s birthday last week, Ife discovered while going through his phone that he impregnated another woman.   ‘Kerosene price rose by 12.09% in June’     Dockworkers shut terminals     CAF AWARDS 2022: Oshoala may pick record fifth African …   “Bolu and Ifeoluwa had been on the issue for about a week before he set the private house on fire while Bolu was inside the house, locking all entrances on Sunday and fled to an unknown destination,” the source said. It took about 40 minutes for neighbours to evacuate Bamidele from the burning house, it was said. Gabriel Adejare said, “We were pouring sand and water and trying to break into the house through the window to rescue Bamidele. “We broke about four windows before we could get into the house. We were able to rescue Bamidele after about 40 minutes when he was in the fire. “We found him beside a burnt bed and we rushed him to a nearby hospital and he was referred to Osun State University Teaching Hospital, Osogbo and later referred to Ibadan for treatment.” It was gathered that Bamidele will be buried by the family members this week as police through the spokesperson, Yemisi Opalola, confirmed that a manhunt has been launched for the fleeing wife.
