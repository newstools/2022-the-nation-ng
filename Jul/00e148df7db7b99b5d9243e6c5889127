Actor Yomi Fabiyi and mother of his last child, Grace Jimoh, have engaged in a social media feud over allegations bordering on sex-for-roles. The dispute followed screenshots posted by the actor showing his first conversation with Grace on his Instagram page. The actor said his action was in response to some blogs’ allegations that he asked Grace to sleep with him to help her acting career. Fabiyi wrote: “This was how it started with Grace and I. Is this SEX FOR ROLE? Only a criminal or reckless journalist will not balance story before reaching a conclusion. You created a platform, violate people’s rights, gained traffic with people’s life, health, career.” In response, Grace posted on her Instagram story that Fabiyi had deleted portions of his conversation with her. Grace also claimed that the actor showed his genitals during their first video call and criticised him for “holding phony evidences” of their interactions.

When I sent the pictures, what was your response?” “The first time we did video call, what were you showing me? Someone you don’t even know, all you could do was to start bringing out your prick. I immediately ended the call,” Grace alleged. She said, however, that even though she had her own proof, she would stop responding to Fabiyi for the benefit of their child. “Replying you is just a waste of time. There are many evidences. Even the prick you showed on the first video call, even before our chats, but you know what? I won’t reply you. “Not because I am all at fault, but because of this child. He never forced me to birth him. Shalom.” Korede, the couple’s first child, was born in February 2022.
