Super Eagles defender Calvin Bassey has revealed that he joined Dutch champions Ajax because of their great structure and rich history. Bassey impressed for Scottish giants Glasgow Rangers last season. But it was his incredible performance in the finals of the Europa League against Eintracht Frankfurt that made Europe take notice. Chelsea, Bayern Munich, West Ham, and other top European teams were linked with the versatile 22-year-old. However, it was 36-time Dutch champions Ajax that succeeded in securing Bassey’s services from Rangers for €23 million in a five-year deal.

They play in the Champions League and they win trophies. They have got a history. The players who have come in and out of this club who have gone on to be amazing players and careers at Ajax or elsewhere just show that something is right here. “It just made perfect sense for me. When I got the call, you didn’t have to ask me twice. It was a definite yes. No doubt. It’s a nice feeling having such a great club interested in you. Even just the interest, but for them to follow through and for me to be here, I can’t put into words really.” With his move, Bassey becomes the seventh Nigerian to join Ajax. The club is unarguably the most successful football club in the Netherlands. They have one Champions League title, 20 Dutch Cup titles, and 36 Eredivisie cups. The 22-year-old would look to bring joy to his new team just like retired Nigerian stars like Finidi George, Kanu Nwankwo, and Tijani Babangida.
