Manchester United’s hopes of signing Barcelona and Netherlands midfielder Frenkie de Jong have been dented by news he “wants to stay” at Camp Nou next season. De Jong, 25, is Man Utd’s number one transfer target this summer as Erik ten Hag looks to be reunited with his former Ajax student. Ten Hag has personally asked for De Jong’s signing and the Red Devils have been working on a deal for weeks. The player hasn’t stated a desire to leave Barcelona, but Man Utd have been confident of convincing him to leave Spain for Old Trafford. With Barcelona struck by financial issues, it’s understood they may need to offload saleable assets this summer, and De Jong has reportedly been seen as one such player.
