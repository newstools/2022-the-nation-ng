Former 100m Hurdles  World Champion Jamaican Danielle  Williams has described  Tobi Amusan World Record  and Gold  medal  at the 2022 World Athletics Championship in Oregon (USA) as amazing, adding victory  for the Nigerian after near past misses showed her stellar  stuff. Williams  who clocked 12:44 secs came a distant sixth as Amusan  ran the race of her life  finishing with an incredible 12: 06 secs to finish in pole position in the final on Sunday. Amusan had obliterated the world record in an astonishing semi-final where she clocked 12.12sec but her  winning 12.06sec is not  recognised as a world record due to a strong wind  following win of 2.5 metres per second.
