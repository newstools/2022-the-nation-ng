GRAMMY award-winning music star Burna Boy has opened up on how he perceives life after turning 30 in an album note after the release of his latest album, Love Damini. In the note, which was made available to Apple Music, the African Giant breaks down his new album as well as his perception of life since his 2021 birthday. He said, “After turning 30, birthdays seem to make you reflect on your life choices, or a lack thereof – your goals, dreams, hopes, achievements, and fears.”   NCC reads riot act to copyright infringers     Keppy Ekpeyong, Peace Anyiam-Osigwe, Achor Yusuf lead AMA’s…     Ogundoro’s FoodBay TV announces plan for Streetz Food Season…   The energetic performer, who admits to drawing inspiration from several African musical acts, also paid tribute to Indian-born Punjab music star Sidhu Moose Wala for helping him to open his mind more. “Even though it put me in a vulnerable place, it also challenged me to do and feel more. I started working on a Punjab mixtape with the late great Sidhu Moose Wala, halfway through recording this project, because I needed to open my mind more. I’m eternally grateful to him for that, and so, on this album, I thought about a few things,” he said. According to the 31-year-old singer and songwriter, his hit singles, ‘Last Last,’ ‘Science,’ and ‘For my hand,’ which features UK star Ed Sheeran, from his recent album, were inspired by the realisation that relations and relationships are fragile. “Relations and relationships are fragile; compartmentalising the different shades of grey around this concept in “For My Hand”, “Science” and “Last Last”. Hopefully this translates to you all,” he noted.
