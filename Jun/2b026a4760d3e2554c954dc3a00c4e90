Super Falcons’ captain Onome Ebi has expressed optimism that the nine-time African champions are fully focused on the twin objectives of winning a ticket to the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup finals and retaining their Women Africa Cup of Nations title in Morocco next month. Cup holders Nigeria and 11 other countries will contend for the coveted Women AFCON trophy in the North African nation from July 2 to 23, and all four semi-finalists are guaranteed spots in the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup – the biggest ever in the history of the women’s game that will be staged in Australia and New Zealand a year on.

We have no illusions. Women’s football has continued to grow in a lot of other African nations, faster than anyone can imagine. So, there will be nothing like under-rating any team. All the teams will be upbeat about their chances and winning tickets to the World Cup. “On our part, as defending champions, we know our strengths. We know what we have to bring to the pitch to conquer. The wise thing always is to take it one match at a time. We go up first against the Banyana, and then we have to face the challenges of Botswana and Burundi. Then, the knock-out rounds. World Cup ticket is paramount, but we also want to retain our trophy,” she added.
