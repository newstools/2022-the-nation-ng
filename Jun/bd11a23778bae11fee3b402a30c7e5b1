Following allegations of anomalies during the legislative primary election of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), in Osun State, the Appeal Panel has ordered the cancellation and rerun of the primary for the House of Representatives in Iwo/Olaoluwa/Ayedire Federal Constituency. A report of the panel signed by its Chairman, Secretary and a member of the committee, Bar Abdulfatai Adesina, Dr Edward Adie and Hon Yemisi Afolabi respectively, hinged the recommendation on the petition by an aspirant, Lukman Bello. Bello complained of the replacement of authentic delegates with impostors, and he was able to prove the manipulation of the delegates’ list.

This means that he protested on the day of the election,” the report added. The committee, however, recommended that the Iwo/Olaoluwa/Ayedire Federal Constituency for the House of Representatives should be cancelled and a re-run conducted as deemed fit by the National Working Committee, noting that the NWC has the final say on any election.
