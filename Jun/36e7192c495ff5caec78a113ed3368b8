The Governor noted: “There is no provision on the ballot paper for the Vice President. Therefore, Ohanaeze Ndigbo was never in context of the position of Vice President. The Vice President is a position that is always nominated or chosen by the presidential candidate in consultation with the political party and some critical stakeholders of the party.” Those who joined Uzodimma’s numerous supporters from the 27 local government areas of Imo State to receive him at the Airport include Deputy Governor Prof. Placid Njoku; Imo Speaker Kennedy Ibe; Deputy Speaker Amara Iwuanyanwu and other principal officers of the Assembly. Others were the Secretary to the Government of Imo State Chief Cosmas Iwu; Chief of Staff, Barr Nnamdi Anyaehie and members of the State Expanded Executive Council.
