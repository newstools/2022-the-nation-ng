A former Minister of State for Education and governorship aspirant in Delta State, Olorogun Kenneth Gbagi, has defected from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the Social Democratic Party (SDP). He has won the state’s governorship ticket of the SDP ahead of the 2023 general election. Gbagi’s victory is coming on the heels of his withdrawal from governorship primaries of the PDP, which held last week in Asaba, the state capital. The former minister dumped the PDP after he fell out with Governor Ifeanyi Okowa over his alleged support for the party’s governorship candidate and House of Assembly Speaker Sheriff Oborevwori.
