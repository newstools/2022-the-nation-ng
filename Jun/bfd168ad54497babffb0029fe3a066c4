Rapper Emeka Akumefule aka Blaqbonez has made an ‘unusual’ request directed at his female fans. ‘Emeka The Stallion’ requested ladies interested in throwing brassieres at him during his performance this weekend to reach him via DM. This may not be unconnected with Burna Boy’s experience during his energetic performance at the Madison Square Garden, US in April. The event saw several ladies remove undergarments and throw them at ‘Odogwu’ while performing. Blaqbonez may just seemingly desire to have a taste of the feel as such, he took to his Twitter handle to nicely request that interested ladies should send him a dm to that effect.

Thank you.” A tweep simply identified as @icekied then inquired if throwing boxers was to be expected. “Boxers nkor”, he tweeted. Responding, Blaqbonez said: “Na you go pay me.”
