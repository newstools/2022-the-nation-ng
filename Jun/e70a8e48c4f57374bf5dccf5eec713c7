As Nigeria joins the rest of the global community to mark this year’s World Drug Day, Christ Against Drug Abuse Ministry (CADAM), is putting together a series of activities to raise awareness against the scourge of drug and substance abuse. Significantly,  CADAM, a faith-based Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) under the auspices of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) is doubling its efforts  in the fight against the menace in Nigeria. In a statement, the faith – based group said it had over 30 years worked closely with other stakeholders in the sector to treat and rehabilitate people with drug use disorders.   Obasanjo: I made mistake picking Atiku as vice president     Southeast killings not about Igbo agitation – Soludo     Buhari to Nigerians in Rwanda: I’m proud of youths…   It said over 3,000 people had been successfully treated for drug and substance disorders and are now living more fulfilled lives. World Drug Day is observed every year on June 26. The United Nations General Assembly in 1987 established and marked the day as the International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking to serve as a reminder of the goals agreed to by member states of creating an international society free of drug abuse.  CADAM said recent happenings in Nigeria served as a trigger to determine this year’s theme: ‘Addressing Drug Challenges in Health and Humanitarian Crisis’ #CareinCrisis.
