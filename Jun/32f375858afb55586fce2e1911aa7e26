Data management has been a major issue among Nigerians who have complained about subscribing for a month and finding out the data doesn’t last up to what they expected it to last. There are actually many ways to manage data which include switching off data when not in use. This is one important point in managing data. When you are not using your data, turn it off as this helps to manage the data. Switch it on only when you need to work with it. Always off auto update of apps: This is also an important way of managing your data, people leave their app updates on and when they subscribe the apps update automatically and this embezzles a lot of data.

For example when WhatsApp is being used, if it’s not removed from the multitasking screen, it continues to function and that way, the data is still active on the app. Avoid midnight data usage: People don’t actually know that when they use data in the night, it goes faster. This should be avoided. People should learn to do whatever they want to do during the day. Switch off auto plays on social media: This is also data consuming, auto plays should be turned off on social media platforms such as Facebook (Meta), Twitter, and YouTube. Restrict background data: Some apps use a lot of data even when the phone is not in use. Not every app needs to stay active all the time. Identify these apps and act accordingly.
