President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday forwarded the names of seven ministerial nominees to the Senate for screening and confirmation. Senate President Ahmad Lawan read the President’s letter on the floor of the Upper Chamber in Abuja. President Buhari said his request was in accordance with the provisions of Section 147, subsection 2 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, as amended. The nominees for confirmation include: Henry Ikechukwu Ikoh (Abia State), Umana Okon Umana (Akwa Ibom), Ekumankama Joseph Nkama (Ebonyi); and Goodluck Nnana Opiah (Imo). Others are: Umar Ibrahim El-Yakub (Kano), Ademola Adewole Adegoroye (Ondo) and Odum Odi (Rivers).

Some All Progressives Congress (APC) ministers had resigned their positions to contest primary elections in the party. They include the Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba; Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio; Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, Ogbonnaya Onu, and Minister for State for Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Tayo Alasoadura. While Nwajiuba, Akpabio, Onu and Amaechi lost their bids for the Presidency, Alasoadura failed to clinch a senatorial ticket in Ondo State.
