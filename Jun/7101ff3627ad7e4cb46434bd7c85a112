Entry submissions for the 2022 edition of the All African Music Awards (AFRIMA) will close on August 5, 2022. This was made known by the International Committee of the All African Music Awards (AFRIMA) in a recent statement. “The International Committee of the All African Music Awards (AFRIMA) is reminding all artists, music professionals, and other relevant stakeholders within Africa and across the diaspora to submit their entries for the 2022 AFRIMA edition, before the portal closes on August 5, 2022,” the statement reads in part.

We are a very thorough and transparent organisation, and we have a clear process for the award ceremony every year. Once the submission of entries ends, we spend time judging the materials, before we can derive our final nominations list. We also have a specific time allotted to voting. The entire process is also audited by a firm of international repute, PricewaterhouseCoopers. We do not just wake up and nominate people. AFRIMA 2022 will be held from November 3 – 6 this year. To achieve this, we cannot extend deadlines at this point.” According to AFRIMA, all prospective entries must have been created between August 20, 2021, and August 5, 2022, being the year in review for all submissions.
