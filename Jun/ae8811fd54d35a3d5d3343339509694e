Rising singer Hydro has explained why he is changing his stage name from Hydro to Hydroheelz with the release of a new single ‘Dey For You.’ The song, written in Port Harcourt pidgin, was produced by afro-pop musician Beatboss. Originally named Uchenna Agu, Hydro had recently recovered from a life-threatening health scare that interrupted his budding afro music career.

All those days and weeks I was in the hospital, I was just praying for God to heal me and help me recover. I missed the music, missed the studio sessions.” He explained as he reminisced on his ordeal saying “When I started out with my debut single ‘Tire’, it was well-received. My guys really liked that song. And so many people were just grooving to the beats. I posted some of them on my Instagram. “It encouraged me a lot sha. I have always known what I am carrying, but the performance of that first song really made me happy. And then I put out my second song ‘My Turn’, not too long ago. So when this sickness came, I was really scared. But thank God I recovered. I feel like a new, reloaded individual, ready to go even bigger than my dreams.”
