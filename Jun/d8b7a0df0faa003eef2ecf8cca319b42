Barcelona will up their offer to keep Gavi at the club as they look to end speculation about the midfielder’s Camp Nou future, sources have told ESPN. Barca will make “a big financial effort,” one club source said, to come to an agreement with Gavi’s agent, former midfielder Ivan de la Pena. They have drawn up a contract that will run until 2027 and include a €1 billion release clause. The two parties are looking for a date to sit down and close the issue once and for all. Sources on both sides of the talks are optimistic an extension will be agreed soon, with the player’s deal due to expire in summer 2023.

Luis Enrique denied it was intended for the Catalan club, though, saying he was “talking in general,” just days before Gavi became Spain’s youngest ever scorer, breaking Barca teammate Ansu Fati’s record. Talks to renew Gavi hit a stumbling block two weeks ago when Barca president Joan Laporta said he did not understand why De la Pena was considering other offers when he had a good proposal from the Blaugrana on the table.
