Sierra Leone’s striker Amadou Bakayoko believes the Leone Stars can stop the Super Eagles when both sides battle tomorrow in the 2023 AFCON qualifiers at the MKO Abiola Stadium in Abuja. He, however, warned the Eagles not t underrate them in the tie. The John Keister-captained side will be aiming to repeat their 4-4 draw feat against Nigeria in Benin. “Without a doubt playing against Nigeria will be my first proper match for Sierra Leone. Something I am looking forward to, but both Nigeria and Guinea-Bissau are no easy games,” Bakayoko told footballsieraleone.net.   Scoring against Chelsea remains evergreen, says Osimhen     AFCON 2023: NFF insists no fans for Nigeria, Sierra Leone…      Musa wants to carry on playing for Super Eagles   “God willing we can go out there and showcase ourselves against a tough Nigeria side. Helping Sierra Leone reach the Africa Cup of Nations in Ivory Coast 2023 will be massive, personally for me, my country, and all of us players working so hard to give our best. “Making the next African Cup of Nations is something as a player I want to be part of and will be unbelievable for me to play in the Ivory Coast (Cote d’Ivoire)  for the first time. “The last competition, I was not part of but I watched the team play well hence why it will be pivotal for us to be in the Ivory Coast tournament.” Bakayoko predicted that it would be difficult to defeat the Super Eagles, but he is optimistic that they will be able to pull off a historic victory this time around.
