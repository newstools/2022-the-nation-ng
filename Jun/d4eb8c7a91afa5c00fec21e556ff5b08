The Federal Government’s declaration that the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) terrorists were responsible for last Sunday’s killing of worshippers at St Francis Catholic Church, Owo, Ondo State has vindicated our earlier position, President, Ilana Omoo Oodua Worldwide, Prof Banji Akintoye said yesterday. The group said Yorubaland cannot be subjugated or conquered. It warned the invaders to leave their land or face the wrath of the people. In a statement by its Communication Manager Maxwell Adeleye, the Yoruba nation group said: “The declaration of the Federal Government that ISWAP was responsible for the Owo massacre is a vindication of our earlier position that Yorubaland has been encircled by foreign terrorists disguising as herdsmen.

All herdsmen operating in Ondo State should be profiled. Those in the bush must be flushed out. “The terrorists who were imported through the Northwest and transported to the South through trailers are obviously in our territory to subjugate us and take over our land but they are being warned now to leave or face the wrath of our people. Yoruba Land cannot be subjugated or conquered. “These invaders are particularly not happy that Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo-State has been intercepting them in Ondo-State while coming from the North. We urge Akeredolu not to be intimidated. History shall be kind to him. The Yoruba people shall triumph, “the statement added.
