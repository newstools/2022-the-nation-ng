Super Eagles’ Portuguese coach Jose Peseiro is eagerly looking forward to his second victory when the Eagles battle São Tomé and Príncipe today in the AFCON 2023 Qualifiers in Morocco. Goals from Alex Iwobi and Victor Osimhen earned the Eagles a 2-1 win over Leone Stars of Sierra Leone in the team’s first group match at the MKO Abiola Stadium last Thursday and the Eagles are aiming for another three points against ‘The Falcons and True Parrots’ at the Grand Stade Agadir, also known as Adrar Stadium, today. “We want to be the team at the top of the table, so we must fight hard against the opponents,”  Peseiro noted. “For every match, we must commit ourselves fully to winning it. “As I said earlier in the week, Nigeria have a huge pedigree and they also have both quality and quantity of players. It is important that we select the best all the time to win the big games,” the former Venezuela coach added.
