The president of Ohanaeze Lagos, Chief Solomon Aguene, has debunked rumour that the Igbo are under attack in Lagos State. According to him, the rumour is caused by a problem that arose from the collection of voters’ card in a part of the state. “There is nothing like that, the leader of all Igbo in the state has said.  What appeared to have caused the rumour is the problem arising from the collection of voters’ cards,” he said. Aguene appealed to Governor Babajide Sanwo -Olu to intervene in the matter so that the Igbos in Ojo, Ikotun and some other suburbs in Lagos can get their cards without stress at the various registration centers. He asserted that contrary to the claims on the social media, Igbo are not threatened in the state.

According to the Igbo leader, Governor Sanwo-Olu has demonstrated love and strong attachment to the Igbos living in Lagos, hence the huge support for his administration. He called on the Governor and the members of the public to disregard statements or information purportedly issued on behalf of Igbo people in Lagos from any individual or group which does not emanate from the office of the President of Ohanaeze Lagos.
