American teenager Coco Gauff reached her first Grand Slam singles final with victory in the French Open last four, setting up a tantalising meeting with world number one Iga Swiatek. Gauff, 18, won 6-3 6-1 against unseeded Italian Martina Trevisan on the Paris clay in her maiden major semi-final. Swiatek, 21, completed a serene journey into the Roland Garros final with a 6-2 6-1 win over 20th seed Daria Kasatkina. The Pole earned a 34th  successive win to move into her second major final. Swiatek, the 2020 Roland Garros champion, has dropped just one set this fortnight on the Paris clay.

Gauff won her maiden WTA singles title three months after Wimbledon and ended 2019 inside the top world’s 100.
