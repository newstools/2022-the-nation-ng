Arsenal are cooling their interest in Napoli and Nigeria striker Victor Osimhen. The centre-forward was a prime target for the club to fill the void left by the departures of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and soon Alexandre Lacazette. However, Corriere del Mezzogiorno suggests that Napoli asked for too high a fee for Osimhen.

While they are admirers of Osimhen, such a figure would eat up their entire summer budget. Arsenal were also linked to Gabriel Jesus, but the source suggests that transfer may not happen either. The Serie A giants reportedly want around €120 million for Osimhen, which is deemed excessive by those at Arsenal. The north Londoners may have been open to paying such high prices had they qualified for the Champions League, which would have guaranteed them extra funds.
