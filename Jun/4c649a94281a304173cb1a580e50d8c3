A political group, the Presidential Support Committee (PSC), has said Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu is the only person capable of sustaining the legacy of President Muhammadu Buhari. The group delivered the assessment at a briefing in Abuja by its National President Hon Gideon Sammani and National Publicity Secretary Dr Mohammad Kailani. Kailani said Tinubu, who garnered 1,271 votes from the delegates at the just concluded APC Presidential Primary Convention at the Eagle Square, thoroughly deserved his mandate and was very familiar with the party.   APC presidential primary, the most competitive, peaceful in…     140 suspected Yahoo Boys arrested in two Lagos hotels     NDLEA arrests 666 suspects for alleged drug trafficking in…   He also added by emerging as APC presidential candidate, Tinubu’s chances of winning the election next year are bright because he is somebody who has the interest of the people at heart. “In addition you will see from the landslide victory at the convention where he came out with 1271 votes. These are the votes of the delegates from the whole nation, including the North. If you look at the North, the whole north-west is for Asiwaju, Jigawa, Kano, Katsina, Sokoto, Kebbi, Kaduna and Bornu in the North-east. He deserves this mandate. One good turn deserves another. He is the only one that can carry out the legacies of Mr President and he knows this party,” Kailani said. He also commended the wisdom of the National Coordinator of the PSC Senator Godswill Akpabio for stepping down from the race and for being the first to publicly join forces with Tinubu to achieve his landmark electoral victory. Kailani urged the entire PSC members and indeed over 40 million registered members of the party to evolve internal mechanisms for mass mobilization of voters for the support of Tinubu in next year’s election.
