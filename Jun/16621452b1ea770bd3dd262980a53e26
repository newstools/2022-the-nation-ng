A weak mind wouldn’t be able to withstand the height of discouragement and discomfort while trying to get some attention. But with the doggedness and determination, I kept on my focus and didn’t renege.” He said with his recent release of ‘Good things’, he was able to express himself in those sonorous sounds such as ‘Allow me’, ‘Boost’, ‘Celebrate’, ‘Doings’. “It took a while to get those amazing songs together all because I wanted the best for my fans,” he said.
