A chieftain of All Progressives Congress (APC), Adesina Egbetokun, has urged Nigerians to vote for his party’s presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu in next year’s general elections to save the country from collapse. He said Asiwaju Tinubu is the best man for the job because he is better than the other candidates. He said: “God has ordained him to save Nigeria from the current state of economic decay and hopelessness.” Egbetokun contested the recent APC primary to represent Alimosho Federal Constituency at the National Assembly but later stepped down for the party’s choice, Ganiyu Adele Ayuba.

The APC chieftain said he has been looking for a credible and competent presidential candidate who could make a difference at the national level over the years. He said those that were elected to govern the country in the past performed below expectations and thereby disappointed Nigerians. He said he’s convinced that going by what Tinubu was able to achieve in Lagos State as governor, if he is allowed to become the next president of Nigeria, he would surely perform even better than what he did in Lagos. Egbetokun said Nigerians must not miss this great opportunity of having Tinubu as their next president.
