The Federal Government yesterday started the COVID-19 vaccination in community pharmacies to ramp up vaccination against the pandemic, especially at the community level of care. In partnership with the Association of Community Pharmacists of Nigeria (ACPN), the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) will engage over 6,000 pharmacies to ensure that the nation achieves its target of vaccinating 70 per cent of the population.
