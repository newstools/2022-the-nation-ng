Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag has warned his struggling stars there is no room for egomaniacs. The Dutchman plans to instil a Sir Alex Ferguson-style discipline at the club after a disastrous season tarnished by dressing room splits and training ground bust-ups. A source said: “The new gaffer sent the first-team players an email, telling them that football is a team game and no individual is more important than any other. “His emphasis is all on the team — despite United possessing world class stars. He wants the players to train at a higher intensity so that each session is like a game.

They will be drilled and drilled until they get it right. And if they can’t he’ll replace them with some of the promising youngsters.” The source added that Donny van de Beek, who worked with Ten Hag at Ajax prior to his £40m move to Old Trafford in 2020, has warned his teammates Ten Hag is a football obsessive who will back the players to the hilt, but if he thinks any of them are being disloyal, they will be out the door. Ten Hag also plans to look into the private lives of players so he can get to know how they spend their time off the pitch and what hobbies they have.   “He’s going to be a bit like Sir Alex Ferguson was,” the source said.“Fergie knew absolutely everything about his players and didn’t suffer any fools gladly. Neither will Ten Hag.”
