Ahead the 2023 general election, the Defence Headquarters (DHQ) has advised politicians to pursue their ambitions within the ambit of the law. It said politicians need to allow peace to reign across the country by moving away from actions and comments that can undermine national security as they engage in political campaigns. Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), General Lucky Irabor, gave the warning during the bi-weekly media briefing with Defence Correspondents yesterday in Abuja. He said: “Nigeria belongs to us. Now, we are going into a season and everyone of us is desiring that we have peaceful elections and electioneering campaigns. I am glad that Mr. President has told the nation what his desires are.

It is everyone of us that will ensure that we have a peaceful electioneering period so that we can have a country that we will all be proud of. If we don’t have a country, there will be no position to aspire for. “The most important thing regarding the elections that are coming is that we must be men and women who conduct ourselves peacefully. I need you to drive this message home to everyone, that for anyone who is looking forward to be elected, he must do it within the ambit of the provisions of the law. This is because we will not in any way stand aside and see those perpetrating violence all because they are looking for political or appointive offices.” Irabor added: “Nigeria remains a nation that must live in peace. So, we must not allow criminals or thugs that have made themselves available for anyone to use. We will not allow it.  “We are standing by the police to give them every support, because going forward, Nigeria must be peaceful.”
