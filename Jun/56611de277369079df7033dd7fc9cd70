The Chairman/Chief Executive Officer of the National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON), Alhaji Zikrullah Kunle Hassan, yesterday appealed to stakeholders in the aviation sector to ensure intending pilgrims enjoy hitch-free flights to Kingdom Saudi Arabia. Hassan said this during a visit to the Director-General of Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), Capt. Musa Nuhu, Managing Director of Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN), Capt. Rabiu Hamisu Yadudu; Director-General of Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NIMET), Prof Mansur Matazu; Director Port Health, and other relevant agencies involved in Hajj operations. According to him, there is need to have a smooth, safe and efficient airlift of pilgrims to the Saudi Arabia. He urged them to ensure all airports, aircraft, and airspaces were ready before the inaugural flight.

He thanked the management of the NCAA and other organisations that were part of the airline-screening exercise for their wonderful job. Responding, Capt. Nuhu said all aircraft will be inspected accordingly to ensure they are airworthy before they are allowed into Nigeria’s airspace to commence the Hajj airlift. This, he said, cannot be compromised. Prof Matazu assured that the pre-Hajj inspection will be done, along with close monitoring and observation of the weather before the commencement of each flight.
