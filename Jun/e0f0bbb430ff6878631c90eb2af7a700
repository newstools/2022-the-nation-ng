Reality TV star Oluwabusayo Victoria Abiri aka Khloe has vowed never to attempt another body enhancement procedure. The former BBNaija 2018 edition housemate during a chat with Taymesan on “Tea With Tay” podcast maintained she wouldn’t dare another plastic surgery even if she was offered 100million, though she didn’t clarify the exact currency (whether local or foreign). Stating her reason why she would refuse the offer of another plastic surgery, she noted the process is extremely painful.
