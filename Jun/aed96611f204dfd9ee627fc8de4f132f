Senator Adamu Bulkachuwa (Bauchi North) said yesterday that the aggrived   APC Senators who met with Buhari accused governors of  “deliberate efforts to wrest power” from the people.” He said when he personally complained about the process adopted for the primary, the answers he got showed that governors had “a predetermined mindset.” “I complained about the whole process to party chieftains in my state  and the team that was sent from Abuja to conduct the primary, but the answers I  got were unfriendly,” he said. Blaming a serving minister for his inability to get a return ticket, Bulkachuwa expressed happiness that the President and the party’s leadership had promised to look into the matter.   5 die, nine injured in Lagos-Ibadan road crash     Inmate graduates with 2nd Class Upper from Open University     Two shot dead, 16 abducted in Kaduna   He added:  “The President promised to look into all the grievances. And for those whose cases can be corrected that will be adjusted. “But those whose cases cannot be adjusted will be compensated somehow. “The party leadership and chairman accepted responsibilities and promised to see whatever that could be done to either rescue or adjust the situation.” Bulkachuwa said he was  not happy that many APC chieftains in Bauchi State, including two senators,  “have jumped ship to the opposition.” “I am the only remaining APC Senator in Bauchi State today,” he stressed. He warned that the intra-party crisis in the state was capable of affecting the acceptance of the  APC in next year’s general election.
