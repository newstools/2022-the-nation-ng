We trust our citizens and residents to discern that it is finally time for Osun to stand together and do what is right and necessary to lift our state”. Famodun said the defectors have made the right choice for their political sojourn and future and in the interest of the state. “We welcome the new members to APC, a place of peace and tranquillity,” he added. Also,  Owoeye, who is also the Speaker of the State House of Assembly, described the “mass defection” as another historical feat by  Oyetola. His words: “No other governor has been able to deplete the ranks of the opposition in one fell swoop like this. Governor Oyetola’s calm mien, focussed leadership and determination to change the way the government is run are some of the reasons given by the defectors for joining the APC.”.
