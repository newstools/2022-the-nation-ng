A young man, Jika John, was paraded yesterday by the Adamawa State Police Command for entering a female hostel dressed as a woman, allegedly with intention to steal. The police command said it had established that Jika is a serial thief who specialises in entering the female hostel of the Adamawa State College of Nursing in Yola and stealing mostly gas cylinders. He was one of 15 suspects paraded yesterday at the Police Command headquarters. Four of them are suspected kidnappers. Chief of the police Crack Squad, CSP Ahmed Gombi, who addressed newsmen on the suspects, said of Jika John: “One of the cases is criminal tresspass, a person who dressed as a female and entered the compound of School of Nursing.

We received a distress call that he was about to be lynched, so my men went there, rescued and brought him to the police headquarters. “He has confessed that he is not alone. So we are looking at the possibility of a syndicate. We will go after them one by one,” CSP Ahmed said. Jika told newsmen that he went to the school disguised as a girl because he needed easy access to the female hostel to see a girlfriend of his at the hostel. The Crack Squad chief dismissed this, stressing that Jika is a known gas cylinder thief whose time was up. “The boy has no girlfriend in the institution. We have done our background check. He normally goes there to steal gas cylinders of female students,” he said.
