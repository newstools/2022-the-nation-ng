A woman whose husband was among the train passengers abducted on March 28 has said life has been tough for her and her children since the attack. Mrs Matilda Kabir spoke yesterday amid tears when families of the abducted passengers addressed the press. “For the past 87 days since about 63 passengers of the train attack were kidnapped including my husband, it has not been funny at all. The children kept asking, when will Daddy come back? “We were relieved when 11 people were released the last time with the hope that the rest will be released until we started hearing that some of them were suffering from snakebite and scorpion stings.

We no longer sleep. We are also appealing to government and public-spirited individuals to come to our aid; it is us today but it could be anybody tomorrow,” she said. Relatives of the Abuja-Kaduna train attack pleaded with the Federal government to intensify efforts to secure the release of the remaining 50 abductees. Leaders of the group, Dr Abdulfatai  Jimoh and Ba’aba Muhammad said: “Only 11 people out of the abducted citizens have been reunited with their families, leaving behind 50 innocent Nigerians in the hands of their abductors under horrible conditions of living”. They expressed gladness with the news of President Muhammadu Buhari giving fresh orders to security chiefs to spare no efforts in freeing the remaining 50 hostages alive and in the shortest time possible.
