SS Lazio manager Maurizio Sarri is eyeing a move for Nigerian striker David Okereke ahead of the 2022-23 Serie A season. Sarri guided Lazio to fifth on the league table last campaign, with former Borussia Dortmund forward Ciro Immobile contributing 27 goals in 31 league games. But the former Chelsea manager wants more support for Immobile in attack and has identified Okereke as the perfect foil for the 32-year-old, according to Diretta Goal.

The 24-year-old scored seven goals and added another assist, but it was not enough to prevent Venezia from finishing bottom in Serie A and getting relegated. Okereke still has a contract until June 2023 with parent club Club Brugge and is expected to make a return to Belgium for Italy. Brugge are willing to let the Nigerian youth international leave permanently this summer and will look to recoup a significant part of the €8 million they paid Spezia for his services in 2019.
