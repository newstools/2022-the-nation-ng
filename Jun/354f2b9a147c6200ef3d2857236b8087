The Terms of Reference of the committee are to amongst others, draw up programmes that will revamp basketball from the grassroots, attract corporate sponsors and revive the moribund domestic leagues for the development of the game within two years, and ensure the development of Basketball facilities in the entire country, and any other thing that will facilitate the development of the game in Nigeria. Speaking with our correspondent, Nzekwu said the IMC knows that the task is enormous, but the body is up to it as all the members of the committee are all committed to the development of the game of basketball.
