Only I can talk about how I was because the face and body were mine. I realized it was something manageable by the fact that I didn’t need the stretcher to get out of the field, I was able to stand on my own. At the hospital I told my doctor that I would be out for a maximum of two weeks,” he said. He added: “But then the X-rays revealed that I had multiple bone fractures. They had to remove them and fix them from the inside. I have something like 18 screws under my jaw. “ This injury made me go through a lot, on several nights I couldn’t sleep because of the pain, and it was difficult even to eat. But I’m a lion, I have a strong mentality in the end, and in my mind, I had already planned my return to the field after the intervention.”
