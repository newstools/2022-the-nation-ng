Also to defect formally from the Peoples Democratic Party to the All Progreives Grand Alliance on June15, is the Senate Minority Leader, Enyinnaya Abaribe.   Tinubu urged to intervene in Adamawa APC crisis     Why Ekiti should vote Oyebanji, by Ehinlanwo     APC and the search for running mate   His defection and  exit as Minority Leader was deferred,  given the inability of the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, to come with his defection and resignation letter to plenary. Although an announcement to that effect was made by Lawan, it was however agreed that Abaribe’s letter be formally read on the floor before his exit as Minority Leader, after a point of order raised by Sen. Gabriel Suswam (PDP- Benue).
