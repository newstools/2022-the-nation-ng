TURKISH giants Besiktas are working on a deal to lure former Manchester United loanee Odion Ighalo back to Europe, according to reports from Turkey. After spells at Granada, Udinese, and Watford, Ighalo left Europe in 2017 to join Chinese club CC Yatai in a deal worth over 20 million euros.

Just over a month after returning to Shenhua, Ighalo left China for Saudi Arabia, where he teamed up with Al-Shabab. But he switched to league rivals Al-Hilal SFC at the end of January this year after Al-Shabab refused to allow him to play for Nigeria at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon.
