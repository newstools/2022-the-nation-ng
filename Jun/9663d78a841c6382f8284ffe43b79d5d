The Eselu of Iselu in Yewa North area of Ogun State, Oba Akintunde Akinyemi, has urged churches to install close circuit televisions to monitor movements around their premises. The monarch offered the suggestion in an open letter written to the President of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Revd Supo Ayokunle, following the massacre of many worshippers at the St. Francis Catholic Church in Owo, Ondo State. Oba Akinyemi said footage from the ‘closed-circuit televisions (CCTV) would continually assist the church authorities to alert security agents when their premises are violated by lawless intruders and criminals. The monarch also urged CAN to mandate all churches in the country to purchase modern security gadgets to discourage killings in worship centres.
