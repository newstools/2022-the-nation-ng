I did it to sell my business. So, I don’t think there is anything to be ashamed of in enhancing your body. The media personality further argued people who undergo plastic surgery as well as those who bleach their skin and others who wear false eye lashes are all in the same boat; because they do so to enhance their looks. “People are bleaching…bleaching, make we no talk about am. It’s all the same thing. That is another form of enhancement because it’s not the way God created you. “Even those that fix eyelashes. All these things, if we talk about them; they are the same. So, if you think you are ‘that girl’, leave yourself the way God created you,” she added.
