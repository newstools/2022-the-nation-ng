Four reigning African champions, Tobiloba Amusan (100m hurdles), Ese Brume (Long Jump), Chioma Onyekwere (Discus Throw) and Chukwuebuka Enekwechi (Shot Put) top the list of 54 athletes to  represent Nigeria at the 22nd  African Athletics Championships  holding between June 8 and 12  in Mauritius. Amusan will be competing in two individual events and the 4x100m relay. She has been listed to compete in the women’s 100m alongside Godbless Tima Seikeseye and Praise Ofoku as well as in the 100m hurdles where she will be defending the title she first won in Asaba four years ago at the 21st edition of the Championships. Brume will be gunning for her fourth straight long jump title after winning in 2014, 2016 and 2018 while Onyekwere will be seeking her second discus title after winning the gold medal four years ago in Asaba. Shot Putter, Enekwechi will also be defending the event’s title he won in Asaba with a new 21.08m Championships record. Also on the list are Orobosa Anabel Frank who is the top ranked African so far this year in the women’s Shot Put with her 17.21m effort at the AFN All Comers competition in Benin in March as well as Oyesade Olatoye in the women’s Hammer throw. Others are  Fadekemi Olude in the women’s 10km walk and Patience Okon George, bronze medal winner in the 400m event in 2014. For the men, reigning African Games 100 champion, Raymond Ekevwo will lead Seye Ogunlewe and Nicholas Mabilo as Nigeria will be seeking to return to the podium as champions 12 long years after Olusoji Fasuba was crowned the African speed king for the third straight time. AFN Technical Director, Samuel Onikeku said  the athletes have been carefully selected based on their performances in both the local and international athletics circuit. “Some of our student athletes in the United States of America including  Favour Ofili, Rosemary Chukwuma, Imaobong Nse Uko, Favour Ashe, Udodi Onwuzurike, Nathaniel Ezekiel, Alaba Akintola and Nnamdi Prosper have qualified for the 2022 NCAA Outdoor Championships scheduled to hold in Eugene, Oregon, USA between June 8 and 11, 2022 and will thus not be available for the African Athletics Championships hence the decision to pick the bulk of the team from athletes based at home,” Onikeku said . Nigeria won a total of 20 medals made up of nine gold, five silver and six bronze medals to finish third in the medal table behind Kenya and South Africa at the 21st edition held in Asaba, Delta. The country however tops the all-time medal table with a total of 368 medals made up of 155 gold, 122 silver and 91 bronze medals.      Team Nigeria contingent to Mauritius Women 100m Godbless Tima Seikeseye Praise Ofoku Tobi Amusan 200m Praise Idamadudu Godbless Tima Seikeseye 400m Patience Okon Praise Idamadudu Opeyemi Oke 100m Hurdles Tobi Amusan Miracle Thompson Joy Abu 400m Hurdles Abasiano Akpan Sarah Ochigbo Heptathlon Kemi Francis 10km Race-walk Fadekemi Olude Discus Choima Onyekwere Obiageri Amechi Princess Kara Shot Put Anabel Orobosa Sade Olatoye   Hammer Sade Olatoye Queen Obisesan High Jump Temitope Adesina Triple Jump Mercy Honesty Onara Obamuwagun Long Jump Ese Brume Ruth Agadama 4x100m Godbless Tima Seikeseye Tobi Amusan Praise Ofoku Ese Brume Ruth Agadama Yakubu Bilikis Joy Abu 4x400m Patience Okon   UCL: Heineken ends season in style with fans     Prudent Energy H’ball League: Unbeaten Safety Babes  record…     Ex- Enyimba’s coach Cooreman dies in Belgium   Ella Onojuvwewo Opeyemi Deborah Oke Praise Idamadudu Osunobun Queen Osaretin Joy Usunbor Joy Abu     Men 100m Seye Ogunlewe Raymond Ekewvwo Nicholas Mabilo 200m Fakorede Nicholas Adekalu Chidi Okezie 400m Samson Nathaniel Adeyemi Sikiru Chidera Johnson 110m Hurdles Prosper Ekporere Abejoye Oyeniyi Alex Al-Ameen 400m Hurdles Rilwan Alowonle Decathlon Osadolor Samuel Discus Ugeoke Vicent Javelin Adams Kure Samuel Shot Put Chukwuebuka Enekwechi Dotun Ogundeji Long Jump Tobechukwu Emmanuel Nwokpcha Ineh Emmanuel Oritsemeyiwa Tripple Jump Kalu Chidozie Ikenga High Jump David Aya 4x100m Seye Ogunlewe Raymond Ekwevwo Oghene Ogho Egwero Fakorede Nicholas Adekalu Mabilo Nicholas Karlington Anunagba 4x400m Samson Nathaniel Adewale Sikiru Nnamani Johnson Chidera Ayo Toriseju Adeola Ifeanyi Emmanuel Ojeli Chidi Okezie 4x400m Mixed Relay Nathiel Samson Ifeanyi Ojeli Sikiru Adeyemi Patience Okon Opeyemi Oke Idamadudu Praise
