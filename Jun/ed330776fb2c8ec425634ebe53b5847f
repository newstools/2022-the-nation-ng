Super Eagles coach Jose Peseiro has stated that despite their 1-0 loss to Ecuador, Nigeria put up a better performance than the previous game against Mexico, in which they lost 2-1. The Super Eagles locked horns with Ecuador in their second game under Peseiro. However, the result did not go as expected, as an early goal from Pervis Estupinan was enough to do the damage for La Tri.

Following the loss, Super Eagles tactician Peseiro believes that there was a rise in performance levels, and he believes that if the team gets more time to train together, they will perform better. “I think we played much better than Mexico,” Peseiro said at the presser after the game, as per Colin Udoh.
