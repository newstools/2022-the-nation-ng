The report stated: “Rising global risks will weaken domestic operating conditions as any downside to operating conditions, inflation (17.7 per cent in May 2022) is expected to remain stubbornly high, posing downside risks to real GDP growth forecasts of 3.1 per cent and 3.3 per cent in 2022 and 2023.’’ However, downside risks are somewhat mitigated by strong oil prices, which should also underpin growth in non-oil sectors and banks’ asset quality”. It stated. It reiterated that the Viability Rating of Ecobank Nigeria reflects its standalone creditworthiness despite the concentration of its operations within Nigeria’s challenging operating environment, high credit concentrations, asset-quality weaknesses, modest profitability, and weak capitalisation in the context of these risks. It also reflects a sizeable franchise and a healthy funding and liquidity profile.
