Former Niger Governor Babangida Aliyu has stated that Labour Party (LP) presidential candidate Peter Obi cannot win the 2023 poll. Aliyu said Obi is a good candidate but 2023 would be too early for him to make it.   We’ll fix Justices’ complaints on work…     Remaining kidnapped railway passengers must be rescued…     Portable needs rehabilitation, says Okowa’s aide   He spoke during an interview on Channels TV programme monitored by The Nation. Aliyu said: “Peter Obi is my good friend and a former member of my former Governors forum. A very excellent person. His candidature, in terms of the Presidency, – I think he will make some name now. But he may be able to make it only in 2027, 2031. But 2023? Too early. “Even though the young people might go for him, the name is not dropping everywhere else. I doubt if Nigerians are ready for him now as a presidential person. “I would have loved him as a Vice President. Many of us were rooting for him to be Vice President to Atiku again.”
