Super Eagles coach Jose Peseiro is happy with his side’s performance in the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers, but he still believes that they could still improve in some areas. Peseiro took over the reins of the Super Eagles in May, but he lost his opening two games against Ecuador and Mexico by one-goal margins. However, under his tutelage, Nigeria rose from the two defeats and fought back to beat Sierra Leone in their opening fixture of the AFCON 2023 Qualifiers. The Super Eagles had to cope with the absence of fans, and the situation was worsened by the plantation-like pitch. Still, they ground out the 2-1 win.

Nigeria’s next game is in August when they play Guinea Bissau in their third fixture of the qualifiers. But in the meantime, Peseiro is happy with his team’s performance. “We achieved our goal of points won, grew as a group, and conquered a historical record, always based on fundamental values: team spirit and mutual help”, the Portuguese tactician tweeted on his Social media platform Twitter handle. “We made the Nigerian nation proud. We are focused on improving our work to achieve our goals,” he added.
