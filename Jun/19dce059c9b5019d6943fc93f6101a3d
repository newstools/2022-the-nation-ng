He also noted that the music industry is a means of attracting tourism to the country.   Excitement as MCSN holds AGM     Nuno Zigi set for debut EP NDO     Obi Asika speaks on Journey of the Beats documentary   “International shows increase the spending capacity of our talents and in most cases, when an artist makes more money, their spending capacities increase and it trickles down to the economy,” said Dominate. “According to the last stat I saw, the creative industry in Nigeria is worth about 4.5 billion dollars. Do you know how much that would do for the country if there was properly structured? For me, asides from putting the country on the global map and for the right reasons, which attracts investors from all works of life be it tourists or what have you, it attracts them to come to experience the greatness from the abode which the talent comes from. “The ministry of tourism and hospitality would see tremendous growth if we see more artistes headline shows outside the country, for example, take a look at Felabration, see the number of people who travel from all works of life to be a part of it. I remember when Davido won the BET award and he was inviting people on the stage to come to Africa, come eat the food and all, the same thing Burna Boy’s mom did, it just creates an avenue for the development.”
