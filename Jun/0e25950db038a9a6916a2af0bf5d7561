Deputy Senate President and Delta APC’s governorship candidate, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, has rewarded brave tanker driver, Ejiro Otarigho, with a personal donation of N1 million. On June 10, Otarigho averted monumental disaster when he drove his burning petrol tanker away from a densely-populated area in Agbarho, Delta State, to the riverside. His action was believed to have saved hundreds of lives and property worth millions of naira.

Responding, Otarigho thanked Omo-Agege for the gesture, even as he seized the opportunity to debunk media reports that he was not interested in a national honour but a new tanker. “I look forward to coming to Abuja for the national honour recommended for me to the president by the Senate. I thank Senator Omo-Agege again for moving the motion,’’ Otarigho said. The foregoing were made known in Abuja through a statement issued by Mr Ima Niboro, Director, Communications and Media Strategy, Omo-Agege Campaign Organisation, yesterday. Last week, the Senate recommended Otarigho to President Muhammadu Buhari for a national honour.
