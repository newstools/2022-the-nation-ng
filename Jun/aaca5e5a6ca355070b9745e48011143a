The New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) says Sen. Rabiu Kwankwaso, a former governor of Kano State, remains its sole presidential candidate to fly its ticket in the 2023 general elections. Dr. Boniface Aniebonam, NNPP pioneer National Chairman and founder, disclosed this at a news conference on Friday in Lagos. Aniebonam said that the party’s Special National Convention scheduled for June 8 in Abuja was just to confirm Kwankwaso, a former Defence Minister, as the candidate of NNPP. “He (Kwankwaso) is to be returned unopposed. Kwankwaso is a man of God.

What Nigeria need now is a strong leader like Kwankwaso. He is a man with character and patriotism; with capacity for human development. When we get a strong leader, all agitations will die a natural death. If Kwankwaso emerges the President, some of these problems will be resolved,” he said. The founder said that only divine leadership could solve Nigeria’s numerous challenges. Aniebonam said the popular Kano politician had the divine voice of God to lead on the platform of NNPP. He added that the responsibility before Kwankwaso was to reunite Nigerians, address insecurity through a revamped economy, employment opportunities and social services. “Let Nigeria start again from the beginning. Kwankwaso is coming in to bring everybody together to end all these challenges. He is going to bring Nigerians together and he is going to re unite this country. Therefore, a mandate for Kwankwaso is to reverse the trend and to make Nigeria a productive nation. The messenger of God has come. God’s hand is in NNPP. Let the people take their destiny in their hand in 2023,” he said.
