The two meetings by the governors on the president’s proposal ended in a deadlock. The first meeting was held after the meeting with the President. According to sources, a suggestion at the meeting of the Progressives Governors Forum (PGF) that two of their members, one from the North and one from the South, should be picked and presented to the president generated heated argument.

Sources said that Southern governors, who were taken aback by the statement, also wondered why the South should vote for a Northern candidate to succeed President Buhari. The meeting was reconvened in the night where some governors said the president’s statement that the APC should pick a candidate who is a party man and who can win the election should henceforth guide them. There was another suggestion that aspirants should go to the primary for the best aspirant to emerge as standard bearer.
