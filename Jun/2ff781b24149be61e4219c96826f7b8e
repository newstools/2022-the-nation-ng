Actress Omoni Oboli has compared social media to real life, baring her reasons. Oboli noted social media is gradually taking the form of real life and people should imbibe the culture of employing kind words during periods spent on it. She reasoned being mean on social media because one wants to look cool or earn the tag ‘savage’ will bring no good to anyone. The mother of three wrote: “Social media is slowly becoming ‘real life’ so darling, if you won’t take a knife to stab someone in real life, don’t do it on social media.
