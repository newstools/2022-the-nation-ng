Wayne Rooney has told Derby County that he wishes to leave his role as manager with immediate effect, the club announced yesterday. The news comes after Derby were relegated from the Championship to third-tier League One this past season having being handed two separate points deductions for entering administration and breaching financial rules earlier in the season. The club have also been operating under a transfer embargo. “Over the course of the Summer I have been closely following developments regarding the ownership of Derby County,” Rooney wrote in a club statement.

In fairness to them, they tried tremendously hard to change my decision but my mind was made up. “My time at the club has been a rollercoaster of emotions, both highs and lows, but I have to say that I have enjoyed the challenge. “Personally, I feel the club now needs to be led by someone with fresh energy and not affected by the events that have happened over the last eighteen months. I will remember my time at Derby with great pride and affection and would like to thank all my staff, players and of course the fans for their incredible support. I will never forget you and hope to see you all again in the near future and in happier times.” Last week, American businessman Chris Kirchner withdrew his bid to purchase the club. Finally, I am aware that the club still have interested parties who wish to take over the running of the club,” Rooney added. “To them I say this, Derby County is a great club with a great history and great fans. I wish you all the best and much success for the future.”
