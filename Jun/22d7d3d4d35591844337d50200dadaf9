Shukurat Kareem was the star of the day as the monthly Lagos “Saturday Boxing Show’’ resumed this weekend at the Molade Okoya-Thomas Sports Hall, Teslim Balogun Stadium, Lagos after two months hiatus due to the annual Ramadan fasting. The vibrant teenager’s flurry of punches proved decisive in her 5-0 unanimous victory over Anuoluwapo Akanini of Always Boxing Club. Shukurat, fighting for Brightest Boxing Club, told NationSport after her impressive win that she wants to represent the country at the next Youth Olympic Games.

I have represented Lagos at the Nigeria Youth Games and I believe by the grace of God and hard work, I will represent the country soon,” she said. Shukurat, who comes from a boxing family, said that she initially did not want to become a boxer but seeing other young girls being trained by her father, who is a coach, she decided to give the sport a try and became very good at it as her father believed she had the natural skills to be a successful boxer. Another impressive boxer at Nigeria’s prestigious amateur boxing event on Saturday was Michael Olomitutu who stunned the crowd by knocking down Joseph Udume with a vicious right-hand punch in the second round of their male 85kg fight. Taofeek Faruq of Calisto Boxing Club was equally impressive, beating Hammed Opeyemi of Hardpunch Boxing Club by a 5-0 unanimous victory in the 54kg weight class.
