Super Eagles hard-tackling midfielder Winfred Ndidi has returned to the Leicester City squad as the Foxes resumed pre-season training at their Seagrave training complex yesterday. Leicester shared an update showing the midfielder taking part in pre-season with the rest of his teammates. The video showed Ndidi taking part in drills outside on the pitches along with a message reading: “Back with the squad… Looking good out there, @Ndidi25” Ndidi was ruled out for the rest of the season after sustaining a knee injury during the Foxes second leg clash with Rennes in the UEFA Europa League in mid-March and since had surgery on his medial ligament in his knee, missing the final 16 games of the season in all competitions. His presence in the Super Eagles midfield was a regrettable absence in Nigeria’s FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Ghana in March. The Super Eagles failed to qualify as their neighbours went through on away goals, as the game ended 1-1 on aggregate.

The likes of Jamie Vardy, James Maddison, Harvey Barnes and Marc Albrighton were among those back in on day one of pre-season. Meanwhile, Ndidi’s compatriots in Leicester, Kelechi Iheanacho and Ademola Lookman were missing at Seagrave yesterday. It is rumoured that Rodgers wants to offload Iheanacho despite the 25-year-old ending last season on a high while there have been no communication with RB Leipzig for Lookman, who was on loan from the German side with an option of signing him permanently, indicating as unwillingness to make the deal permanent.
