The National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Senator Abdullahi Adamu has described the defection of Senators elected on the platform of the party as unfortunate and worrisome. Abdullahi spoke with reporters after a closed-door meeting with APC Senators at the National Assembly. On the wave of defections rocking APC Senators, Abdullahi said: “It is an unfortunate development when it happens but this is a season for all manner of behaviours in the political space in the country and Nigeria is not an exception. “In every election year, this kind of thing gives cause for stakeholders to sneeze and Nigeria is not an exception so is the APC is not an exception. I don’t care about what is happening in other parties, my focus is on the APC. “But we all know that the occurrence is not only happening in the APC. It’s happening across other political parties too. And because we are the ruling party, our problems are exaggerated before the public.”   NUT lashes Kaduna, rejects sack of 2,357 teachers     Abductors starved us for almost three days – Former…     Military officer’s wife, six others kidnapped in Kaduna   On whether he was worried that Senators are dumping the party, he said: “There is no responsible leader that would not be worried when he loses one member not to talk of two. At the moment we are faced with the stark reality of our problems. “My colleagues and I at the National Working Committee of the APC are committed to face the problem squarely and see the problem as solvable. “We are in politics, I don’t know what would happen tomorrow, and nobody does.” On how to stem the issue of injustice being raised by some of the defectors, he said: “You have no guarantee, we are in politics for God’s sake. “I don’t know what will happen tomorrow. How can I foresee tomorrow? I am not the person who saw tomorrow.” Adamu said he doesn’t know if the problem of defection would continue but believes the issue is surmountable since he has met with the senators.
