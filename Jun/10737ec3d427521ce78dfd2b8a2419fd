Despite several offers across Europe, Super Eagles midfielder Joe Aribo has hinted that he would love to remain with Rangers for next season. Aribo through Instagram affirmed his commitment to the Scottish Cup champion. There have been reports, stating that several clubs are interested in Rangers winger this summer, with Steven Gerrard among those keen on a reunion from their time at Ibrox in the Scottish Premiership together.

The Nigerian has impressed last season for the Gers, especially in the Scottish Premiership after he netted eight times and chipped in with six assists in 34 games. With the speculation of a move away from Ibrox in the summer for Aribo, he has taken to Instagram to thank the Gers faithful and has hinted that he going to remain with the club, as he wrote: “Can’t wait to get going next season.” Rangers fell just short in the Scottish Premiership and the Europa League final, so to ensure that they compete again in all competitions next term, it is vital for Van Bronckhorst to keep his key players such as Aribo at the club.
