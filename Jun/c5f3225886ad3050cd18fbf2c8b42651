The Lagos State Government has begun the building of a cultural village at Ijan in Alimosho Local Government. Commissioner for Tourism, Arts and Culture, Mrs.Uzamat Akinbile-Yusuf, said the project would activate the rich, diverse human culture and heritage resources in Alimosho, as well as promote the sustainable development of tourism as a viable sector of the economy. She added the centre would position Lagos as the next tourism destination, as it was expected to attract tourists to the state and increase its Gross Domestic Product (GDP).   ‘Nigerian political parties lack ideology’     Assembly candidate seeks massive votes for Tinubu     Coalition urges Benin monarch to abolish title   She said: “The idea of the village is to replicate how the Yoruba lived in the past and as a way of preserving our culture for the younger generation. It is also designed to attract tourists from the diaspora to the state. “The project will include a traditional Oba’s palace with a complete Yoruba cultural setting. There will be shrines for the celebrated Yoruba traditional gods such as Ogun, Obatala and Sango, among others. The village will also feature a research centre, a museum for the display of cultural artefacts, and shops for adire makers where visitors can have their adire materials sown into a boubou while waiting. Tourists can equally visit saloons to have their hair made in the traditional style or eat at restaurants that will serve local cuisines and palm wine among others.” The Chairman, Lagos State House of Assembly Committee on Commerce, Industries and Cooperatives, Bisi Yusuf, said the project would be sustained by the community. The Chairman of Ayobo-Ipaja Local Council Development Area (LCDA), Mrs. Bola Sobowale, hailed Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu for starting the project, noting that it would further develop the area and transform it into an important tourism site.
