Edo State Deputy Governor Philip Shaibu yesterday marked Father’s Day by helping out in church as an altar server. Shaibu, who served as the Chief Mass Servant at the St. Paul Catholic Church in Benin City, urged parents to imbibe the culture of godliness in their homes by bringing up their children in the ways of God. He described a godly home as the best way to get at the root of the problems of insurgency and kidnapping in the country. According to him, the starting point of building a nation is by building homes and urged fathers to amplify things that will unite the country.

If we can act as St. Joseph in the Bible, then the issues of insecurity will be history in Nigeria,” Shaibu said. Urging parents to be agents of unity and love, he advised fathers to work with mothers to build homes that will contribute to the development, peace, and security of the nation. “We must continue to build a bottom-up society in which parents draw strength from their homes just as leaders draw power not from themselves or even their office but the masses,” the Deputy Governor said. According to him, the Governor Godwin Obaseki administration had been engaged in the implementation of developmental programmes to enhance the economic status of parents and would continue to empower parents to enable them to take care of the needs of their children. “As a government, we will continue to create opportunities for wealth creation through the necessary infrastructural facilities that will enhance commercial activities in the state.’’
