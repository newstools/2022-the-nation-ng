With the exception of the required departures and a last-minute addition of a striker to provide Karim Benzema with backup, Real Madrid’s squad for the 2022/23 season is mostly set. But with the addition of Aurelien Tchouameni and Antonio Rudiger, it’s clear to see what Carlo Ancelotti’s plans for the campaign will be. The addition of these two big players has added to the physical strength that Fede Valverde, Eduardo Camavinga, Vinicius Junior, Ferland Mendy, Eder Militao, and David Alaba have, making Real Madrid a force to be reckoned with. It would be wrong to say that physicality is this side’s strongest quality. Real Madrid have brought in outstanding players, but there is no denying that skill and quick feet are not the main factors that contribute to success in football today.

However, he also has an eye for goal. The same could be said about Alaba, whose versatility allows him to play as a centre-back, full-back, or central midfielder, and is tall and stocky. Without any doubt, Vinicius is the best example of physicality in conjunction with talent. His wear and tear from every game is immeasurable, yet the Brazilian adds talent to the kilometres of running he puts in attacking and defending until he wears down his markers. Under Ancelotti, Valverde has proven himself worthy of his position. He has contributed more energy to help Casemiro in that area in a less physical midfield with Toni Kroos and Luka Modric, especially when the Brazilian has been out.
