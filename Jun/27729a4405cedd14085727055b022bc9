Lekki Port has restated its commitment to environmental sustainability. To celebrate World Environment Day 2022, it teamed up with African Marine Environment Sustainability Initiative (AFMESI) to carry out a clean-up exercise of the beach and coastal environment of Magbon Segun and Oke Segun communities in the Ibeju Lekki area of Lagos State. The theme for this year’s World Environment Day, which was marked on June 6, is ‘Only One Earth’. It was a call for collective, transformative action on a global scale to celebrate, protect and restore our planet. The clean-up initiative was put together as part of Lekki Port’s efforts to ensure environmental justice.

He said: “Lekki Port is continually committed to the environment by upscaling its investment in the sustainability of its host communities through the creation of better household waste management and awareness of the impact of waste on humans and the environment. “We thank our Baales and the host communities for allowing us to carry out this clean-up event in their space and we will surely ensure that it is not a one-off occasion. “We are all enjoined to celebrate, protect and restore our planet starting with our immediate environment.” AFMESI Founder/President, Dr Felicia Mogo, said the initiative was borne out of the need to curb waste dumping with intervention programmes to support the communities, such as the provision of waste bins and tools while creating awareness of the impact of waste. “Lekki Port has set a very good example. Other organisations and individuals present are being invited to join hands with Lekki Port to ensure sustainable development,” she said.
