Every fight needs an instigator. Every chaos needs a spanner. Once the quorum is reached for the communion of spirits, someone is required to extinguish the torch. ABN- Association for Better Nigeria was a lot of things to many people, but it sowed the seed of discord which blossomed into the sheer anarchy of June 12. BADAMASI is boldly naming names on Amazon Prime.”   Bisola Aiyeola returns as host for Shoot Your Shot Season…     Iro Nla is not about politics, says Orbitz Voice     Fans hail Adoki’s creativity on Loke Loke   BADAMASI: Portrait of a General narrates the circumstances and personalities that played active and passive roles in that episodic watershed in Nigeria’s socio-political history, dominated by Ibrahim Babangida, Sanni Abacha, and MKO Abiola, the acclaimed winner of the June 12, 1993, presidential election.
