The crisis rocking the Nigeria Basketball Federation (NBBF) took another twist globally as the world governing body for basketball, FIBA has named Mali as Nigeria’s D’Tigress replacement at the 2022 FIBA Women’s Basketball World Cup in Sydney, Australia. FIBA’s decision to replace Nigeria was based on the decision by the Federal Government through the Ministry of Youth and Sports Development to withdraw  Nigeria from all international tournaments for two years. The NBBF has been embroiled in a leadership crisis after the July 2021 election with two separate elections held in Benin and Abuja producing Musa Kida and Mark Igoche as presidents and this prompted the government to withdraw the country from all international tournaments for two years while an Interim Management Committee (IMC) has been set up to oversee the affairs of the sport in the country.
