The Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) has withdrawn its threat to sue the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The energy distributor on Monday vowed to drag the commission after it claimed the operatives assaulted its staff. Arising from a meeting on Friy, the AEDC management said: “Following this high-level engagement, both sides resolved to settle all the issues amicably and forge ahead in the interest of peace and mutual cooperation.

Continuing, AEDC said: “We are pleased to inform the general public that in a swift and positive turn of events, the recent friction between our great company, Abuja Electricity Distribution Plc and the EFCC, has been resolved. “This was the outcome of a meeting between senior officials of both organisations where it came to the fore that the recent incident at our corporate headquarters involving some of our staff and officials of the EFCC on 6 June 2022, was as a result of misinformation and misunderstanding.”
