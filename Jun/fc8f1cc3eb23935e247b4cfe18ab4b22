Award-winning artistes Wizkid and Simi have emerged leaders of the Class of 2022 nominees for the sixth edition of the annual NET Honours People’s Choice Awards. The organisers, ID Africa, disclosed the artistes secured four nominations each for the audience data-based awards.

Simi attracted nominations for the Most Popular Musician (Female), Most Searched Musician (Female), Most Popular Fandom (Music), and Most Popular Couple. The feat makes Simi the most-nominated artiste for the second time in two seasons after her impressive six nods in 2021. Davido and Burna Boy, like Wizkid, have also maintained an impressive grip on the global music space in the year under review, with three nominations each in the Most Popular Music Artiste (Male), Most Searched Music Artiste (Male); and Most Popular Fandom (Music) categories. Other notable nominations include Mr Macaroni, Sabinus, Kiekie, Taaooma, and Broda Shaggi, who secured two nominations each for Most Popular Comedian and Most Popular Social Content Creator. According to the owners of Nigerian Entertainment Today (Netng), this year’s edition features 35 categories, including 15 new voting categories that will give fans more power to choose their favourite celebrities for the awards. Netng initiated NET Honours to recognise and celebrate Nigerians’ favourite celebrities and public figures who have contributed to shaping the most exciting pop culture topics and events in the year under review. NET Honours debuted in 2013 as a special recognition award presented to deserving individuals in the Nigerian entertainment industry during the Nigerian Entertainment Conference (NECLive). In 2016, it evolved into NET Honours People’s Choice Awards. Due to the pandemic in 2020, the awards went virtual, reaching over 10 million people worldwide. “NET Honours provides useful data on popular culture trends and the interests of urban youth in Africa. “The platform is a valuable source of insights for brands, organisations and governments that are trying to understand young Africans and their digital media consumption habits,” says Femi Falodun, the CEO of Info Digital Africa (ID Africa), owners of Netng, Neusroom, 234Star, and Orin. NET Honours focuses on recognising achievers in the entertainment industry through a thorough analysis of online audience search, consumer interest, social media interactions and search trends on Netng’s website, social media platforms and other related channels. Data for the awards are based on audience engagement from a database of over 10 million internet users reached across Netng’s website and social media channels between June 2021 and May 2022. This year, NET Honours has introduced 15 new voting categories for the first time in six years. The new categories are Most Popular DJ, Most Popular Dancer/Video Vixen, Most Popular Music Producer, Breakout Artiste of the Year, Social Content Creator of the Year, Most Popular Video Director (Music Video/Skit), Most Popular Fandom (Music). Others include Most Popular Fandom (BBNaija), Most Popular Celebrity Stylist, Most Popular Designer, Most Popular Photographer, Breakout Actor of the Year, Breakout Actress of the Year, Breakout Artiste of the Year (Male), and Breakout Artiste of the Year (Female). Online voting for the 15 new categories will commence at 7 pm WAT on thenet.ng/honours, after the unveiling of nominees and will end by midnight on Tuesday, June 28.
