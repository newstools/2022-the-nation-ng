Eddie Hearn was the only one smiling as Anthony Joshua and Oleksandr Usyk refused to blink in their intense face-off. The heavyweights took the stage in Saudi Arabia ahead of their rematch on August 20 in Jeddah. When the pair posed for pictures the psychological warfare soon started as both refused to take their eyes off each other. Even when Usyk, 35, manoeuvred to face the photographers he was still locked into a staring match with AJ. Joshua, who was beaten initially in September, reluctantly broke first after over 90 seconds to pose for the cameras. He first suffered defeat to Andy Ruiz Jr, 32, in 2019 but won the rematch in the controversial Saudi region six months later. Joshua, 32, now returns to the Middle East with the same revenge mission with his eyes on becoming a three-time champion.

We are still on the road to undisputed. “I am focused on the target sitting over there and, God willing, I will perform and become three-time heavyweight champion of the world. “With Ruiz, people could see things weren’t 100 per cent but you have to be strong and thick skinned. “When I win I keep it moving and you have to be the same in defeat. I knew I could come back. “Usyk bust my arse for some rounds and I have to take that defeat well, as well. “I was wrong in September and he was right and I have to reverse that on August 20. “I am going to keep things simple, there is genius in simplicity, move forward and the date will soon come.”
