Ndanusa said:  “Nigeria has relied almost a hundred percent on oil and we are not making a lot now from oil, oil is drying up so we need to diversify our economy to be able to sustain the country if we don’t do that we will be in trouble. ‘’So right now, this summit is to look at ways to improve our export and I will tell you that women are branching into export a lot and women need all the assistance that we can get to improve their product because we are the Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and if we add values to our products most of us are into exportable goods and services if we add value to what we have, even the women alone can sustain the GDP of this nation’’.
