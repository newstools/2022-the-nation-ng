Osun 2022: Why we’ll return Oyetola for second term…     Diri: Steering Bayelsa to path of prosperity     2023: A parliament of former governors?   According to him, the smooth conduct of the election is an indication of what to expect in 2023 general elections as democracy continues to grow firm roots in Nigeria under the APC government, led by President Muhammadu Buhari.
