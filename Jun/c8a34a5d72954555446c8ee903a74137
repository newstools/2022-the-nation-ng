Despite signing Lucas Digne from Everton in January, Aston Villa may be on the hunt for another left-back this summer. Steven Gerrard may be looking to replace Matt Targett who’s surplus to requirements and is believed to have an eye on Rangers’ Calvin Bassey. The 22-year-old is coming off the back of a fantastic season with the Gers and is a player Giovanni van Bronckhorst would love to keep at the Ibrox Stadium, but a transfer will be granted of his £25m asking price is met. Alan Hutton believes Villa will pull the trigger this summer. He told Football Insider: “I could see Villa paying it. Steven Gerrard knows him inside out and bought him to Rangers. (He’s) powerful, playing at such a high level so young (and has) got a lot more to give. He’s only going to get better.
