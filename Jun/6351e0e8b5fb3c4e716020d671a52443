So the lesson for ladies is that you don’t have to wait for a man before you can meet your needs. You should be able to do certain things yourself. Because if a man should take you into his house, and does whatever he wants to you at his own will, it will make your life not have any meaningful value. But our lives are valuable. So, we have to wake up to do something meaningful,” she said. Ile Alayo, which is produced and directed by Femi Adebayo for StarTimes Nigeria features Broda Shaggi, Mr. Macaroni, Femi Adebayo, and Adedimeji Lateef amongst others.
