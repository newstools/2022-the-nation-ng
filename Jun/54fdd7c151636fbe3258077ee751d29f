NPC Executive Chairman Nasir Isa Kwarra unveiled the call centre at a ceremony yesterday in Abuja. Kwarra gave the theme of the head count as: 2023 Population and Housing Census: You Count, Be Counted. The NPC boss said the centre would prepare the commission for successful conduct of the first digital census in Nigeria.

He said: “It was, therefore, imperative to put in place a platform for constant interaction between the commission and the people through which information can be obtained, clarified and feedback received on the census process. “The inauguration of the call centre ahead of the actual enumeration of persons in April 2023 is, therefore, a clear indication of the commitment of the commission to conduct a people-oriented 2023 population and housing census. “The launch of this integrated call centre for the 2023 census is yet another major step towards making the 2023 census a resounding success and underscores our commitment of providing demographic data for national planning.”
