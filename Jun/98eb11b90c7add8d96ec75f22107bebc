At the 35th  minute of the Portugal vs Switzerland match, Ronaldo smashed in from 12 yards after being teed up by Diogo Jota. His earlier attempt was at the 14th  minute when Gregor Kobel punched out his shot, but William Carvalho was quickest to react, putting the ball behind Switzerland’s goalkeeper. Some 19 years after making his debut for Portugal, Ronaldo has scored 117 goals for his country in 188 games. The 37-year old is expected to be on the lineup  today against the Czech Republic who have been unbeaten  so far in their campaign after drawing Spain in their last encounter. While Portugal leads the Czech Republic with just a goal difference in League A Group 2, both countries are set to battle at the ‘Estádio José Alvalade’ in what is expected to be a memorable encounter.
