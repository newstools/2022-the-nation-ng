The All Progressives Congress (APC) Oshodi-Isolo Constituency 01 candidate for the Lagos State House of Assembly Otunba Stephen Ogundipe has rallied support for the APC Presidential Candidate Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. Ogundipe urged Nigerians to vote massively for Tinubu in 2023 general elections. According to him, Tinubu is experience enough to build on the achievements of President Muhammadu Buhari. “No doubt, Mr President has done well in the areas of infrastructure and others. With Asiwaju Tinubu as his successor, it would be a round peg in a round hole. Lagos state is what it is today as the fifth largest economy in Africa because of Tinubu’s vision. If he can turn around the Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) millions to billions of naira, you can imagine what he would do at the federal level,” he said.   ‘Nigerian political parties lack ideology’     Coalition urges Benin monarch to abolish title     Lagos to pilgrims: don’t flout Saudi laws   Ogundipe, who polled 20 votes to defeat the incumbent, Hakeem Olusola Sokunle, who got four votes during the primary election, said Tinubu laid the foundation for modern Lagos. He described Tinubu’s victory at the primary election as a testament of his commitment to ensuring a prosperous Nigeria. Ogundipe, who was recently elected as the Vice Chairman of The Island Club, hailed the northern governors for insisting that the south should produce the party’s presidential candidate. He commended other presidential aspirants that stepped down for Asiwaju Tinubu, saying they would be remembered for their contributions to sustenance of democracy. He thanked the delegates for trusting the former governor of Lagos with their votes.
