Manufacturers in the country spent over N71.22 billion on buying diesel for alternative power in 2021 alone, the Manufacturing Association of Nigeria (MAN) has revealed. Making this revelation was the President of MAN, Engr. Mansur Ahmed. He spoke in Lagos, recently. According to him, the cost of providing alternative power was still very high in 2021. Specifically, he said, “Our survey showed that the average daily supply of electricity has been stable at 11 hours and power outage, three times per day respectively, however, the N71.22 billion is on the high side.” He also added that the billions spent on energy threw manufacturing cost structure overboard, eroded working capital and impacted on capacity utilisation.

Furthermore, Ahmed in MAN’s review of the economy in 2021 noted that manufacturers’ huge expenditure on alternative energy sources constitutes between 30 and 40 per cent of their cost structure.” “Between July and December, 2021 in the sector, expenditure on alternative energy sources dipped to N45.04 billion from N57.75 billion recorded in the corresponding half of 2020. The drop indicates N12.71 billion or 22.0 per cent decline over the period. It is however an increase of N12.86 billion or 40 per cent over N32.18 billion of the preceding.” Ahmed also stated that data collected in the survey of this report shows that electricity supply from the national grid showed increased improvement in the second half of 2021. On the alternative energy source implications, the industrialist said, “Since the average Nigerian’s disposable income has been depleted, we can only expect that the resulting higher prices of goods will further constrain purchases and aggravate the poverty level.
