Bamgboye said their visit followed many unresolved complaints by the community members against EKEDC’s estimated bills, arguing that electricity supply in the community was not enough to warrant such high bills. He urged the energy supplier to investigate and stop the increments on their bills. “We don’t know why they keep increasing the bills; electricity bill is now competing with house rent,” a youth leader representing Onireke and its suburb, Mr Jamiu Adeosun, added. One of the EKEDC officers that attended to the delegation invited the three community heads for a meeting behind closed doors.
