Former Nottingham Forest ace Stan Collymore has said that club-record signing Taiwo Awoniyi remains a perfect bargain for Steve Cooper-tutored side. He also tipped the Super Eagles to make his mark in the Premier League. The Reds shelled out £17.5m to secure the services of the 24-year-old from Union Berlin and he became their first arrival of the summer as he put pen to paper on a five-year deal at the weekend. It marked  a return to English football for Awoniyi, who began his professional career with Liverpool.

With his skill, pace, and confidence, he could prove to be a snip, even at £17.5million,” he added. Awoniyi enjoyed a fine 2021/22 campaign in Germany, attracting plenty of interest as he netted 20 goals in 43 appearances in all competitions. The Nigeria international had loan spells at FSV Frankfurt, NEC, Royal Excel Mouscron, Gent, Mainz 05, and Union Berlin during his time at Anfield, joining the latter permanently last July.
