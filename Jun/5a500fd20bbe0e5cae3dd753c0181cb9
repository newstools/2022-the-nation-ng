Singer Peter Okoye of PSquare aka Mr P, has told students to slam the pastor who prophesied the Academic Staff Union of University (ASUU) would call off its industrial strike on June 17. A TikTok video of a pastor prophesying the ASUU strike would end on Friday surfaced on the internet. “By this 17th of June, ASUU is calling off the strike,”bhe declared with his congregation thundering, “Amen!” Taking to his Instagram page to share the video, the Okoye twin noted the pastor would be dragged to filth because his prophecy has not been fulfilled. “Today is 17th of June!… This Pastor go collect Premium Dragging today! #OBIdients NOTE: This page does not support violence. DELETING SOON!” Mr P captioned the video. Fans expressed several opinions surprisingly with only few criticising him but in a hilarious manner.
