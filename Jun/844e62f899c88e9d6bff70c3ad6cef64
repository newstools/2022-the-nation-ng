Speaking during a listening party organised by The Listening Room, Falz noted that his new album is a picture of evolution as an artist.   Mr Eazi documents lead single off debut album     BBNAIJA’S ALEX: My man must be taller than me     I don’t sing for money but to win souls –Awolumate   “As an artist, I’ve evolved. I have moved into an updated version. This album is a product of a realm that I have not really explored. The album is an album where I am being emotional, vulnerable and at the same time, I’m being sexy. This is an album where I had to really sing, unlike others where I had to rap. If you think it is who you know, Falz as you would be met with something very different. I’m at a point where I want to be more and more experimental with my sounds. This is what you have in ‘Bahd’. The 12-tracks album has popular music producer Sars, Dr. Sid, Timaya, BoySpyce, and others as collaborators. Among others who attended the listening event were Tobi Bakare, Broda Shaggi, Mr Macaroni, Alex Unusual, and a host of others.
