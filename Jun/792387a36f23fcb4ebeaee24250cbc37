The CEO of Fashions Finest Africa and Founder of the event, Sola Oyebade stated that “the aim of Fashions Finest Africa and Epic Show is to bridge the gap between New and emerging fashion entrepreneurs and their dreams and aspirations in the industry, essentially empowering them to succeed in this fast-growing industry that has the ability to be the highest-grossing industry in the world”. He further explained that “most new and emerging fashion entrepreneurs, whether they are designers, leather wear manufacturers, make-up artists, hairstylists, influences or even fashion show producers in most cases have no access to the right knowledge, financing or platform to showcase their craft and gain visibility as the options available are usually too expensive or too high end for them, hence the reason why the Epic Show was created, to provide a safe haven that allows these entrepreneurs to gain first-hand knowledge and improve their craft while also promoting commerce.”
