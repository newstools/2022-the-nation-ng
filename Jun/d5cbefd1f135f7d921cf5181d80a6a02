Manchester United attacker Cristiano Ronaldo has insisted that he remains “very happy” at the club following a difficult 2021-22 season. The five-time Ballon d’Or winner snubbed interest from Manchester City to return to Old Trafford and enjoyed a strong campaign at a personal level for the Red Devils. Ronaldo scored 24 goals and set up three more in 38 appearances across all competitions, including 18 strikes from 30 outings in the Premier League. However, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick could only lead Man United to a sixth-placed finish in the top flight, as Erik ten Hag prepares to lead the club into the Europa League. Ronaldo’s future has inevitably been called into question following the Red Devils’ struggles, but Ten Hag recently affirmed that he was keen to begin working with the Portugal international.

Of course I would like to keep him. He’s been very important to Manchester United this year and can produce great statistics.” Now, Ronaldo has seemingly confirmed that he will not push for a move away from the club during an interview with the Red Devils, saying: “I was happy of course to be back at a club that really raised my career. So it was unbelievable. “The feeling when I (came) back again, it was nice to feel the supporters.” The happiness of them as great. I was – and still am – very happy to be here.   “I believe that Manchester will be where they belong. As I say before, sometimes it takes time but I still believe. The records are coming in a natural way. I don’t follow the records but the records follow me. So it’s good.
