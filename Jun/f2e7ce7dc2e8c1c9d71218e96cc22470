Sising singer Oyetundu Omolade aka Ladé has said her hit song ‘Adulthood Na Scam’ is an intentional and personal song. The singer made this known to The Nation in an exclusive chat recently saying “It was intentional and personal because that’s the stage I am in right now for the fact that I have to do things myself, cater for myself and make things happen for myself and I believe that a lot of youths right now that’s what they are trying to do.”   There are no roles that I cannot accept, Chioma Blessing     Jaiye Kuti opens up on role in Ile Alayo series     Gbenga Adeyinka 1st, Derenle Edun, Iyabo Ojo billed for…   Continuing, she said, “adulthood na scam because you know nobody gave us heads up that this is how it is going to be because we had our parents that will do stuff for us and go all the way to So, we had our parents that made things happen for us but now that we have to do all of those things ourselves, so it’s like a big weight on the youths.” Ladé who hails from Kwara state also said she didn’t expect the song to command so much acceptance in a short time. “I did not expect it to blow up like this, it was just me doing my thing, in my own element doing my music, I did not expect it will blow up this fast but I thank God for that.” The singer is popular for her rendition of the airtel ‘444 jingle’. She also disclosed how her cover of Simi’s hit single ‘Duduke’ sold her to advertising agencies that secured her the Airtel jingle.
