These leaders took millions of naira from all of these aspirants with promises to deliver the votes of a particular group of delegates to them on Election Day, but failed to do so. It has even been discovered that rather than share the money they collected to the delegates, these party leaders pocketed the money and watched the aspirants lose at the primary election,” a source explained. Upon realizing they had all been swindled by these party leaders who themselves were delegates at the election, the aspirants resolved to get their monies back from the politicians by hook or crook. Consequently, they have reported the concerned party chieftains to security agencies. “The police have promised to wade into the matter soon and ensure justice is done,” the source said.
