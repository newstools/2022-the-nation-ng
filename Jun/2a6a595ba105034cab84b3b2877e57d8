The news of how youths from different parts of Port Harcourt truncated the planned arrest of the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Rivers State, Siminialayi Fubara, by operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) last Tuesday, is still trending. The drama took place at the International Airport as the plane that brought Fubara and other PDP chieftains who had accompanied him to Abuja to receive his certificate of return touched down. Eye witness accounts claimed that as the operatives moved to accost him, youths described as political thugs by some commentators, fiercely resisted the officials.   2023, Southeast and self-marginalisation     APC sticks to Otu as governorship candidate in Cross River      Ngige seeks foreign support for Nigeria to achieve SDGs   Fubara, former Accountant General of the state and three other top government officials had been declared wanted by the EFCC over alleged N117 billion fraud.
