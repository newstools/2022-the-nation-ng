The Falconets have qualified for the 2022 U-17 World Cup after being held to a goalless draw in Abuja. The Ethiopians who lost 1-0 to Nigeria in Addis Ababa a fortnight ago held off for the entire duration of the game and frustrated the Nigerian team. Omowunmi Bello came close to opening the floodgates in the 13th minute but the Ethiopian goalie, Abeba continued from where she stopped two weeks ago by pulling a top-class save. She stood resolute between the sticks for large spells in the game and was the major difference between both teams.

She was however alert to gather the ball and save a potentially dangerous rebound. The Nigerians pushed for a winner all game but were kept out by the impressive Ethiopian defense. Ajakaye came close to scoring again in the 54th minute but was denied by the impressive Abeba. Kabede also proved a threat to the Nigerian defense as she attempted to score again with Omilana proving a stumbling block. Yetunde Ayantosho was subbed on for Alvine Dah Zossu on the hour mark and the team kept the game like that to book a place in India. The girls didn’t concede a goal in six games and scored 15. They didn’t lose any match also.
