Rangers of Scotland defender Calvin Bassey has admitted that playing for the national senior team – Super Eagles remains the biggest highlight of his career. Bassey who has made six appearances for Nigeria after making his debut during the 2022 World Cup qualifiers against Ghana on March 25, described his call-up to the Super Eagles as a dream comes true. “I was shocked and I could not believe it as I just felt so privileged and blessed to be invited to the Super Eagles squad. I thank God every day for this and I felt blessed to represent my great nation,” the 22-year-old said. “Playing for Nigeria, I don’t think I can really put it into words how I felt having 200m people behind our back wherever we are playing. “ Also being part of the 25 players representing over 200m people in a competitive match; I just want to help the team in any way I can,” he added, describing his omission from the 2022 AFCON as a wake-up call.
