The report claimed  that Phil Jones, Eric Bailly, Axel Tuanzebe and Teden Mengi could leave, while Victor Lindelof could yet be surplus to requirements at Old Trafford. Jones only made five appearances in all competitions last season; the 30-year-old still has another year left to run on his deal, though, and his large wage packet will make it difficult for clubs to afford him. Bailly only played seven times in all competitions last term, meanwhile, and the Ivory Coast international is said to be keen to depart in search of regular action.
