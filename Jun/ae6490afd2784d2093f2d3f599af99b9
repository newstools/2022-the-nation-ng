Multiple award-winning comedian Gbenga Adeyinka has threatened to report Instagram pages of bullies over his choice of presidential candidate in the forthcoming presidential poll. The presenter, who has declared his support for the flagbtearer of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, shared series of congratulatory posts following his victory at the just concluded convention. In one of the posts captioned “Victory party loading,” he requested everyone interested to join in “Asiwaju Victory Party’ slated for 8pm, Wednesday. Adeyinka attracted trolls who he told should unfollow him for his choice of presidential candidate. The 54-year-old ‘Grand Comedian of Nigeria’ argued like everyone else, he has the prerogative to support any presidential candidate. He wrote: “Dear follower. This is for you. I’m so tired of people coming to my page to curse me out over my choices.

Choose to support anybody you want in the coming elections and leave me to my choice. “Please note, I don’t have to follow you and you don’t have to follow me. I appreciate your follow but you have no right TO BULLY ME COS I DONT SUPPORT WHO YOU ARE SUPPORTING. Adeyinka added: “It’s not a crime for you to have a choice just as it isn’t for me too to have a choice. “People are just incredible. You go to peoples pages to bully them over their choices when you have taken a hand on yours. “We don’t have to agree on who to support. I have a right to choose like you have a right too. “Please, unfollow me if my choice is not ok with you.
