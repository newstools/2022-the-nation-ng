Actress Wofai Ewa aka Wofaifada has alleged men fight to keep the female child away from school for a reason. The media personality in an insta story post said men do so because they’re fully aware of the power of education. She claimed men try everything possible to keep females from staying in school because if they’re educated, they’re capable of achieving so much more than them (men).
