Inter Miami president David Beckham took advantage of Arturo Vidal’s summer holiday plans to try to sign the Chilean and bring him to MLS. It will, however, be tough to win the race for the midfielder, as he is wanted by several teams from within and out of Europe. Vidal, 35, was in Florida to take part in the A Beautiful Game match, which was organised by Roberto Carlos and Ronaldinho. Beckham took the opportunity to open talks with Vidal.

Beckham is offering Vidal, a champion in three of Europe’s top leagues, Spain (Barcelona), Germany (Bayern Munich) and Italy (Juventus and Inter), a contract worth approximately four million dollars per season. Vidal may ask for a higher salary to try to match or surpass that earned by Argentine Gonzalo Higuain who is the highest-paid player in the team at 5.1 million dollars, but that figure could reach 5.7 million with bonuses
