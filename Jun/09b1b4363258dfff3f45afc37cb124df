After all we all serve the same God, I believe. “I was stunned at how insensitive humans could get just to score religion points which can simply be considered as blasphemy. “I personally would like to use this medium to debunk such a false narrative. Never was there a time that I attended a church for healing. The picture circulating online is not me and I want everyone to please disregard it. “I have a personal relationship with Allah, I don’t need anyone to get through to him,” she wrote.
