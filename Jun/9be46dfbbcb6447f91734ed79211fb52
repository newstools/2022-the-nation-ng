Popular movie star Emeka Ike has said the days men engage in domestic violence against women were long gone. According to Ike, women have taken over the baton as they now abuse men domestically more than ever before yet they do so unrecognized because of their ‘manipulative edge’ . The A-list actor argued most women now go into marriages devoid of love in their hearts, just for the money and would go to any length to achieve their aim by making their husbands lives miserable or even killing them. The 55-year-old media personality further revealed he was a victim of domestic abuse and was only saved by God else he would have died as is the case of most men dying before their wives in marriages, he opined.   2023: Lady dumps boyfriend for not supporting Obi     #EkitiDecides2022: Ini Edo mobilises women to vote     Portable calls out Burna Boy over alleged intellectual theft   “Please, please, do your research well. Most women abuse men more lately. Most of them marry you for your money and make your life miserable, if not kill you. “Why are kidnappers and armed robbers wives not crying out? Why must it be very rich and successful men lately?” He continued: “Violent men are in the cover while this “kill and get rich” model spreads unrecognized. Not saying there are no dead beat men but the increase on the other gender manipulative edge is totally ignored. “Why do men have to die before women in marriage? Ask your father. Ask your grandfather. That’s if they are still alive to tell you things. “Please, please, let’s stop encouraging these wicked misleading and greedy women with this mundane top. Na God save me.”
