David Adeyemi has launched a book on music entitled Music Promotion: A Guide To Hacking The Damn Thing. According to Adeyemi, the book sheds more light on what it means to market, advertise, publicise and ‘do PR’. The book also highlights artists who have hacked the PR part of their careers with the likes of Adekunle Gold, Ruger, Yemi Alade, and Blaqbonez amongst others.   Durella: How MoHits tried preventing me from shinning     Hard work stands me out among colleagues, says Oja     Esther Igbekele to embark on U.S. tour   The launch, which took place at the BWC Hotel, Victoria Island, saw a fine array of guests attending the event-themed ‘Hacking Music Promotion’. Panelists were present to take the audience through a worthy and explanatory session with Dolapo Amusat, Wale Ozolua, Dapo Ayo-Adeusi, and Mira Udoh kickstarting the discussion on ‘How to hack music pr and promotion’. While giving his vote of thanks, Adeyemi explained the difference between PR and publicity, he said “It is a very thin line between PR and Publicity. While the latter is project-specific and bound, the former gives a wider angle as to how artists are perceived by fans. Publicity is not a replacement for PR.”
