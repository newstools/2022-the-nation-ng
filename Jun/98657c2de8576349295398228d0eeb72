Is it that you were told of they are saying it? “I don’t have time for negativities. I don’t just have time for that. If you face me with positives, I have time for all of that. I will stand here and answer all of your questions. “I cannot respond to every speculation, particularly when they are negative, especially when they are by mischief makers. “Is there any law that says when you contest an election and lost, you shouldn’t contest another one?” “Go and find out from the person who is responsible for organising the primary.
