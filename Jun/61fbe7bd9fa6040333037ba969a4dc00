Napoli are mentally preparing themselves to lose Nigerian youngster Victor Osimhen, given the rise in his value over the course of the recently concluded season. The 23-year-old striker is valued no less than €100M by the Partenopei, and amid heightened interest from Premier League giants Arsenal and Manchester United, he himself admitted to the fact that ‘anything can happen’ regarding his future. Milan’s presence has also spiced up proceedings regarding Osimhen. Osimhen has been consistently touted with a potential move away from the south of Italy, and Napoli are not lagging behind in shortlisting suitors to succeed the Nigerian.

On the other hand, Chelsea’s Albanian forward Armando Broja is also being closely followed. However, it is understood that with Romelu Lukaku now forcing his way back to Inter, the Blues would want to include Broja in their first team plans under Thomas Tuchel next Premier League season. For the two strikers, the lure of Champions League football next season will be hard to turn down. Despite their desire to cut down costs, Napoli would have plenty of ammunition if they sold Osimhen and could be able to meet the requests.
