There were fears of a reprisal yesterday following the murder of a member of All Progressives Congress (APC), Tope Ajayi, in Ekiti State. Ajayi, a member of the Road Transport Employer Association of Nigeria (RTEAN), was allegedly shot in Itaji-Ekiti by political thugs when the APC and Social Democratic Party (SDP) clashed during their campaigns. Sequel to Ajayi’s death, there was tension yesterday in Ado-Ekiti following rumours that the RTEAN had mobilised to launch a reprisal. The development forced many people to stay away from churches and mosques, and their residential buildings locked.
