Arsenal have completed the £30 million signing of Porto midfielder Fabio Vieira, it has been confirmed. The Portuguese midfielder had not been linked with a move to the Gunners throughout the start of the off-season, only to emerge as a surprise target for Mikel Arteta following previous links to other European giants. The 22-year-old will head to the Emirates Stadium for the next half-decade in a deal that could well come to be viewed as a cut-price bargain buy for the north London outfit, given his potential pedigree.
