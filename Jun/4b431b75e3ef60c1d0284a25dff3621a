Maverick showbiz man Charly Boy has shared the implication of the presidential bid of former Anambra Governor Peter Obi. Obi, who dumped the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for Labour Party (LP), on whose platform he would contest the 2023 presidency, has attracted a large followership on social media that voraciously displays support for his candidature. Seeing the play of events by the Labour Party’s presidential candidate supporters, the 72-year-old entertainer argued Obi’s presence has activated something unusual in the political history of Nigeria.
