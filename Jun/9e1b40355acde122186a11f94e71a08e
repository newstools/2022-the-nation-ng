Osun State Governor Adegboyega Oyetola has urged the people of Ekiti State to vote the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its governorship candidate, Biodun Oyebanji, on Saturday. “You don’t change a winning party,” he said. Oyetola led a delegation comprising Deputy Governor Gboyega Alabi, SSG Prince Wole Oyebanji, Chief of Staff Charles Akinola and others to Ado-Ekiti for the grand finale of the APC governorship campaign rallies yesterday.

So, once we have APC again, all these will continue in Ekiti. “We can all see and feel the infrastructure development in Ekiti and other laudable projects, all of which are executed to secure the future for generations yet unborn in Ekiti State. And because it is trite that you don’t change a winning party, I urge the voters to ensure our party’s resounding victory at the poll, come this Saturday,” he added.
