Henry Onyekuru has moved a big step closer to a return to the Turkish Super Lig after he agreed personal terms with Besiktas. The transfer will now be completed when the Turkish giants agree a transfer fee with Greek champions Olympiacos, according to Fotomac. Onyekuru enjoyed some of his best career highlights with another Turkish club, Galatasaray, where he thrice featured on loan. Olympiacos bought Onyekuru last summer for 4.5 Million Euros from Ligue 1 side AS Monaco. He made 27 appearances and scored a goal for the Greek giants.

Last season, Ugbo played in the second part of the campaign on loan with French Ligue 1 side Troyes from Genk. The 23-year-old striker, who could not break into the Chelsea main team, scored 11 goals in 39 appearances last season. He also opted to play for 2022 World Cup-bound Canada even though he is also eligible to play for Nigeria or England. Ugbo is not guaranteed first-team football at Belgian club Genk as Super Eagles striker Paul Onuachu has yet to make the expected big move, while Cyriel Dessers has returned from loan at Dutch club Feyenoord
