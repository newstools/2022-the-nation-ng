Glasgow Rangers are reportedly mulling over a move for Nigeria international Stephen Odey. According to report, preliminary discussions have been held with sporting director Ross Wilson, and Odey is seriously being considered as a potential transfer option this summer. The former Mountain of Fire (MFM) striker has put himself in the shop window on the back of his form for Danish Superliga club Randers last season.

Randers are demanding a fee of around £4m from clubs interested in Odey and recently rejected a bid of three million euros plus add-ons from an unnamed Belgian Pro League club. The interest from Rangers is said to be firmer with Gio van Bronckhorst identifying Odey as one of the attacking targets in the event Alfredo Morelos departs Ibrox.
