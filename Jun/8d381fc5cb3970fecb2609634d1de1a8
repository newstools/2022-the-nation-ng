Singers Kizz Daniel and Davido have excited many fans with their recent announcement of an upcoming joint EP. An extended play record usually referred to as an EP is a musical recording that contains more tracks than a single but fewer than an album or LP (long play) record. Kizz Daniel, whose hit song, “Buga” has continued to gain local and global acceptance since its release informed fans that he has a joint EP with Davido, which is almost ready. The father of two tweeted a 25-second ‘soundless’ video chat with Davido at the airport accompanied with words that reads: “We have an EP COMING BRA @davido where you at ?! Responding, the DMW boss confirmed their joint EP and reassured music lovers that they will overdose on their good music. “Who’s ready !!!!!! ??? OBO X KIZZ EP?
