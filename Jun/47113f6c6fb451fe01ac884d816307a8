A very close source to the Governor confirmed the latest development to The Nation in Abakaliki. The source, who pleaded for anonymity dismissed, the speculations that a fresh primary election was held for the senatorial district. He said: “No election was rescheduled, what happened was just substitution of candidates. The Electoral Act directs that such exercise must be conducted at the venue where the earlier exercise took place with full agreement of all parties involved. ”The Governor does not need to be present for the exercise to take place. All that is required is just the consent of parties involved and once they agree and sign necessary documents the exercise is complete. Then, the party submits to INEC and case closes”.
