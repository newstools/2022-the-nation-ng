NIGERIA’S Tobi Amusan captured a second gold in the Women’s 4x100m relay at the African Athletics Championships in Mauritius. Amusan, who won the 100m hurdles title on Thursday, ran the final leg to help Nigeria win the women’s 4x100m relays, as her team bounced back from only qualifying for the final as the fastest loser. The silver medal went to South Africa while The Gambia, anchored home by 100m champion Gina Bass, claimed a first-ever relay medal at a major championship for the West African nation. The win means that Amusan, who holds the African record of the 100m hurdles, matches her feat from four years ago when she won the same two golds on home soil.

Despite finishing eleven seconds behind the winner Kigen was philosophical after the race. “Championship racing Is like a merry-go-round, today you are a winner – tomorrow you don’t know what will happen,” he told BBC Sport Africa. “Our dominance was another generation and now others keep acquiring skills from training and they are now used to how Kenyans compete and that is why they are running fast. “Now it’s a matter of us working hard on it so that you can fight back.”
