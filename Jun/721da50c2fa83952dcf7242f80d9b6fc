We started last year with the establishment of this platform in Federal Government Girls Collage, Abuja and early this year we got approval from the Federal Ministry of Education to establish this same platform in the 110 unity schools. We are starting with the unity schools before we gradually move into Government schools. “This is a platform for young people to educate themselves and peers on the ills of trafficking in persons and violence against persons.” “When we talk about violence against persons, people automatically think it just has to do with women? That is why the act is intentional by calling it violence against persons and not women. It also covers men. “How many men know that if your wife or girlfriend destroys your TV or property due to a quarrel, it is a crime and it is punishable by two years? How many women know that when someone consistently calls you stupid, it says you are worthless or an idiot and it is a crime? It is called emotional abuse. We already have a law that protects us against all these things and penalises all the actions but you will not know that unless you know the content of that law.”
