I first shot him in the leg with AK47, while my colleague shot him in the armpit; that was actually the shot that killed him.” On how the victim died, Kanu said, “While UD and I were with the victim in the forest, the man tried to dispossess me of my AK47 rifle. My colleague UD hacked him down because he was bulky and masculine. He attacked UD and ran off in an attempt to escape. “We went after him and UD caught him. He tried to strangle UD. To save my colleague, I shot him in the leg, he quickly left UD, it was then UD out of anger shot him again around the armpit area and he died.” The teenager pleaded for mercy, pledging to turn a new leaf if granted pardon. The CP said at least 30 suspects involved in various crimes were arrested while 17 arms and ammunition were recovered, seven kidnapped victims and a child rescued between May 1 and June 15, 2022.
