An activist, Adesunbo Onitiri has blamed ex-military men turned politicians for being responsible for Nigeria’s 23 years of retarded democracy. In a press statement issued in Lagos, Onitiri said that politicians have learnt nothing and forgotten nothing. He said:  “Surely this is not the democracy we fought for. This democracy has been badly bastardised and monetised. “Our struggle to actualize June 12 by sending the military back to the barracks was hijacked by the military adventurists who dropped their khaki uniforms and dramatically changed to agbada.”   Shun unholy acts, Abiodun cautions Ogun Muslim pilgrims     Lions Club holds medical outreach     Sanwo-Olu kicks off construction of Falomo Towers   Onitiri recalled that when the symbol and martyr of the June 12 struggles, Chief MKO Abiola was incarcerated and died, a retired army general took over to midwife Nigeria’s democracy. “What do you expect from an ex-military man trained to kill and destroy, but elected to midwife democracy? What you don’t have you cannot give,” he stressed. “As if that was not enough, another ex-military chief became the Senate president for many years. What do you expect from such a formation? Our democracy was totally disillusioned and turned into something else. “Those of us that struggled and suffered for democracy were completely annihilated and sidelined.”
