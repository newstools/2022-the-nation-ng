The massacre of innocent worshippers at St. Francis Catholic Church in Owo, Ondo State, is a call to all good people of Southwest Nigeria and Nigeria as a whole to wake up from their slumber and pay more attention to security, the Onisabe of Igbobi-Sabe, Lagos Mainland, Oba Owolabi Adeyemi Adeniyi has said. About 40 worshippers were killed in the attack. “When you have a problem like this in the Western world, it is not the business of the police alone. They combine all forces to face the threat. So I am appealing to our government because the usual trend is for the people to blame the obas and other traditional rulers and call us all sorts of names. They even curse us and accuse us of being compromised. But you cannot blame them, because they are talking out of pain. And that is why I am speaking up. Perhaps if every Oba and traditional ruler speaks up, things can change. Like you know, Obas don’t have any serious power; we only console ourselves when we say that we are all government because the truth is we are not.”   Kaduna confirms 32 killed, denies helicopter attack     140 suspected Yahoo Boys arrested at two Lagos hotels     Forensic probe links Naira Marley with Visa card fraud   “If we keep quiet, it is even more dangerous. Since that incident, I have not been myself. I even shed tears after seeing a graphic picture of what happened.” He dismissed the notion that the Owo attack was the first of its kind in the Southwest, recalling the attack on Igangan in Ibarapa, Oke-Ogun, Oyo State in 2021, where 50 people were reportedly massacred. Oba Adeniyi also pledged to rally and galvanise Obas in the Lagos State Council of Obas to take up the issue.
