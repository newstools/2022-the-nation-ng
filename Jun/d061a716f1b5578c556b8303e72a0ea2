Mr Ekweremadu is a member of the Senate in Nigeria. “‘He has previously held an even more senior role as deputy president of the senate. “‘He is a member of the bar in Nigeria. He is a principal in a law firm that bears his name. “’Those issues taken together go way beyond him being a person of good character…rather that he has led a blameless life as a public servant.’ “Mr Irwin added that the allegations were ‘nothing short of preposterous’. “Antonia Gray, for Mrs. Ekweremadu, said: ‘She has never been complicit or involved in any alleged illegal trafficking of any young person. ‘She is a financial accountant with an unblemished record.’”
