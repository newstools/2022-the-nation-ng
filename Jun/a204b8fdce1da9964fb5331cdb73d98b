The Clintonel Innovation Centre (CIC) has inaugurated the N1 million Engineering Research Grant to bridge the engineering skills gap, facilitate industry-academia collaborations and drive industrialisation. Its founder Tochukwu Chukwueke said the grant was to support engineering lecturers in tertiary institutions (uto develop solutions for industries. In addition, he said, successful applicants would have access to experts and facilities at the Clintonel Advanced Engineering Centre (AEC), Aba for developing their solutions. Chukwueke, an advocate of increased universities and industry collaboration, said this would enable Nigeria increase its share of the global engineering services market, expected to hit $1071.59 billion this year. The market is expected to reach $1383.41 billion in 2026, according to Reportlinker.com. The services market include civil, environmental, mechanical engineering.

With a science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) skill shortage in various parts of the world, Chukwueke noted that the need for more engineering graduates was on the rise to fill these gaps. Given this growing skills gap, he stressed, aspiring engineers must harness their skillsets, for employers. Chukwueke said his goal is to get more students to explore job opportunities in civil, computer, electrical, mechanical, software and space engineering. For this reason, he wants post-secondary infrastructure improved as part of the government’s plan to grow the economy and create jobs.
