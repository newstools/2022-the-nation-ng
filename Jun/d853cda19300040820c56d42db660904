I was not worried about running fast, I just wanted to get a clear race to get the win and I broke the African record so it was kind of shocking,” he said. She  dedicated her victory to her mother who was present to cheer her to victory: “I am dedicating the victory to my mum because I had to drag her here because she is always nervous watching me run. “Definitely, her presence here gave me a kind of motivation. She has been my pillar of support and I cannot do anything without her support without her I would not have been where I am today and this is the first time she was watching me run.” Speaking ahead of the forthcoming  Commonwealth Games, she said: “Mentally I am in a good space going into my second Commonwealth Games and trusting in the process and execution as well.”
