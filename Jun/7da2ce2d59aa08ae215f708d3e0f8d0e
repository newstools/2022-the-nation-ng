The Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC), has called on stakeholders to intensify efforts to address abject energy poverty in Africa. The GMD/CEO of NNPC, Malam Mele Kyari, made the call during an Oil and Gas summit held in Abuja recently. At a panel session on Energy Transition at the summit organised by the Africa Finance Corporation (AFC) with the theme: Africa’s Energy Conundrum: A Pragmatic Approach to Net Zero, Kyari joined other energy experts to advocate for a concrete approach to energy transition to guarantee cheap access to energy in Africa. According to him, there should be a slow but proper energy transition process in Africa with emphasis on access rather than net zero status.

He said NNPC was at the forefront of efforts by Nigeria to rally the needed support and cooperation among African countries to promote gas sufficiency in order to eliminate energy poverty. The GMD also drummed up support for the integration of Africa’s infrastructure in the region. According to the panelists, there is need for African countries to reduce their dependence on foreign funds for projects and start looking inwards for financing. They spoke on the need for effective communication strategy during the campaigns with the African populace and the transition process just as they said that energy poverty needed to be addressed. Meanwhile, the NNPC Ltd has reiterated its commitment to ensuring that Nigeria enjoyed energy security, especially in the area of petroleum products availability.
