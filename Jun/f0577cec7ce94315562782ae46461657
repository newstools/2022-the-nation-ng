Super Eagles forward Moses Simon, who has variously been linked with a transfer to the Premier League, has agreed personal terms with Ligue 1 club OGC Nice. His club FC Nantes have already said they will not stand in the way of the winger should they receive an “interesting” offer for him. Nice have agreed terms with the 26-year-old, who has been given the green light for a move away from this year’s Coupe de France winners, where the winger hit eight assists – only bested by six players – and he added six goals last season.

Premier League side Leeds United, however, are also following Simon, who was the Super Eagles stand-in captain in their emphatic 10-0 demolition of The Falcons and True Parrots of São Tomé and Príncipe earlier in the month in Morocco. In yesterday’s press conference, Nantes president Waldemar Kita announced that Simon was among a group of players who would be allowed to leave. On a potential departure for Simon, Albon Lafont and Ludovic Blas, Kita said, “We would be delighted if they stayed, but if there are interesting offers, we would have to think about them. Are there any offers? That’s part of the backstage business of the transfer market; I can’t talk too much about it. I can just say that those players are here now.”
