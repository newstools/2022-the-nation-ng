The proposed policy tagged National Strategic Policy for LPG had a five-year timeline to tactically phase out kerosene usage in the country. However, in a statement issued by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu on Friday, President Buhari informed the international community that Nigeria had submitted an updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, to replace the interim contribution of May 27, 2021.
