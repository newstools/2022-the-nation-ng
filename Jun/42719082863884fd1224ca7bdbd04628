A social media influencer and member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Meinyie Crackcommander, has escaped assassination in Port Harcourt, Rivers State. It was gathered that four masked men bearing AK-47 rifles stormed his compound at about 3am on Thursday and went straight to his apartment. Meinyie confirmed the incident and said the gunmen made efforts to enter his room unknown to them that he was not at home. He said: “Gunmen in the early hours of today attacked my house. They were four in number, one girl and three boys all masked with AK-47 riffles.

My housemaid barely escaped and they threatened to shoot my wife if she wouldn’t open the door. This lasted for a while until my landlord made frantic efforts to alert neighbors and OSPACc and they fled”. Meinyie said the gunmen only entered his apartment and made it clear that they were after his life. He said his wife had reported the matter to the police and pointed accusing fingers on a local government chairman. He disclosed that the chairman had threatened to deal with him following a post he made on his Facebook wall. He said despite the intervention of a leader of the APC in the State, the council boss reiterated the threats that he would “put an end to this”. Meinyie said the chairman accused him of constantly trolling him insisting that he would permanently stop him.
