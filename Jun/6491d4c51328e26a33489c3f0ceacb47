A Makurdi Chief Magistrates’ Court on Friday remanded a 40-year-old farmer, Teryila Akperakya, in a correction centre for allegedly abducting his own daughter. Akperakya, who lives at Ukan Mbaded village in Ushongo Local Government Area of Benue was charged with Criminal Breach of Trust and Abduction. However, the Magistrate, Mr Vincent Kor, did not take the plea of Akperakya for want in jurisdiction. Kor adjourned the matter until Aug. 1 for further mention. Earlier, the Prosecution Counsel, Insp Jonah Uletu told the court that Mrs Rachel Ukpo reported the matter at the state Criminal and Investigation Department, Makurdi on June 10.
