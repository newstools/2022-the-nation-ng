The governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for 2023 election in Adamawa State, Ahmadu Fintiri who is also the incumbent governor, has chosen a female Vice-chancellor as his running mate. It was confirmed Thursday afternoon that Fintiri chose the Vice-Chancellor of Adamawa State University (ADSU), Mubi, Professor Kaletapwa Farauta. Mr Solomon Kumangar, the Director General of Media and Communications to Governor Fintiri confirmed the development to newsmen, saying he had got the news firsthand from Fintiri. Until now Professor Kaletapwa had been the Vice-Chancellor of ADSU since February 2020. Farauta from Numan, hails from the same southern zone of Adamawa State as Crowther Seth who hails from Lamurde.

She was a lecturer at the Modibbo Adama University (MAU), Yola. Farauta who was born on November 28, 1965 in Numan, Southern Adamawa, is married with children. Farauta’s choice as Fintiri’s running mate came as a surprise to most Adamawa people, including those close to Fintiri’s government, as the governor appeared to have kept it close to his chest. The choice ends the road for Chief Crowther Seth, the present deputy governor of Adamawa State whose fate was little known until the breaking of the news about Farauta.
