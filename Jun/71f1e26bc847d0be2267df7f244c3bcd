According to him, career lectures will also be delivered to pupils of selected schools in Port Harcourt, Lagos and Kano to arouse their interest in hydrography. Okafor explained that by so doing, the nation would get more experts to provide quality service for their fatherland. Aside the lectures, he said there would be a plenary session on June 21 for professionals and government officials to deliberate on how best to use the science of hydrography to improve the health of Nigeria’s ocean for sustainable development.
