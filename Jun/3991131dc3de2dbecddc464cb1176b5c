Chairman of the organising committee for the 2022 Nigerian athletics championship, chief Solomon Ogba said  the event will be staged to match the rising profile of track and field in Nigeria. A number of Nigerian athletes have  recently attained world class status and Ogba is confident the glory days are back for the sport. “We want to organise a championship befitting our rising profile because  I cannot remember the last time we produced three women who have gone inside 11 seconds in the 100m in one year or produce athletes that will break records as old as the athletes themselves,” Ogba, a two-time president of the AFN, said. Interestingly,  the trio of Favour Ofili (10.93), Rosemary Chukwuma (10.99) and Grace Nwokocha (10.97) have all ran sub-11 seconds this year while as many as five men including  Udodi Onwuzurike (10.03), Raymond Ekevwo (10.04), Favour Ashe (10.04), Alaba Akintola (10.04) and Ushoritse Itshekiri (10.09) have gone under 10.10 seconds.

The championship will hold between June 21 and  June 23 in Benin City,  the capital of Edo State and Ogba said the choice was strategic: “We have a good, world class track at the Samuel Ogbemudia stadium which  hosted the athletics event of last years’  Edo 2020 National Sports Festival .”
