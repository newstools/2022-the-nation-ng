I will deploy machines on Aba road and other streets to sweep the streets of PortHarcourt because I have discovered over time that the labourers had worked over time without better pay but with machines this  jobs can be effectively done and alterative source of income will be made to these workers. I have a master plan for this, I didn’t just come up with this. When I’m elected as Rivers governor, this is one of the things I will do first. Abednego also promised to prioritise the workd of pensioners and civil servants and creation of employment if elected governor. “I have observed very carefully on how our civil servants have been treated.
