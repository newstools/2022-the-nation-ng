Popular comedian Ime Bishop Umoh aka Okon Lagos has announced his vote is up for sell at a giveaway price. The comic act in a new video said he has no business with persons advocating against vote buying because his PVC belongs to him and he has decided he wants to sell his vote but at the right price. “You see all these don’t sell your votes….it doesn’t concern me because I have my PVC. So I will sell my vote. I will sell it but at the right price. A very considerate and generous price because of you. “You know most of these politicians that buy vote will just appear in your life once every four years. And come and buy your vote in the polling units and just disappear. And come again the next election year, after four years,” he said. He explained he’ll be selling his vote on per day basis multiplied by the number of days in four years.
