Controversial Nollywood actress and social media influencer, Tonto Dikeh, is now a politician and Sentry can authoritatively tell you that she is not starting small at all. As a matter of fact, she is the deputy governorship candidate of the African Democratic Congress (ADC) in the forthcoming 2023 general election in Rivers State. Tonte Ibraye, ADC governorship candidate in the state, reportedly called on Dikeh to come and join his ticket as his running mate after considering a lot of other options available to the party across the state. He announced Dikeh’s candidacy yesterday in a statement posted on his verified Facebook page.

This is for real, not just some Nollywood actress pretending to be a politician.
