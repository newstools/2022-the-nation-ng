Newly promoted English Premier League side Fulham are looking to offer Porto €12million (₦5.3billion) for the services of Super Eagles defender Zaidu Sanusi. Zaidu was brilliant for Porto last season scoring three goals in 40 appearances in all competitions. In fact, it was his whooping strike that guaranteed the Dragons a 30th Portuguese league triumph. However, the Nigerian star is not the most famous name in Porto, as occasionally the fans have trolled him. Last summer he was linked with a move to Turkey, but nothing concrete emerged from the talks.
