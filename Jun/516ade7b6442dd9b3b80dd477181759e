The Hydro-Electric Power Producing Areas Development Commission (HYPPADEC) has commenced implementation of some targeted projects in host communities to avert perennial flooding on the river banks. The commission also said it has started putting measures in place to address the growing insecurity in HYPPADEC states, especially in the North Central. Chairman of the Commission, Terfa Ityav, said this during the 6th Governing Council meeting of HYPPADEC yesterday in Abuja. Ityav said as part of efforts to curb insecurity in its host states, the commission had begun the lightening up of the communities as well as contributing towards arresting insecurity in the region. He noted that in line with the mandate of HYPPADEC, projects have been executed in all the six member states in the last 12 months.

The member-states of HYPPADEC include: Kebbi, Niger, Kwara, Kogi, Benue and Plateau. He said: “It is my belief that as we approach the second half of 2022, the commission has put in modalities as required by the government at achieving execution of more projects in the HYPPADEC states.” Managing Director, HYPPADEC, Sadiq Yelwa, noted that the commission had tried to make it a periodic exercise to sponsor flood warnings in various media in the affected states, especially on the radio and television and in local languages of the communities. He said the efforts have helped in averting flooding in the host communities.
