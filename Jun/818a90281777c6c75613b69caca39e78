Despite her robust financial muscle, Afrobeats diva Tiwa Savage has insisted she only wants to date a wealthy man. She has been in the news for a while especially since she commenced her “Water and Garri” tour on May 15 in the US. She has continued to set social media agog with energetic performances, dress styles, charisma and connection with fans, the females particularly. In several performances, the Afropop star thrilled fans with talks on the kind of man she desires. She said she needs someone who would match her energy with loads of money too. But noted she wasn’t all about the money because she’s ‘boxed-up’ too and equal to the task.

So all I’m saying is, you need to match my energy. Because, he will still break your heart, anyway. “So, it’s better for you to cry with your Christian Dior and your private jet to Dubai,” Savage said.
