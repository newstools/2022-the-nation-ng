Three communities in Ogun State panicked yesterday over a report that Boko Haram insurgents had invaded them. Some residents of Oba Oko, Oke-Ata and Rounda-Soyoye communities in Abeokuta, the state capital, rushed out of their homes and markets to withdraw their children from schools as the news of the invasion spread. Some made frantic phone calls to ascertain the safety of their family members. It was learnt that the residents heard that fleeing members of Boko Haram had stormed Rounda-Soyoye area and attacked a school there, killing some pupils.

Police also dismissed the rumour, saying the panic was unfounded. Spokesman Abimbola Oyeyemi said: “The attention of Ogun state police command has been drawn to a false alarm raised by some unknown persons in the early hours of today (yesterday) that some gunmen have invaded Obada Oko, Oke Ata and some parts of Abeokuta metropolis. “The alarmist went further to ask schools in those areas to close and send their pupils to their homes for safety. Having heard the false alarm, the commissioner of police, CP Lanre Bankole, quickly deployed some officers and men of the command to the area only to find out that nothing of such is happening anywhere around the mentioned places. “The command is therefore appealing to members of the public to discountenance the false information as nothing of such is happening anywhere in Ogun state, and our people should therefore go about their lawful businesses without the fear of any form of harassment or intimidation.”
