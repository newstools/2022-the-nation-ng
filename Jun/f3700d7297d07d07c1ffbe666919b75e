The 22-year-old becomes the first major new arrival at Emirates Stadium this summer, following young Brazilian winger Marquinhos – who joined from Sao Paulo last week for a £3m fee – and USA goalkeeper Matt Turner, who is due to arrive in the UK later this month after leaving New England Revolution in the MLS. Meanwhile, Arsenal are working on a deal for Manchester City striker Gabriel Jesus and are growing in confident that they can reach an agreement over the signing.
