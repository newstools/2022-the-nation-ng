Mane has signed a three-year contract at Bayern, tying him to the Bundesliga champions until the summer of 2025. Reports claim he is set to earn a salary of around € 15m a year, making him one of the highest earners at the Allianz Arena. Mane told his new club’s website: “I’m very happy to finally be with FC Bayern in Munich. We had a lot of talks and I felt the great interest of this big club from the start. So there was no doubt in my mind right from the start: this is the right time for this challenge.   Gunmen kill two kids, landlord in Delta     Three die in Abia community over protest     Court orders interim forfeiture of Dasuki son’s N90m…   “I want to achieve a lot with this club, also internationally. During my time in Salzburg I followed many FC Bayern games – I like this club very much!” Liverpool have gambled on Darwin Nunez and Luis Diaz to plug the gaps Mane will leave. Both have immense potential, and look well-suited to Klopp’s system, but both will have to be something special to replace the smiling, scoring Senegalese superstar. Goal
