Veteran Yoruba actor Taiwo Hassan aka Ogogo, has explained why he fought a fan on the streets of Ilaro, Ogun State. He was seen in a viral video in serious scuffle with an unidentified man surrounded by a crowd of people before entering his car and zooming off. Pressed to share his side of the story to avoid misinterpretation by bloggers, the actor shared videos of the incident on his Instagram page, explaining what prompted the brawl. He said: “I was in Ilaro, my own home town, for an inspection of a project, after which some unknown guys walked up to me for the normal appraisals. ‘We watch your movie’, ‘give up money, ‘We watched you all through our childhood’…All these as an actor we hear everyday.

I asked him to leave me, he said, ‘Do your worse’. The rest is story.” Seizing the opportunity, the 62-year-old entertainer reminded fans that he was once a boxer while he advised them to appreciate whatever they are given benevolently by celebrities without exhibiting the entitlement attitude. “Do you pay anyone for doing your job? No. It’s our job too. Accept all we offer when we do. Remember, once a boxer, always a boxer,” he added. The post caption reads: “Before bloggers pick this up, let me tell my side of the story and the truth.”
