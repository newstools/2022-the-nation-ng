The Lagos Waste Management Authority (LAWMA) has reassured residents of a clean environment despite the challenge of diesel scarcity. It also urged them to always bag their waste. Its Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Ibrahim Odumboni, stated this at the weekend while monitoring the environment. He added that efforts were being intensified to clear backlog of refuse, and to stop acts of indiscriminate waste disposal around the city. He said: “We have redoubled our efforts, working round the clock to ensure that we evacuate all waste anywhere around the city. Although the scarcity and high cost of diesel has been a major challenge, as service providers’ trucks run on diesel, nonetheless, we are doing the needful and leaving no stone unturned, to maintain a clean environment and prevent health hazard to the people. “Over preceding months, we have rolled out advocacy and media sensitisation campaigns, to inform and educate residents on the importance of environmental cleanliness, particularly the act of waste containerisation. We have also supported efforts of PSP operators, by providing backup services in areas that experienced service gaps, with the overall aim of eradicating black spots across the metropolis.” He urged residents to bag and containerise their waste to allow more storage period and prevent littering.

As we work day and night to make this happen, we urge you to support our efforts because the cleanliness of the state is a collective responsibility,” he said. Odumboni noted that despite the serious logistics challenges faced by PSP operators, as a result of the increase in the price of diesel, they had continued to provide services to tenements. He added that the authority, in order to ensure effective turnaround time of waste collection trucks, had ensured that landfills are in proper shape. “Before now, we had carried out massive rehabilitation work across our various landfills, to improve the turnaround time of PSP trucks servicing tenements and commercial facilities in the state. This has improved condition of the sites, paving way for seamless waste collection activities,” he stated.
