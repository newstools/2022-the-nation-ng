Bamidele charged Christian ministers to boost their spiritual life and rededicate themselves. He expressed optimism that Nigeria would get over the current security challenges as he prayed that the evil-doers would not escape the judgement of God, saying that evil people and their collaborators would soon be exposed and disgraced. Bamidele, therefore, recommended that youths and other citizens should be trained on counter-terrorism so that they can defend their localities against attackers.
