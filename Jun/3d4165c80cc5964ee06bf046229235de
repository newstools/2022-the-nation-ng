Popular comedian Mr Jollof has reacted to old videos where he criticised All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. The comic act said he was a blind boy when he shared the videos. He spoke against the background of criticism for his declaration of support for Tinubu in the 2023 presidential poll. His critics dug up the videos shot in 2020 where he slammed Tinubu who he is now backing. The humour merchant explained he was still a baby and blind when he expressed those views in 2020. According to him, he can see things clearly which is why he has chosen to support Tinubu.

He said: “Go and support your Atiku and Peter Obi. Leave me alone with my Asiwaju, leave me alone. Whatever I said about Asiwaju, I was blind; now I can see. “I was a baby then, I was a baby (making sounds like a crying baby). Now, I’m a man. I can decide what I want. I can see things the way they are. “I can’t just share things that are not appropriate. If you people are angry and bitter, channel it to the presidency. Don’t channel it to my candidate. “Tinubu na president? Abi Tinubu na governor? No be since 2007 naim finish comot for office? E hold any office again? What’s you people’s problem?! Go and support your candidate and leave him alone. “Whatever I said about him before, I was a baby.” “Election na competition go and sell your candidate !!! See you on Election Day. I am BATTIFIED,” he captioned the video.
