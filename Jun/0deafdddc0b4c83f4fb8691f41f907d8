Super Eagles winger Moses Simon said he considered it a big honour to wear the Super Eagles’ armband for the first time against Sao Tomé and Principe. Simon led the team to an emphatic win against the small island nation on Monday as Nigeria made history in Agadir. The Nantes winger started from where he stopped against Sierra Leone by assisting Victor Osimhen to head in the curtain raiser. He also grabbed the team’s second as he bundled home an Osimhen toe-poke assist and had a great evening overall.
