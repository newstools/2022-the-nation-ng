Speaking at the public presentation in Lagos, the Chairman, HEDA Resource Centre, Mr. Olanrewaju Suraju, explained that the first edition of the rating, published in August 2020, focused on assessing the Federal Government’s management of the COVID-19 pandemic from health, finance, disaster management and response and accountability perspectives.
