Owing to raging unemployment, youths in Adamawa State have been taught to unleash their inner resourcefulness for self-employment. The youths, who attended a business success inspirational talk shop in Yola by successful business tycoons, were urged never to despair in the face of daunting social and economic challenges but to release their power of imagination to achieve their dreams. The speakers, assembled by Naturessence International, which organized the X-Fest event, stressed that possibilities are unlimited to people who can muster a can-do- spirit. They noted though young people face difficult challenges, the constraints usually only provide impetus for pushing more to attain targeted heights as there is normally no sweet without sweat.
