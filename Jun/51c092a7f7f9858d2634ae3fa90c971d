SINGER, songwriter, music executive, and entrepreneur, Morenike Peter-Thomas has opined that not every music listener is a fan of mainstream music. Hembadoon as Peter-Thomas is fondly referred to said, “The messages in my songs contain a whole lot like empowerment for females, individualism as you as a person loving yourself, there is a lot of love, beauty, and life. I want to give people good music, and give them a chance to enjoy good music because not everybody is a fan of the mainstream. And there are people like us who serve them. I want to put this on a platter and everybody can eat as much as they want. I hope to do this as frequently as possible.”   Larry J: I’ll never attempt unethical jokes     Olubukola Bolarinde: Royalty meets music, art, fashion at…     Zinoleesky puts hope in God over Headies nomination   Recently Hembadoon wowed her family, friends, and well-wishers with an evening of good music and fun. Held at the Ikeja mall, Hembadoon dished out soul-inspiring songs to the delight of the gathering that graced the occasion powered by Heineken. Speaking at the event, she said, “My music is what you classify as world music generally because I dabble into a bit of everything and that is because music is experimental, I don’t want to restrict myself. The audience has a wide palate. I have an EP and I have a couple of singles that are out on every digital platform. I am also working on an album currently.”
