The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) says it will begin the second phase (Phase One) of the National Mass Metering Programme (NMMP) in August 2022. The electricity sector regulator also said it received bids from 45 local meter manufacturers to participate in the programme and was currently reviewing them. NERC Commissioner, Finance and Management Service, Nathan Shatti, made this known at an interactive session with newsmen after the Second Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry (NESI) meeting in Lagos. Recall that the Phase Zero of the NMMP was flagged off on October 30, 2020 with about 980,000 electricity customers installed with free prepaid meters under the first phase. Shatti said the procurement process for the second phase started in early 2022, adding that NERC was currently reviewing the capacity of the manufacturers.

From our experience in phase zero, we want to make sure that the manufacturers can deliver before allocation is made. I am sure that we will be able to finish the assessment by the end of this month and it will be finalised by the Procurement Implementation Unit. We are hoping that before the end of August, we will begin to see meters from our local manufacturers going to the electricity Distribution Companies and then to end-user customers,” Shatti said. The NMMP is aimed at meeting the target of closing the metering gap in the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry.
