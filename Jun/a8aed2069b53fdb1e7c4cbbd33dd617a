Super Eagles assistant coach Finidi George has said that the team is still in a rebuilding process, adding the players would live up to the expectations by the time they  file out for their  2023 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifier against Sierra Leone in Abuja on 9th June. The 51-year-old former international, who was recently appointed to assist Jose Peseiro, noted that  the former Venezuela and Saudi Arabia manager has done a good job so far within his short time as the national team head coach. The three-time African champions earned huge plaudits despite losing 2-1 to  El Tri of Mexico in Peseiro’s first game at  the  AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas on Sunday morning as they dominated the second half of the game, and were unlucky not to get at least a draw.

It’s been good so far. “He (Peseiro) has done well. It’s not easy, just a week with the players. He is letting them know what he wants from them, bit by bit. “By the time we get to the qualifications, I think the players will know what’s expected of them in the Super Eagles of Nigeria and try to do their best for the country,” the former Ajax  and  Real Betis winger added.
