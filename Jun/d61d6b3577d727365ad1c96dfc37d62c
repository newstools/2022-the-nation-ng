The Nation learnt that the hoodlums invaded the hospital intent retrieving their colleague’s body but the health workers insisted on proper documentation, which the hoodlums kicked against. An eyewitness said, “The hoodlums reinforced and wanted to force their way into the premises of the hospital with dangerous weapons including axes, cutlasses, knives and charms. This resulted in the management shutting the two main gates of the hospital for two hours to prevent them from taking the corpse away. The nurses, doctors and other workers of the hospital run to safety before the security operatives intervene and proper documentation was done.” The chairman, Medical Advisory Committee, Osun State University Teaching Hospital, Osogbo, Babatunde Afolabi confirmed the incident but said the “matter has been rested; they have done the coroner’s inquest on the corpse, so they have taken the body out for burial.”
