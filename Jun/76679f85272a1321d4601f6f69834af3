The Tinubu Campaign Organisation (TCO) has disowned a viral document said to be the manifesto of the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. The document is being circulated via social media platforms in his name, despite the THOSE clarification to reporters that it is merely a draft proposal and suggestions on the programme he should implement, when elected in February 2023. The organisation said a manifesto is a more serious document. In a statement by its Director of Media and Communications, Bayo Onanuga, the group dissociated Tinubu from the document. Onanuga said the manifesto being shared mostly via WhatsApp and Facebook is not the official campaign manifesto of the candidate. He said: “Asiwaju Tinubu, in consultation with the party, experts in various fields and a broad section of the populace, through empirical and evidence-based approach, is working on an all-embracing manifesto that will be presented to Nigerians when it is ready before the official campaign begins in September.

When the official policy document of Tinubu is ready it will be formally presented to Nigerians and our candidate will be in a position to defend every word that will be contained therein. “We appreciate the interest and enthusiasm of Nigerians to know about the programmes and policy options Asiwaju Tinubu will pursue in government when elected. He is a tested and experienced leader who will bring his knowledge and expertise to run a government that will meet the aspiration and yearnings of our people across every sector.”
