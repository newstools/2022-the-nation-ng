Tiger Wood said yesterday he has withdrawn from next week’s US Open outside Boston, citing a need for more time to get his body ready for major championship golf. Woods returned to competition at the Masters in April, 14 months after nearly losing his right leg in a car crash, then played in last month’s PGA Championship where he withdrew in pain after posting a nine-over-par 79 in the third round. The news isn’t a surprise, given Woods’s struggles since he returned from his long hiatus at this year’s Masters. The 15-time Major winner was visibly affected by pain in his right leg at last month’s event at Southern Hills in Oklahoma, where he shot a career-worst 79 after barely making the cut. Woods still plans on playing at the 150th  Open Championship at St. Andrews next month. “I am looking forward to St Andrews,” he said in April. “That is something that is near and dear to my heart.

I will be there for that one.” This year’s Masters was Woods’s first official tournament since November 15, 2020, which was the final round of that year’s pandemic-delayed Masters. He had his fifth back surgery two months later and was still recovering from that on February 23, 2021, when he crashed his SUV over a median on a suburban coastal road in Los Angeles and down the side of a hill. Woods’ injuries from that crash were so severe that doctors considered right leg amputation, before reassembling the limb by placing a rod in the tibia and using screws and pins to stabilize additional injuries in the ankle and foot. Since the accident, Woods has gone from crutches to slowly walk and then playing in the last few months. He started hitting balls on the back end of the range at Albany during his Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas last November.
