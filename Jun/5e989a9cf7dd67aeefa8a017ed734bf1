The Chairman of Bariga Local Council Area in Lagos Kolade Alabi has flagged off construction of new roads in the council. The construction of the roads, he said, will commence immediately. Alabi mentioned that the flagging off of the “life-changing and transforming projects was done in commemoration of the 57th birthday of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu.” The project, he added, was geared towards massive intervention on access and link roads, boost security and increase the socio-economic well-being of residents of Bariga.

Speaking at the ground breaking of the roads at Ijagbemi Street, Alabi said the flagging off was not only a bold confirmation of a promise kept, but a legacy project. “It is a project that has been conceptualised for a long time, but due to the complexity, it has taken time, but is now necessary because of the desire to reduce travel time to Charly Boy and the Gbagada-Oshodi Expressway,” he said. The council chief said there will be total rehabilitation of Ajidagan Road.
