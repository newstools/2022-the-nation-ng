A wonderkid, Marvelous Osarugwe aka Youngwiz Global has disclosed how the sudden death of his mother inspired him to become a musician. The 12-year-old Afropop singer, who hails from Edo state but lives in Lagos, said he started singing out of depression even though music runs in his family. “My music is inspired by my travails when my mom died on August 16, 2021, at the age of 39 years which left me and my little siblings,” he said.
