Nottingham Forest have signed Nigeria forward Taiwo Awoniyi from Union Berlin for a club-record fee. The 24-year-old joins newly-promoted Forest on a five-year deal for a reported £17m. Awoniyi scored 20 goals in 43 games across all competitions last season and becomes Forest’s first signing since gaining promotion back to the Premier League. “It’s always been my dream to play in the Premier League,” said Awoniyi. “Having spoken to [Forest boss] Steve Cooper about our ambitions and looking at Forest, with its great history, it’s a club that I want to be part of.” After a season-long loan, Awoniyi joined Union Berlin on a permanent deal in July 2021 from Liverpool, where he started his career.
