The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has declared that international air travel is experiencing a rebound with passenger traffic for African carriers experiencing an increase of 116.2 per cent in April, this year compared to load factor posted a year ago. According to IATA, figures posted by African carriers translated to over 93.3 per cent recorded in March, this year. Data from the global airlines’ body indicates that the April figures were up by 65.7 per cent with load factor climbing 15.7 percentage points to 67.3 per cent. IATA also indicated that as the Northern Summer travel season beckons, two things are clear: two years of border restrictions have not weakened the desire for the freedom to travel. It stated that where travel is permitted, demand rapidly is returning to pre-COVID levels. Speaking in an interview, Director-General/Chief Executive Officer, IATA, Willie Walsh said it was, however, evident that the failings in how governments managed the pandemic had continued into the recovery. “With governments making U-turns and policy changes, there was uncertainty until the last minute, leaving little time to restart an industry that was largely dormant for two years. It is no wonder that we are seeing operational delays in some locations. “In those few locations where these problems are recurring, solutions need to be found, so passengers can travel with confidence,” Walsh said. The global carriers’ body also declared that international air travel is experiencing a rebound despite Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and significant travel restrictions in China. The recovery trend, it said, was driven by a significant increase in global demand that was up 78.7 per cent  compared to April 2021 and slightly ahead of March 2022’s 76.0 percent yearly increase.

April data is cause for optimism in almost all markets, except China, which continues to severely restrict travel,’’ he added. The experience of the rest of the world is demonstrating that increased travel is manageable with high levels of population immunity and the normal systems for disease surveillance. We hope that China can recognize this success soon and take its own steps towards normality,” Walsh said. IATA reported that April domestic air travel was down 1.0 per cent  compared to the year-ago period, a reversal from the 10.6 per cent  demand rise in March. This was driven entirely by continuing strict travel restrictions in China, where domestic traffic was down 80.8 percent  year-to-year. Overall, April domestic traffic was down 25.8 per cent  versus April 2019. International Revenue Per Kilometres (RPKs), on the other hand, rose 331.9 per cent  versus April 2021, an acceleration over the 289.9 per cent  rise in March 2022 compared to a year ago. Several route areas are currently above pre-pandemic levels, including Europe – Central America, Middle East – North America and North America – Central America. April 2022 international RPKs   were down 43.4 per cent  compared to the same month in 2019. European carriers’ April international traffic rose 480.0 per cent  versus April 2021, substantially up over the 434.3 percent  increase in March 2022 versus the same month in 2021. Capacity rose 233.5 per cent  and load factor climbed 33.7 percentage points to 79.4 per cent . Asia-Pacific airlines saw their April international traffic climb 290.8 per cent  compared to April 2021, significantly improved on the 197.2 per cent  gain registered in March 2022 versus March 2021. Capacity rose 88.6 per cent  and the load factor was up 34.6 percentage points to 66.8 per cent , still the lowest among regions. Middle Eastern airlines had a 265.0 per cent  demand rise in April compared to April 2021, bettering the 252.7 per cent  increase in March 2022, versus the same month in 2021. April capacity rose 101.0 per cent  versus the year-ago period, and load factor climbed 32.2 percentage points to 71.7 per cent . North American carriers’ April traffic rose 230.2 per cent  versus the 2021 period, slightly above the 227.9 per cent  rise in March 2022 compared to March 2021. Capacity rose 98.5 per cent , and load factor climbed 31.6 percentage points to 79.3 per cent . Latin American airlines experienced a 263.2 per cent  rise in April traffic, compared to the same month in 2021, exceeding the 241.2 per cent  rise in March 2022 over March 2021. April capacity rose 189.1 per cent  and load factor increased 16.8 percentage points to 82.3 per cent , which easily was the highest load factor among the regions for the 19th consecutive month.
