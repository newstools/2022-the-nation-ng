Super Eagles international striker  Victor Osimhem  is being regarded as a capable replacement  for Liverpool’s want-away  Senegalese striker Sadio Mane  from  Anfield. The African Footballer of the Year  has been strongly linked with a move away from Anfield  with the possibility of teaming up  with   either Paris Saint-Germain or  Bayern Munich with words rife that Liverpool have put on him a price tag of around £42.5million. Incidentally,  there have been speculations that a host of  English Premier League sides including Manchester United, Arsenal  and Newcastle  are on the trail for the Napoli’s Nigeria forward Osimhen as the  wheeling and dealing  in the summer transfer windows get underway. But Italian legend  and former Juventus striker  Christian Vieri  has urged Liverpool to snap up Osimhen as a replacement  for Mane “If I were Liverpool, I would go and take Osimhen from Napoli. Everyone runs in Klopp’s squad, they go a thousand miles an hour,” Vieri was quoted as saying by Sport Witness.“ He would be perfect.”   Eagles in high team spirit for Ecuador, says  …      Okpekpe organiser hails Edo Govt , sponsors     AFCON 2023 Race: Super Eagles to play Sao Tome in Marrakech   Incidentally, Napoli have revealed that they will stop listening to bids for Victor Osimhen from the 8th July after placing about €100million tag on him. According to MondoNapoli, the Partenopeans are looking to close the door early on bids for Osimhen, as they have revealed that Napoli will stop listening to offers for Osimhen from the 8th of July. Asides from it being a way to keep Osimhen at the club for at least another year, it would also ensure stability and prevent distractions in the team ahead of the new season, which begins in August. Osimhen is one of the most sought-after assets in Europe at the moment, following his brilliant returns of 18 goals and six assists in 32 games for the Partenopeans.
