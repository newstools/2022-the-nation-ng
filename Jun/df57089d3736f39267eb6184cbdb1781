Nottingham Forest are reportedly  the front runners to land another Nigeria International, Rangers’ Joe Aribo after they sealed a record €17m signing of Taiwo Awoniyi from Union Berlin at the weekend Aribo is entering the final year of his contract at Rangers and last season’s Europa League runners-up are understood to be relaxed about the player’s situation with words rife that a  number of Premier League clubs are interested in the  25-year-old striker. The player has spent the last three seasons at Rangers, averaging 50 games a campaign. No player in world football made more appearances for club and country during the 2021/22 season than Aribo’s 70. He helped Rangers win the Scottish Cup while scoring in the Europa League final against Eintracht Frankfurt as he filled in for Alfredo Morelos in the attack.

And if it is the former he summered £8million would constitute “good business”. “They’re all starting players so you don’t want constant speculation,” he noted in his Sunday Mail column. “It can sidetrack the player and become a sideshow for the manager who gets asked about it every week. “So I’d like to see Aribo’s situation resolved quickly. Either re-sign him on a new deal or if the board are willing to sell, let’s bring in the most money we can. “London probably makes sense for Joe because it’s where he grew up. He will have ambitions of playing in the Premier League. And of those three players at Rangers, you have to think at least one will move on. Joe only signed for around £300k. If Rangers can get around £8million for him it’s good business.”
