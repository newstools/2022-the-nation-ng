A Makurdi-based businessman and politician, Mr. Abraham Chila has given the reason Benue State will vote massively for the All Progressives Congress (APC) Presidential candidate Ahmed Bola Tinubu in the 2023 general elections. Addressing journalists in Makurdi, weekend, Mr. Chila stated that Bola Ahmed Tinubu as the governor of Lagos State turned around the economy of the state to the largest in Africa and reduced over- dependence on the federal allocation for the running of the state. According to him, what counts Tinubu out among the other candidates is human development which led to the election of most of the over-dependence governors in the South West who are his prodigies.

On the current debate about Muslim -Muslim ticket, the business mogul stated that the problem of Nigerians and Nigeria is not religion, people are wiser, it will not matter whoever he chooses as his running mate, saying there were several attempts made to stop Tinubu from emerging as the APC flag bearer but it failed and so, he is going all the way to win the general election. “The emergence of Tinubu, Atiku, and Obi has shown that our democracy has taken firm roots and Nigerians will decide in 2023.”
