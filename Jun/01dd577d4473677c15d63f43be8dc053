The maiden John Obi Mikel’s Back2Base Talent Hunt got underway with many youths present to participate or watch from the stand at the University of Lagos Sports Centre, Akoka in Lagos. The multisport event geared towards the discovery of new talents had many willing youths hitherto without prior registration in attendance but were disappointed since organisers had over the past few weeks registered qualified players drawn mainly from various playing grounds in Lagos. However, many of them returned to the stand and watched with delight how participants displayed their talents across the three sports namely football, tennis, and basketball.
