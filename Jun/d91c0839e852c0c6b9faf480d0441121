The  Super Eagles had to come from behind to overcome the stubborn Leone Stars of Sierra Leone 2-1 on Day 1 encounter of the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualification series at the MKO Abiola Stadium yesterday.. The fleet-footed Leone Stars ran riot at the Super Eagles’ door in the 4th minute, when a rasping shot from Mohamed Turay was tipped over by goalkeeper Francis Uzoho. And the visitors took the lead in the 11th  with Jonathan Morsay scoring with a diving header from a pin-point pull-out from Alhassan Koroma to beat Uzoho and gave the Leone Stars a lead. But their lead did not last long as an exchange of passes between Alex Iwobi and Moses Simon ended with the Everton star emphatically finding the far corner of goalkeeper Mohamed Kamara’s post to level up the match for the Eagles.

In the second half, the game flowed from one end to the other, but Nigeria should have made it 3-1 in the 58th  minute when Iwobi and Osimhen carved open the visitors’ defence, only for Samuel Chukwueze to get too much purchase on his shot and drag it wide. Aribo, Osimhen, and substitute Ademola Lookman all missed chances as Nigeria pushed for another goal, but in added time, it took Aribo’s last-second intervention to deny the Leone Stars. Meanwhile, Guinea Bissau topped the group after beating Sao Tome and Principe 5-1 yesterday as well and the Eagles will be heading to Agadir, Morocco for their Day 2 encounter against the ‘The Falcons and True Parrots’ of São Tomé and Príncipe on Monday, while Sierra Leone host Guinea Bissau.
