Coach Emmanuel Amuneke has described the Spanish Football Federation organized  UEFA Pro Coaching Seminar held over the weekend in Santander  as enriching and engrossing, adding Nigerian coaches must be exposed to continuous education in order to compete favourably with their foreign counterparts. The former Barcelona winger  who is a holder of the prestigious  UEFA Pro License, said the seminar  which is a  biennial  event  was an opportunity to rub minds with some elite coaches  in order to update his knowledge ‘ since the game is not static. “It was  a great privilege to participate in this kind of programme  because it offers me  the opportunity  to update my knowledge and you know as a coach, it is important for us to constantly re-evaluate  and update ourselves about the new trends in coaching,” said  the former Tanzania national team coach.  “Just as the  players are evolving, the coaches too need to continue to develop themselves and that is why this program is very important to me.”   Cricket: Uganda upsets Nigeria in  Kwibuka     PSG, Pochettino part ways     Obafemi leads Ireland to first Nations League win   Some of the instructors at this year’s seminar included  current Spanish national team manager Manuel  Casas  popularly known as Molo; Atletico Bilbao coach Juan Iribarren, erstwhile Barcelona coach Quique Setien,  current Goalkeeping coach of Real Valladolid  José Manuel Santisteban  as well as former World Cup winner Xavi Alonso amongst others. “It was opportunity to share knowledge with so many experienced coaches, teachers  as well as people  working with the Spanish national team and  learn new things  regarding  planning and management of the game,” he said. “I hope a lot of our coaches back home will also have the opportunity of retraining  themselves from time to time.” Meanwhile, the former African Footballer of the Year was last night awarded Sports Icon of the Year 2021/2022  by the organisers of the Nigeria Iconic Watch Media Grand Award  at its gala held at Civic Centre in Victoria Island, Lagos.
