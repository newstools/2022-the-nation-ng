Arsenal’s reported £51 million bid for Victor Osimhen was rejected as Napoli want £85m for the Nigerian international. Arsenal are expected to have a very busy summer transfer window as Mikel Arteta plans to continue to mould the squad into one that fully represents his identity. Strengthening the forward line is imperative for the north Londoners and a whole host of players have been linked with a move to the Emirates. Gabriel Jesus is reportedly the club’s number one target, and the Brazilian looks set to leave Manchester City this summer following the arrival of Erling Haaland. Certainly, it would be an excellent piece of business if Arsenal signed the Brazilian international. Jesus is incredibly versatile, capable of operating across the entire frontline, and possesses significant experience despite only being 25 years of age.

Osimhen has been heavily linked with Arsenal and the Nigerian had an excellent second season in Italy. The 23-year-old notched 14 goals in 23 starts in Serie A and the Nigerian is attracting interest from a whole host of clubs across Europe. There has been a lot of uncertainty surrounding how much money would be needed to start negotiations, but if recent reports are to be believed, Napoli are said to be willing to sell their talisman for £85 million. The report also states that Arsenal have previously had a £51 million bid rejected so whether the Gunners would be willing to up their initial offer.
