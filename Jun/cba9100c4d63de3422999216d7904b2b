Victor Osimhen has said that the unity and quality within the Super Eagles would help them achieve success going into the future. The Napoli hitman showed his undoubted talent by bagging four goals for Nigeria as the team recorded its biggest ever win in international football, thrashing  hapless Sao Tome and Principe 10-0 in their second Group A win in the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifiers at the Stade d’ Agadir, Morocco. The 23-year-old now has 15 goals in 22 international caps for the Super Eagles and is the top scorer in AFCON qualifiers with  five goals in two games. He was also particularly pleased with his strike partner Terem Moffi , who scored a brace, and two others were also able to score their first goals in the national team colours.

There is a big solidarity in the team and this has been what the coach has been telling us and as a group I believe we have the quality to continue to build on this momentum,” he added. “Of course I want to keep on scoring goals for the team and each game we want to get the three points and win every match. “ That is our objective and we are looking forward to performing,” he noted.
