Former Member of the House of Representatives in Ifako-Ijaiye Federal Constituency of Lagos State, Yomi Ogunnusi has hailed Governor Gboyega Oyetola of Osun State for his financial propriety in the last four years. Ogunnusi, whose firm was commissioned to review interest, commission, and unauthorized debits, as well as other charges on account back-duty, maintained from 2012 to 2018 on behalf of Osun by some commercial banks.

I believe what he has done, the state can recover more monies from these banks to help increase the Internal Generated Revenue (IGR) for the state and hope that banks can focus on their statutory duties rather than engaging in frivolous activities that will impoverish states and individuals,” the former lawmaker said. He, however, charged the electorates to vote en-masse to re-elect Oyetola for another four-year term in next month’s gubernatorial election.
