The county called for stronger ties with Nigeria through aviation and other sectors to garner a mutually beneficial front for Nigeria and the U.S municipal. The mission announced this at a meeting with the Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) and other stakeholders yesterday in Lagos. Over 40 delegates from different fields in the U.S interacted with Nigerians from various strata of the economy to express their intent to build stronger business bonds. FAAN Managing Director, Captain Rabiu Yadudu, who gave the welcome remarks, said the agency was consistently seeking new avenues for expansion and not depending mainly on aeronautical sources of revenue.

Also, FAAN’s Director of Human Resources, Mr. Norris Anozie, said the agency would ensure that its relationship with the county yields positive results. “Our take home as an authority is to build the relationship, and in building that relationship, we would find similarities between both sides. We have the opportunity to expand and diversify those similarities. “We are happy they came and established a relationship and we hope this would help grow our own facilities and passengers. Part of the reason for the visit is to expand tourism and air transport,” he said.
