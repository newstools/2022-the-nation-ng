In the end, Bashir Machina has prevailed over Senate President Ahmad Lawan. It is a real irony that the man who had it for the taking went after what he had no chance of taking. No, he will have neither senate nor presidency. It is a triumph for the rule of law. It calls to mind the Greek myth that has gained currency as deus ex machina, which literally means a god in a machine.   Onnoghen’s ghost     Train of two traitors     A Pan-Nigerian ticket   In simple terms, it means a miracle. Lawan was the one hoping for dues ex machina, even after his name was submitted by his party chairman. The law prevailed. Machina was there to take his own miracle. You cannot take machina from Machina. The miracle, the deus ex machina, belongs to the man who bears the name.
