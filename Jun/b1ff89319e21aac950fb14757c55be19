Actress Charity Nnaji has advised ladies who haven’t attained the ‘big girl’ status to steer clear of the movie industry, Nollywood. The movie star, speaking in a chat with Sunday Scoop, stated one major challenge bedeviling the industry is ‘s3x-for-roles.’ Nnaji explained if a lady who isn’t financially buoyant decides to venture into the industry, she’d be subjected to ‘s3x-for-roles’ by movie directors, producers and even actors. She claimed such an unhealthy practice is what necessitated her advice to preempt such exploitation where promising young ladies get turned into s3x slaves because they lack the finance to produce their own movies.

I won’t tell you that the industry is favourable, especially when one does not have the funds to produce one’s movies.
