The youths said: “Okowa is a true son of Igboland, a bonafide member of Ohanaeze; we cannot, therefore, rise against one of our own. “A former President-General of Ohanaeze, Late Ambassador Ralph Uwechue is from the same area as Okowa. They are our brothers by every standard and we cannot ditch them now simply because of political exigency.”   Atiku’s VP: Okowa’s choice, wise decision – PDP chieftain     Group hails northern governors, others on Tinubu’s victory     2023: Why PDP is losing grip in Delta   While noting that Ndigbo was not happy for not getting the PDP presidential slot, they asked: “should we now throw away the baby with the bathwater? “Having said this, we reiterate that Ndigbo are happy with his emergence as the vice presidential candidate of the PDP and will accord him all the needed support. “We urge Ndigbo to support him; we must be strategic this time and not put all our eggs in one basket.”
