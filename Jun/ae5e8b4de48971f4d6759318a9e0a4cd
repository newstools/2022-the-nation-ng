The National Union of Electricity Employees (NUEE) has rejected the three-point agenda of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, targeting privatisation of refineries, rail sector and the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN). The union said it was challenging the former Vice President to a debate on national television to prove how “the retrogressive economic policy will impact positively on the masses.” The union made its position known in a statement issued by its General Secretary, Joe Ajaero on yesterday in Abuja. The statement reads: “Our attention has been drawn to Newspaper reports released by the presidential candidate of the PDP, Alhaji Abubakar Atiku, rolling out a three-point agenda, targeting privatisation of refineries, rail sector, the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) and breaking monopoly of all other infrastructure operations. “Alhaji Abubakar Atiku was the Chairman of the National Council on Privatisation (NCP), a government committee entrusted with the responsibility of managing the privatisation programme initiated by the Olusegun Obasanjo administration to handle the disposal of public enterprises.   Four nuggets from George Bernard Shaw     Atiku: PDP begins reconciliation of Lagos factions     Ndigbo not under attack in Lagos – Ohanaeze leader   “Of the over 60 enterprises privatised when he became NCP Chairman in 1999, how many of them are functioning optimally? From the Osogbo Steel rolling mill which has become a glorified warehouse to the abysmal performances of the privatised Generation Companies (GenCos) and Distribution Companies (DisCos) over eight (8) years after privatization. “From seventeen (17) out of the eighteen (18) Companies sold in the Power Sector, none is yet to break even while the Federal Government has pumped in about N2 trillion as subvention to these privately owned companies, power generation has nose dived from 4,000 megawatts to 2000 Megawatts in nine years. “Who are the ‘faceless’ owners of these private companies and why are they shrouded in so much secrecy? Since this privatisation agenda commenced, many Nigerians lost their jobs, many Nigerians have died as a result of non-payment of their entitlements, many Nigerians are sick and hungry with their children thrown out of school as the onslaught against Nigerian masses continues in the name of privatisation.”a
