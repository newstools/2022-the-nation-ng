Frank Lampard’s Everton have joined David Moyes’s West Ham United and Eddie Howe’s Newcastle United in the race for Watford striker Emmanuel Dennis, according to The Daily Mail. The Mirror had reported earlier that West Ham were planning to make a £20 million bid for Dennis with further claim that Newcastle are also interested in the 24-year-old Nigeria international striker. And now, The Daily Mail are reporting that Everton are eyeing a move for Dennis, who is valued at £20 million by his club Watford. Watford will play in the Championship next season after getting relegated from the Premier League.

It is likely that Dennis will leave Watford in the summer transfer window amid interest from Everton, Newcastle, and West Ham United. Denis scored 10 goals and gave six assists in 30 Premier League starts for Watford last season. The striker has shown that he is good enough to play in the Premier League, and with Watford in the Championship next season, the Hornets will have to sell him if a good offer comes in.
