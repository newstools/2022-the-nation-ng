Comedian AY has stated he has an ingenious idea but needs the motivation to pull it through. The film producer, who is a Guinness Book of World Records holder with his movie “30 days in Atlanta”, said he’s considering buying Central Bank but seeks advice from his social circle.  According to the comic boss, people have no business being ‘broke’ when there exists a Central Bank which ought to print money for the citizens. “There are so many ideas that require us to seek for validation and agreement from our social circle. “Sometimes we do value others’ opinions and how they shape our perspective, we are much more motivated by external validation than our own intuition. “Please advise me, should I buy Central Bank? Because I see no reason why everyone should be broke when we can just print money and give to everyone,” AY said.
