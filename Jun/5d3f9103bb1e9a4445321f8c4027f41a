Scottish giants  Glasgow Rangers  yesterday confirmed  the exit  of Super Eagles defender  Leon Balogun  along  with back-up goalkeeper Andy Firth  as Dutch coach  Giovanni van Bronckhorst  begin the  summer rebuild of  the Light Blues ahead of next season. The  UEFA Europa Cup runners up  announced the departure of the duo  via its official twitter handle @RangersFC yesterday stating  : “Rangers can today confirm that @LeonBalogun and @andyfirth1996 will depart the club following the expiration of their contracts. Everyone at Ibrox wishes Leon & Andy well for the next move in their career.” Balogun currently on duty with Nigeria  for the 2013 AFCON qualifiers against Sierra Leone  and Sao Tome and Principe, joined Rangers in July 2020 before penning a 12-month contract extension the following summer. The centre-back made 65 appearances for the Gers and was part of a strong defensive line, helping the club secure the Scottish Premiership title for the first time in a decade during season 2020/21, with an unbeaten home record.   22nd  African Athletics Championships: Amusan, Brume lead…     2023 AFCON Qualifiers: Leone Stars’ striker vows to wreck…     Scoring against Chelsea remains evergreen, says Osimhen   The 33-year-old scored two goals during the club’s sensational run to the Europa League Final in Seville last month but his time in Scotland was hampered by various injury problems. Meanwhile, Firth who  arrived at Ibrox in January 2019, is considered surplus to requirement as he spent the second half of last season on loan at Championship side Partick Thistle. Ditto for Maxwell  as he failed to break into the Gers first-team after loan spells with Ayr United and Queen of the South.
