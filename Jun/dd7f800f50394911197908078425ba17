The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Dr Muhammad Abubakar, has said an estimated 10 million Nigerians are actively engaged in primary and secondary fisheries operations. Abubakar stated that the Nigerian government is currently encouraging backward integration through commercial aquaculture production to boost local production. The move, he said, will further increase the country’s annual fish production and thereby reducing the 2.5 million metric tons of fish imported into the country annually. Speaking at the closing ceremony of the Internal Coordination Meeting of Implementation of Fisheries Governance Project Phase 2 (FisheriesGov 2), Dr Abubakar said Nigeria’s total demand for fish is 3.6 million tons annually while it produces 1.1 million tons from all sources (Artisanal, Aquaculture, and Industrial sectors) leaving a deficit of about 2.5 million tons.   ‘Women can sustain GDP growth’     Sanwo-Olu, NCC, others review ease of doing business     FAAN eyes seven per cent passenger growth   He added that the Federal Government measures are to enable the fisheries subsector gain the desired prominence.
