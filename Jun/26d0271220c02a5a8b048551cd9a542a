Members of staff of the Kwara State College of Education, Ilorin, and the school authority, are disagreeing over the alleged mismanagement of N100 million cooperative societies fund. Members of the three cooperative societies took to the streets to protest the alleged mismanagement of the money deducted from their salaries in the last one year to enhance their welfare. Spokesperson of the college’s cooperative societies Hadi Atanda said said the deduction had impoverished them, especially now that Eid-Kabir is just few weeks away.

According to him, the college had been managing to pay the monthly check off dues of all unions and societies from the meagre resources available, with help from the government. Ayinla also said N100 million, being the outstanding debt to the cooperatives societies and Ileya savings of the workers, was a summation of inherited debts from previous administrations till date. He added that the two-week old strike by the teaching staff had caused a drop in the revenue accruable to the institution. According to him, the college’s current financial situation has not allowed it settle both inherited and new debts. He said: “The N40 million subvention from the government has dropped to N32 million since January this year; that’s a shortfall of N8 million. We now struggle to pay salary. Then, payment into school account is dropping daily as no student had paid since two weeks ago. The school gate is locked against the students and staff, and no one is paying any kobo into the college account. This has compounded the school’s financial problem.”
