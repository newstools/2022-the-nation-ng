Spanish publication Larazon has claimed Benfica are the most interested party among Umar Sadiq’s suitors, ready to get a deal done for the Almeria forward this summer. Benfica have a massive hole to fill after they allowed exciting Uruguayan striker Darwin Núñez to leave for Liverpool in a deal believed to be in the region of €75 million. It is a financially successful operation for the Eagles as they only paid €39 million to Almeria for Núñez’s signature two years ago. Benfica want a repeat of that transfer dealing and are planning on swooping on the most valuable star that the Spaniards have on offer.

Previously linked to Barcelona, Manchester City, and Bayern Munich, Sadiq remains on the radar of Sevilla and Valencia. But Larazon claimed  Benfica – with a healthy purse – are leading the race for the Super Eagles star’s capture. While Sadiq maintains that he wants to stay and experience La Liga with Almeria, the Rojiblancos are open to letting the 25-year-old leave for a reasonable transfer fee. La Union have lined up former Manchester United striker Edinson Cavani as a possible replacement in case Sadiq departs the Mediterranean Games Stadium.
