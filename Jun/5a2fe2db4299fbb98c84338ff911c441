Total investment in the Nigerian manufacturing sector reached N217.22 billion in 2021, up from N118.52 billion in 2020.

To promote investment in the manufacturing sector, MAN President, Mansur Ahmed, an engineer, said there was a need to encourage investment in the local development of raw materials through direct incentives. He also called on the nation’s economic managers, particularly the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to ensure that a significant proportion of available foreign exchange is allocated to productive purposes. Mansur also made a case for the strengthening of the Bank of Industry (BOI) and Bank of Agriculture (BOA) to adequately provide liberal finance for the manufacturing sector, as well as provide credit guarantees for industrial loans from commercial banks. The MAN chief also said industrial policies in the country should be allowed to gestate with proper monitoring and evaluation rather than jettisoning or altering them frequently.
