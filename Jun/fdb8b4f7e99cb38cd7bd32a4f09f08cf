For Kingsley Moghalu, a former Deputy Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and presidential aspirant on the platform of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), it was an abrupt end to his dream of contesting and winning the next presidential election. Moghalu was declared loser of the contest after he was beaten to the party’s ticket by Dumebi Kachiku during the week. Sentry gathered from close allies of the disappointed politician that he had high hopes of clinching the ADC ticket.

Before the commencement of voting, Moghalu had said he would defeat Bola Tinubu and Atiku Abubakar, presidential candidates of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) at the 2023 election. “I am here to offer myself to you not because I am better than anybody here but because I care about the future of our country. I offer myself because God has given me the main recognition to stand side-by-side with Atiku, Tinubu and to send them into retirement,” he had said. But Kachiku put paid to such high hopes. Moghalu, however, said as a person of faith, he believes that God knows his plans for him, and will lead him to a perfect end that he may not know as a mere mortal. Friends and foes alike are now eagerly waiting to see what that end would be.
