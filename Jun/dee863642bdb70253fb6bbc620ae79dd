Petr Cech became the latest member of Chelsea’s senior management team to leave the club on Monday following a change in ownership. Long-serving chairman Bruce Buck and director Marina Granovskaia also departed Stamford Bridge last week in the wake of a takeover from American Todd Boehly’s consortium. Cech, who won 13 major honours with Chelsea during his playing career as a goalkeeper, became the club’s technical and performance advisor when he retired in 2019. “It has been a huge privilege to perform this role at Chelsea for the past three years,” Cech said in a club statement. “With the club under new ownership, I feel now is the right time for me to step aside.

Chelsea, who finished third in the Premier League last season, have been linked with moves for Juventus defender Matthijs de Ligt, Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling and Barcelona forward Ousmane Dembele. The club’s record signing, Romelu Lukaku, is reportedly set to re-join Inter Milan on loan just one year after making a move in the opposite direction for £98 million ($120 million).
