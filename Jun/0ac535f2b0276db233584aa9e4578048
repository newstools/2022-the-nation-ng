The leadership of Tinubu Network Organization (TNO) yesterday said the success of former Governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu in the primary election was premised on bravery and political influence. The group said the power play, twists and turns, as well as intrigues and antics that characterised the party’s convention was constructed to scuttle Tinubu’s ambition. A joint statement by the Director-General of the group, Ganiyu Maroof and Osun State Coordinator, Comrade Jimoh Olorede, the organization described Tinubu’s success as heralding a new era for Nigeria.
