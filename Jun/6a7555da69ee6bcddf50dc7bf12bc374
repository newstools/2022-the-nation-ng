The Presidency yesterday allayed fears on the health of former Head of State Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar. Gen. Abdulsami was flown abroad for medical reasons, fuelling anxiety that he was critically ill. But the Presidency said the one-time leader was stable and recuperating in a private apartment in the UK after treatment. Gen. Abdulsalami, 80, was head of state between 1998 and 1999 when he handed over power to President Olusegun Obasanjo. The update on his health was provided by President Muhammadu Buhari’s Special Assistant on Media and Publicity Mallam Garba Shehu. In a series of tweets @GarShehu yesterday, he tweeted “there is no cause for alarm”. According to Shehu, he visited Abubakar, who had already left the hospital and taken to an apartment.
