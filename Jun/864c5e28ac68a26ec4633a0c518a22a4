He however bemoaned rumours from some quarters that the governor would renege on his promises after his re-election. “The Governor who has never failed in performing his statutory obligations in the last three and a half years, who increased the length of service year of teachers to 40, would never renege on his promises after reelection. The Governor recruited over one thousand teachers in public schools despite lean receipt of allocation from the federation account as the 34th least FAAC allocation receiving state out of the 36 states of the federation.
