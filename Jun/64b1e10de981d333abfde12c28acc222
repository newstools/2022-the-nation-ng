Top Nigerian singer and music executive, Oluwatosin Ajibade, aka Mr Eazi, has released a documentary on the lead single off his upcoming debut album. Mr Eazi’s collaboration with Benin-based painter Patricorel was documented in a new short film tagged “The Legalize Art Experience.” The mini-documentary, directed by Demola Falomo, captures Eazi’s first time performing “Legalize,” the first single from his forthcoming debut album, as Patricorel creates the single’s artwork onsite for an intimate audience. The visuals were filmed at an invite-only event that was held in Lekki, Lagos.   Falz releases 12-track album Bahd     BBNAIJA’S ALEX: My man must be taller than me     I don’t sing for money but to win souls –Awolumate   Inspired by his growing interest in acquiring and giving a platform to African art, Mr Eazi sees his yet-to-be-titled debut album as a collection of art pieces. According to Mr Eazi, each single from the album will be represented in the form of a series of uniquely commissioned pieces from different African visual artists. These pieces will be tokenized and shared with the public through specially curated metaverse and physical events. For “Legalize,” Mr Eazi tapped Patricorel, whose work he was introduced to while recording for the album in Cotonou, Benin. While the song sees Eazi exposing his emotions as he celebrates his love for fiancée Temi Otedola, Patricorel’s painting by the same name simultaneously captures the intimacy of love, submission, vulnerability, and death’s finality. “I see the instrumental as a canvas…. just like Patricorel… It’s a plain canvas and you don’t know what you will create,” Eazi explains.
