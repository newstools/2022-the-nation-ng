The stock market had regained more confidence at the start of the year, with key drivers like BUA Foods, listing on NGX; investors’ reaction to companies’ full-year earnings and dividend declarations; predominance of domestic players over foreign players in the market, and low yields in the fixed income market which forced investors to consider more profitable securities in the equity market. Market analysts said domestic investors might have been taking advantage of the low prices of stocks on the NGX to increase their investments. Analysts said investors were increasing their stakes in the equities market due to the attractive dividend yield in the market and because of the low yield environment in the fixed income market. They noted that the development was good for the market as it would restore credibility and stability to the market, which was hitherto marred by volatility occasioned by the activities of foreign investors.
