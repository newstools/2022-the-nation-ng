This year, for the first time, ACHEMA will fully integrate the congress into the exhibition programme. Manufacturers and service providers from almost 50 nations will present their products and currently, more than 2,000 exhibitors have already registered.” He highlighted that Nigeria is an important market and hub for the process industries. “Against this background, and also in the context of  geopolitical turbulences, it is even more essential for us to reach out to new destinations – which is why this time we are holding, in close cooperation with the Delegation of German Industry and Commerce in Nigeria (AHK Nigeria), our first-ever press conference in Lagos,” he said. The Delegate of German Industry and Commerce in Nigeria, Katharina Felgenhauer, pledged her support to the team for focusing on the Nigerian market.
