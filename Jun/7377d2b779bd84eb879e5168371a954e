Tima Godbless ran  a huge 11.25s to qualify for the final of the women’s 100m  yesterday  at the on-going  22nd African Athletics Championships in Mauritius. Godbless came second in her semifinal heat behind one of pre-championship favourites, Carina Horn of South Africa who won in 11.08s. The Nigerian will need to run another huge personal best to stand a chance of making the podium today and probably a Nigerian win eight years after Blessing Okagbare won the country’s last gold medal in the event. Meanwhile, reigning African Games 100m champion Raymond Ekevwo moved closer to ending Nigeria’s 12 year wait for the blue riband gold after  also qualifying for today’s final. Ekevwo did not make the final without breaking sweat as he finished  third in the third semifinal heat, thereby missing one of the two  automatic slots for the final.

Kenya’s reigning African record holder, Ferdinand Omanyala led the way once again with his 10.07s performance with defending champion, South Africa’s Akani Simbine the second fastest qualifier for Thursday’s final. Ekevwo will now need to run faster than the 9.96s he ran three years ago that fetched him the African Games gold to stand a chance of making the podium. In the women’s 400m, the duo of Idamadudu Praise (54.61) and Patience Okon George (52.19) qualified for the semifinal  while in the men’s,  the trio of Samson Nathaniel (47.01), Adeyemi Sikiru (46.73) and junior international, Nnamani Johnson (47.37) all made it to the semifinals.
