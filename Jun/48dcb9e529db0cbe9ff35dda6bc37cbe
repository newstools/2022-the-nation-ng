In his speech, Group Managing Director, Niger Delta Exploration and Production Company, Adegbite Falade stressed the need to build more critical infrastructure that would allow domestic consumption. He said there was need to be proactive about it. To him, the configuration of the nation’s oil and gas has been around monetising “our resources by export sales and this was done to underpin the interest of International Oil Companies (IOCs) who needed our industry more for energy security in their own countries.”
