Tyson Fury has named six opponents who could tempt him back into the boxing ring after revealing he is “100 per cent” going to fight again. The Gypsy King claimed he was retiring after beating Dillian Whyte, but the 33-year-old could yet return to action. SunSport exclusively revealed yesterday that Fury could come out of retirement and he told the Mirror “never say never” when quizzed about a potential unification bout against Anthony Joshua or Oleksandr Usyk. But the Gypsy King also has his eye on six other opponents to take on in exhibition bouts.

Elsewhere 55-year-old Mike Tyson is on his list of potential opponents after the American himself has fought in exhibition bouts since retiring. Fury said: “I can come back whenever if I wanted to. For now, I’m happily contented, and I might do a few exhibitions, Mike Tyson or one of the Klitschkos, someone like that, the showbiz and entertainment stuff. “It’s something people are interested these days.”
