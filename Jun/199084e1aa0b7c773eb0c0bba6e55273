Karim Benzema has spoken about his style of play, his beginnings at Real Madrid and the small problem he once had with Jose Mourinho. Following a successful season, Benzema has taken stock and looked back over his career so far. “I play by instinct, I’m an instinctive player and whatever comes into my head I do it on the pitch,” Benzema told Onze Mondial in an interview, when asked about his approach on the football pitch. “I never say to myself ‘I’m going to play against this defender, I have to do this or that’.” Benzema also elaborated on his early days at Real Madrid and the difficulties he faced at the beginning. “My first season, the first six months, were very difficult, as I was alone and I didn’t speak the language so everything was complicated,” Benzema explained. “I had arrived in a new world, with a new team, a different type of football. Luckily I didn’t give up.

The next day I scored and we won 1-0.” Cristiano Ronaldo is one of the players Benzema has always been inspired by and he discussed this in the interview.   “When I watched what he did, I tried to concentrate on his movements: the dribbling, the finishing, the passing, his ball handling, I dissected everything about him,” Benzema said.   “But, then it’s impossible to achieve the same thing.”   Despite a trophy-laden trophy cabinet, Benzema still dreams of winning a few more, especially the World Cup since he wasn’t part of France’s 2018 squad.
