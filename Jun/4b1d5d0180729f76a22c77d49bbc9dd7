An aide of Delta Governor, Ossai Success has advised controversial artist, Habeeb Okikiola aka Portable to undergo alcohol and drug rehabilitation. He was reacting to a video where the artist masterminded the beating of a former friend for sending a message to his wife. On his verified Facebook page, Success said: “Take Portable to alcohol and drug rehabilitation centre. As a young boy, I love Zazu singer Portable’s zeal for defeating poverty but the truth must be told.   We’ll fix Justices’ complaints on work…     Remaining kidnapped railway passengers must be rescued…     Former NFF Scribe, two others freed in Bauchi   “There are a lot of misbehaviours in him that are associated with too much alcohol and drugs. This young boy needs to be taken care of before he gets himself damaged all in the name of fame. “Someone close to him should as a matter of urgency take Portable to an alcohol and drug rehabilitation centre. Don’t say his character is what is giving him fame because this is how some people started having kidney problems or musical careers started dying while people were busy hailing them. “I need him to be better in doing his things and that is why I am so concerned about his well-being. He needs urgent attention.”
