The Executive Secretary of Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC), Dr Hamid Bobboyi has said Nigeria does not have credible data for national planning in the basic education sector,hence school census was imperative to address it. He spoke at a meeting with stakeholders on the ongoing National Personnel Audit in Lagos. Bobboyi noted that private schools in Lagos state refused to grant access to the 177 enumerators who were deployed across the state to audit schools. He told private school owners that the commission had no ulterior motive with the data being collected across Lagos State schools. He said : ‘‘We have come to look at how to encourage our private schools to participate in the census. “We want to check our enumerators and listen to their challenges and how we can help them.

The National Personnel Audit report is also not for taxation. “We need data to give us an idea of what will be needed for national planning; it will also give you an idea of the challenges, in terms of the number of out-of-school children.” Bobboyi, however, urged private school owners to allow the enumerators to collect their school’s data. A representative of the National Association of Proprietors of Private Schools(NAPPS), Lagos chapter, Dr Comfort Otegbeye, noted that private schools refused to welcome the UBEC enumerators because they felt their information would used for taxation. Executive Chairman, Lagos State Universal Basic Education Board(LASUBEB), Mr Wahab Alawiye-King, urged the school owners to cooperate with the enumerators. He noted that they would be sensitised.
