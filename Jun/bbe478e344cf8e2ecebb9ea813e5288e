Golden Eaglets head coach Nduka Ugbade is looking beyond the WAFU B tournament in Ghana, hoping for a day African teams can rub shoulders with their South American and European counterparts on the world stage. Ugbade is currently in Ghana where his team are making a big impact at the WAFU B U-17 Championship. They will face the runners-up in Group B on Monday with the winners of this clash advancing to the U17 AFCON in Algeria next year and the final of the qualifiers.

The Eaglets had earlier defeated hosts Ghana 4-2 in the competition’s opening game last Saturday. “Beyond the game itself, I am looking forward to a day that an African team would be able to prove itself at the highest level and someday we would get there,” Nduka said on Brila FM yesterday.  “I want an African team to rub shoulders with the likes of Brazil, France and Argentina. “I am not satisfied with winning, I am always looking to improve my team,” he added.
