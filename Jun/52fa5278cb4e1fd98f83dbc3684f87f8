Former Oyo Governor Senator Rashidi Ladoja will on Friday be installed as Otun Olubadan of Ibadanland by the Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Lekan Balogun at the Aliiwo palace in Ibadan. The elevation of the former Governor, who holds the title of Osi-Olubadan is sequel to the vacuum created by the demise of the former Olubadan, late Oba Saliu Adetunji, Aje Ogungunniso 1 which paved the way for the promotion and installation of Senator Lekan Balogun as the new Olubadan of Ibadanland on March 11, 2022.

The statement reads in part: “Following the promotion of the former governor, High Chief Eddy Oyewole who presently holds the title of Ashipa Olubadan would become Osi-Olubadan and High Chief Biodun Kola-Daisi would from Ekerin Olubadan become Ashipa Olubadan. “Similarly, the current Ekarun Olubadan, High Chief Hamidu Ajibade would be installed as the Ekerin Olubadan while the trail blazer in the private ownership of radio station in the ancient metropolis, the promoter of Splash F.M, Senior Chief Adebayo Akande, the current Maye Olubadan moves up to become High Chief with the title of Ekarun Olubadan.” Olubadan congratulated the promoted lieutenants with a charge to them to see their elevation as a call to higher duty for the growth, development and progress of Ibadanland.
