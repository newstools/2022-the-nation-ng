London-Lagos biker and a member of Rotary Club International Kunle Adeyanju has conceded the adventure was tortuous and risky. Adeyanju added that he cheated death during the 41-day travel four times. The biker told reporters in Ilorin, Kwara state on the sidelines of a reception organised for him by the state Rotary Clubs. According to him: “Truth is that every kilometre of the 12,000 I covered was fraught with challenges, pains and difficulties. ” Several times I came close to dying. I actually saw death several times. When people say the saw death I never believed that but when I saw that like four times in Sahara and Mali I now believe that death exists. “God just wants to keep me alive that is why death did not take me. But one thing I said to myself was that whatever it took I would not quit.”   One die, three injured as gunmen attack Plateau community     Nurse gets support after losing legs in Owo terror attack     Igweship throne tears Enugu community apart   On the motive behind the adventure, the Offa- born biker said that “doing this was basically to achieve two purposes of raising awareness of end polio message by seeing how we can see the level of vaccines acceptance. ” The second objective was to raise fund. For me the two had been accomplished because everybody is now aware of polio. Polio has got a renewed drive as we have the vaccines to end the virus. “I am very happy that the message has taken a global dimension. “The London-Lagos ride covered a total of 12,000 kilometres spanning through 13 countries and 41 cities.
