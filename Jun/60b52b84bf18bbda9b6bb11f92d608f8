The Federal government has declared June 28 every year to be marked as National Pasture Planting Day to encourage private and public sector investments in commercial pasture production. Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Dr Mohammad Mahmood Abubakar made this known in Abuja yesterday during the flag-off of the National Pasture Development Programme (NAPDEP) at Paiko Kore Grazing Reserve, Gwagwalada. The move, he said, was part of efforts in promoting intentional pasture development. “This will give a great opportunity to unlock the potential of the Livestock industry and the development of its rich value chains,” he said.

According to him, the NAPDEP would serve as a panacea for reduction in conflict emanating from cattle movement, attainment of self-sufficiency in good quality pasture forage production and the transition from extensive grazing to a well-planned, settled form of livestock production. He stated that the result of continuous movement in search of pasture has adversely affected the animals’ attainment of their optimal productivity and consistently impaired the national capacity for self-sufficiency in livestock products and animal protein needs, especially national target of 1.6 billion liters of milk per annum. He said: “This has eluded our national peace-building efforts through the incessant conflict between pastoralists and crop farmers along their movement routes. These have also impaired improvement in the livelihood of the pastoral families in particular and neighboring crop farmers”.
