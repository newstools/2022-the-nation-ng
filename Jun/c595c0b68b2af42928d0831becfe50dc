Ademola Lookman would be a good squad addition for Leicester, but to splash out £14million on a player who did start only 16 league games might be difficult to defend. To see him getting more time on the field with James Maddison, Harvey Barnes, and Jamie Vardy as main contenders look very unlikely. His contract with RB Leipzig is running for two more seasons and they will be fighting for both domestic and European titles as Bundesliga and Champions League will be their home ground. After watching Ademola Lookman for Leicester last season you know he will be a good asset for a club fighting in Bundesliga.

The move can of course be agreed but we do feel that the player himself will be reluctant to move with less game time and then in real setting his international future on the play. Leicester do have the option to sign the player but must make up their mind very soon as the deal is close to expiring and will do so on the 30th  of June. Lookman was not in play for Nigeria in their recent games away to Mexico, and Ecuador, but is included in the squad for current games coming up against Sierra Leone and Sao Tome. Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers might be keen on signing Ademola Lookman, but this is also a massive decision for the player himself as his move could see him getting less games than this season with both Vardy and Barnes back in full action.
