The issue is this, I’m a pan-Africanist. Africa is my passion. And I see like, being over here in Europe, I have my own companies, I have done a lot. And I see that as long as we keep thinking. As long as you keep running away from what is disturbing us in Africa, we will never move forward,” said Orbitz. “I will say running is not a solution to a problem. Rather, you have to embrace the problem and write and I just think, Okay, let me do my own quota for humanity, and if this is a way of hearing my voice, then let me pass it out. It’s not been political. “If you listen to some part of that song. You will hear where I said some words that don’t have anything to do with being political, which is just, you know, this is something that happens in all ramifications of life. And I just tried to use it in my music. So that’s why I said it’s poetic, everybody lies.”
