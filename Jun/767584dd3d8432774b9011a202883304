We trekked from 8pm-5 am. We crossed through a river that almost reached us at chest level. They neither gave us food nor water to drink. It was a terrible experience.” The former NFF scribe said the kidnappers took them to an unknown destination in the forest where they stayed for almost three days without food or water. “They were young men in their 30s, who apart from starving us, prevented us from saying our prayers when it was time,” he added. Expressing gratitude, he said that the prayers of Nigerians and his family secured his release. Toro said he cannot ascertain whether a ransom was paid to secure his release or not, adding that he has forgiven his abductors.
