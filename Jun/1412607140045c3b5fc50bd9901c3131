The Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs and the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) are under the control of a “cartel” in Abuja, a group under the aegis of Ijaw Interest Advocates (IIA) aka Izanzan Intellectual Camp, has alleged. In a statement in Warri, at the weekend, the group called for intensified efforts to rescue the ministry and the interventionist agency. The statement, which was signed by the group’s National Coordinator, Arerebo Salaco Yerinmene SNR, claimed the Niger Delta area and people suffered untold hardship due to the shutdown of ongoing NDDC projects and non-payment of contractors. It said: “The development and economy of the people and region were greatly hampered as some forfeited personal properties for bank loans, some went to prison for inability to service bank loans, some developed High Blood Pressure (HBP) and died because of loans from banks.”   Addicto excited about fans love, teases new song     Makinde approves recruitment of fresh 500 Amotekun…     Ondo Assembly to review Amotekun law to tackle rising…   The group also alleged the “deceitful and wasteful” forensic audit was used to distract and deceive the Presidency and Nigerians, so as to facilitate “looting” and “fake emergency projects” in the NDDC. According to the IIA, business activities of the ministry and commission usually carried out in the Southsouth are in the “hands of the cabal hawks in Abuja, feasting on them as vultures”. “The Abuja cartel are like pirates in power who see NDDC and NDM as cash cows rather than developmental agencies used to calm an aggrieved people that had suffered age-long deprivation, unjustly”. Stating that “the struggle is not yet over,” the group said “we must go to the second phase which is to rescue NDDC and the Niger Delta Ministry back from Abuja, rewind them back to the Niger Delta for the purposes they were created”.
