We believe an artist needs to constantly, regularly create and recreate the music and the studio makes that an easy platform for them,” he said. Okusanya also admitted that the industry is large enough to accommodate all and sundry that are willing to impact society saying, “The music industry is a place of information, orientation, and sensitisation which sadly has positive and negative effects on both the message, conveyor (musician), and the receiver (audience). Our vision as a record label with a difference is to “breathe life into entertainment” with the mindset of channeling our artists in the right direction, which is to do good music with lyrics that will bless, motivate, encourage, inspire and challenge people towards greatness.”
