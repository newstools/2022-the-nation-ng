So, I call on all of you to raise the FIFA Green Card for the Planet and to record a short message, telling us what you will do to preserve the environment and save our world, and post this message on social media. Let’s engage on this!”   Lookman Leicester’s permanent move doubtful     Delta set to host NOC administrators course      Bale’s Wales beats Ukraine to clinch last Qatar 2022 ticket   The FIFA President called  everyone to support the campaign by preparing their own “Green Card for the Planet” video message where they mention an action that they will undertake to protect the environment while also requesting others to follow suit.
