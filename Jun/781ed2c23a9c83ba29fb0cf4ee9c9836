Gareth Bale is leaving Real Madrid as a free agent and could reunite with Jose Mourinho at Roma, claimed reports in Spain. The Wales international is out of contract after nine years at the Santiago Bernabeu and will turn 33 next month. He wants regular playing time ahead of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, which for the first time in over 60 years will have Wales as participants thanks to their play-off win over Ukraine. Bale has been linked with a return to the Premier League and Tottenham Hotspur, now under the guidance of Antonio Conte, while Getafe were also mentioned in Spain. According to El Nacional in Spain, Mourinho has personally contacted Bale to ask if he’d be interested in a new experience at Roma.
