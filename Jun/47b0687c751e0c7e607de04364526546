The hoarding of those dollars is the reason why it keeps skyrocketing. We want to contribute to our quota by first increasing the earning power of Nigerians because if an average Nigerian earns about $2000 dollars which is approximately N1.2million so imagine what they can do with that amount.” Speaking earlier, the CEO of TP Global FX, Nitish Sharma, said “Our ultimate mission is that any trader who is associated with us always earns out of his investments by trading himself using our different educational and monitoring services with a vision to strive to offer the best trading conditions to our clients using state of the art AI/ML-based trading experience.” Also speaking, Regional Marketing Manager, Vignesh Sundar on his part said they want Nigerians to know that they have the power to better their own lives not just to train them. “We are here to show them the resources to make their life better financially as well as their families too.”
