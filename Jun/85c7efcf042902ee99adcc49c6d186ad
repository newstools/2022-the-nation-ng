The Prelate of the Methodist Church in Nigeria, His Eminence Samuel Uche, yesterday said the church paid his abductors N100 million as ransom before they released him. The cleric said the church raised the sum and arranged it in five sacks of N20 million each before it was delivered to the abductors. The Prelate was abducted around 2 p.m on Sunday on the Enugu-Port Harcourt Expressway in Umu Nneochi Local Government Area of Abia State, alongside his chaplain, Very Rev. Abidemi Shittu, and the Bishop of Owerri, Rt. Rev. Dennis Mark. They were returning from a church programme in Okigwe, Imo State, and heading to Isuochi in Umu Nneochi.

Uche, who spoke in Lagos, said the church acted quickly after the abductors beat him up and threatened to kill him if the N100 million was not paid. The Methodist Church had, few hours after the abduction, appealed to the church’s faithful to raise the N100 million ransom. The Federal Government recently warned against the payment of ransom and the Senate also passed a Bill to amend the Terrorism (Prevention) Act, 2013, and sanction the payment of ransom to kidnappers. But the cleric said the Federal and state governments, the military and police did not intervene in the matter.
