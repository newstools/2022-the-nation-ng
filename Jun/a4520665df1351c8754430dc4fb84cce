Pan Yoruba socio-cultural group, Afenifere, yesterday renewed the call on Federal Government to allow the Southwest Security Network codenamed Amotekun Corps to carry sophisticated weapons. The group said the attack on St. Francis Catholic Church, Owo, Ondo State on June 5 would have been averted if Amotekun Corps had good weapons. Afenifere’s acting leader Chief Ayo Adebanjo renewed the call when he led a delegation of the group to on sympathy visit to Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu. He said the terrorists’ planned attack would have been detected if the state was in total control of security within its jurisdiction. The elder statesman described the attack as an affront on Yoruba land.

Akeredolu urged Afenifere to engage the All Progressives Congress presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, to factor the issues raised by the group into his programme when a new government comes on board next year. Also yesterday, another group – Yoruba Ronu – urged security agencies to fish out perpetrators of the attack and prevent reoccurrence in any party of the country. Its Chairman Prince Diran Iyantan said footages of the gruesome killing of slain children and women in their pool of blood were saddening.
