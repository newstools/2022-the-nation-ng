Ding dong ding dong Life’s bell rings In loyal obedience to the clock A metallic din rides the crest   Of a shimmering noon Ploughing through the shards Of a shy, uneasy day, aspects yet unclear As far as the ears can see   Our moon-old coins Have no time to shine in the sun Food prices mock their boast Their inflated conceit, their tasteless pretence       LIVE UPDATES: Ekiti Decides 2022     INEC declares Oyebanji Ekiti Gov-elect     Abuja-Kaduna train attack: We’re feeling suicidal, says man…   Shadows, hungry shadows Long, lean, lingering mists In the setting sun, dreadfully dark In the glare of the thirsty heat   What do we call Wardrobes without their robes How so loud the silence of those Who stay mute in the land of evil   Ding dong ding dong Life’s bell speaks in diverse accents But of what use are they In the country of the deaf?
