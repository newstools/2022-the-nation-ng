Flagging off the distribution of the materials,  SOKAPU President, Hon. Jonathan Asake said the relief materials were bought from the share of money it got from Rivers State governor Nyesom Wike’s N200 million donation to IDPs in Kaduna State. Governor Wike had, during his campaign tour to Kaduna State chapter of People’s Democratic Party (PDP) for presidential primaries election, announced a donation of the N200 million. Asake said the donation was shared between North and Southern Kaduna to the various IDPs camps across the respective regions of the State. However, the SOKAPU leader expressed disbelief that of all the 2023 presidential aspirants that came to Kaduna to campaign, it was only  Governor Wike, “from far away Rivers State that remembered the plight of IDPs in Kaduna State, particularly in Southern Kaduna”.
