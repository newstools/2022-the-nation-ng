Fast-rising singer Adelabu Alexander aka Magixx, has said his comment on Chris Brown’s latest song “Call me everyday” featuring Wizkid was misunderstood. On Sunday, Magixx in a now-deleted tweet, described the new song by the duo as ‘stupid’. He tweeted: “This new Chris Brown and Wiz is stupid.” Fans of the superstars especially Wizkid FC didn’t take the comment lightly as they continued to bash even him after the post was deleted. Following the continued trolls, the Mavins Records signee has lamented the hate he’s been receiving having been misunderstood thus, necessitating the need for a clarification. Clarifying his ‘stupid’ description of the song, the “Love Don’t Cost a Dime” singer noted he didn’t mean it literally but as a slang, ‘dope’, (meaning very good or amazing).

Why? I felt it was being misunderstood. “Then this morning woke up to so many hate comments on my IG post, which goes to show how desperate these blogs are for comments and likes. “I’m a music lover and if you check my history of tweets, I only tweet about music that I love. STUPID is a slang for Dope. “I didn’t know I was going to get people hating for hyping a song, the irony. We really need to be better people. I’m so sick from all of these. I’ll be attaching the dictionary meaning to this tweet once again for clarity,” Magixx wrote. He shared a screenshot from an online dictionary which described ‘stupid’ as a slang for ‘amazing’.
