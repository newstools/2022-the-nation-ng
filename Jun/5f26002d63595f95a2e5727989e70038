The Federal High Court in Lagos has struck out a suit by the Vice-Chancellor of the Federal University Oye Ekiti, Prof. Abayomi Sunday Fasina, following an out-of-court settlement with the police. Fasina had approached the court to challenge an alleged plan by the police to arrest him based on allegations of double salary, official misconduct and money laundering.  Justice Chukwujekwu Aneke struck out the suit after the police opted against pursuing the matter. He ruled that the suit be struck out since the parties agreed to discontinue it following an out-of-court settlement. Fasina filed the suit after men of the Special Fraud Unit (SFU), acting on a petition from the Global Anti-Corruption Initiatives (GAI), invaded the university on June 17, 2021, to arrest him. The incident created panic as members of staff and the university community were thrown into disarray as news spread that bandits invaded the campus.

The police and the SFU officials denied the allegations on the grounds that they were on campus to serve the Vice-Chancellor with an invitation for questioning over allegations of double salary, official misconduct and money laundering against him as contained in the petition by GAI. Fasina’s lawyer, Ebun Olu-Adegboruwa (SAN), insisted that the police indeed invaded the university to illegally “arrest and or kidnap him.” The SAN insisted that the allegations of double salary, official misconduct and money laundering by the GAI were not only spurious, untrue and unfounded but were trumped up to smear and defame the Vice-Chancellor’s character. After several proceedings and adjournments, the court struck out the matter.
