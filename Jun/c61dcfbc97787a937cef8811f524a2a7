Kylian Mbappe is reportedly ready to usher in the new era at PSG – by axing 14 people at the club. The starlet has recently committed his future to the French champions, after widespread interest from Champions League winners Real Madrid. In order to keep the 23-year-old in France, PSG chiefs have reportedly allowed him to have a say in matters behind the scenes, including in the transfer market. And it’s believed that the World Cup winner is ready to exercise that power by directing an exodus of 14 names.

Also on the list are key members of the squad such as Mauro Icardi, Julian Draxler, Pablo Sarabia, Leandro Paredes and Thilo Kehrer. Elsewhere, it is alleged that Danilo Pereira, Layvin Kurzawa, Juan Bernat, Colin Dagba and Sergio Rico are all on the chopping block at the Parc de Princes. The murmurs that Neymar may be in the firing line will come as some surprise to European football fans, who have seen a partnership develop between the Brazilian and Mbappe since 2017.

The Blues may be looking to make a statement signing as they begin their new era under the ownership of Todd Boehly’s consortium.
