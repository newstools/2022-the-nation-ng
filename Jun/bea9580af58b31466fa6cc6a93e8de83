The All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN) has said it would mobilise farmers ahead of the 2023 general elections to vote for leaders who will focus properly on the agricultural sector. AFAN in a statement made available to journalists by its National President, Arc. Kabir Ibrahim, said the association has resolved to vote only candidates who will carry farmers along after the general elections. He said: “It should be noted that AFAN under Arc. Kabir Ibrahim is mobilising farmers ahead of the 2023 general elections to vote for leaders who will focus properly on the Agricultural sector”.   ‘Nigerian political parties lack ideology’     Assembly candidate seeks massive votes for Tinubu     Coalition urges Benin monarch to abolish title   Speaking on the judgment of the Federal High Court in favour of the factional AFAN chairman, Faruk Rabiu Mudi, Kabir said the judgment has been appealed to and therefore he and his cohorts cannot parade themselves as the President and leaders of AFAN until the pending appeal is dispensed with. He noted that the duly elected executives of AFAN in the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) are coordinating the activities of farmers in their various states and the International Community is evidently working with the Arc. Kabir-led AFAN. According to him, the records of the Federal High Court have been compiled and transmitted to the Court of Appeal and files and case numbers have been  assigned. He, however, urged the federal government and the Federal  Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development( FMARD) as well as the general public to  follow due judicial process  and rule of law in transacting any business with anyone except Arc.Kabir Ibrahim and his National and State Executives regarding Nigerian farmers.
