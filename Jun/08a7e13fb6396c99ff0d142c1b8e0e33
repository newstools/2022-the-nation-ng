Around 2,000 people tried to enter the north African port town late on Friday, with around 500 gaining access after cutting through the fence, Spanish officials said in a statement. Initial reports said 13 people had died from their injuries after clashes with security forces, however, this was raised to 23 on Saturday night.   22 youths found dead in South African tavern     Ejeviome Otobo, missing ex-Nigerian  diplomat, found dead in…     UN chief expresses shock over reports of massacres in Mali   “Some fell from the top of the barrier [separating the two sides],” a Moroccan official said, adding that 140 security personnel and 76 migrants were injured. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez condemned the “violent assault,” which he blamed on “mafias who traffic in human beings.” Along with the other Spanish exclave of Ceuta, Melilla is a focal-point for migrants attempting to enter the European Union. Friday’s attempted crossing was the first since Spain and Morocco resumed diplomatic relations last month following a 15-month row over Madrid’s perceived support for the separatist Polisario Front.
