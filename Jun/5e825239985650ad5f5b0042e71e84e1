A member of the 9th National Assembly Shina Peller has dumped the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Peller, who announced his defection on Friday via his Twitter handle, noted he would be disclosing his new party on June 21, 2022. Sharing his reasons for defection, the lawmaker who represents Iseyin/Itesiwaju/Kajola/Iwajowa Federal Constituency, faulted the ruling party’s style of democracy in Oyo State. According to him, the democratic style is “one kills his conscience” and his continued stay in the party would see the people especially the youths perpetually at the mercy of those at the top.
