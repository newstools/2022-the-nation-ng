Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski has won the European Golden Shoe as the continent’s top scorer for the second year in a row. Lewandowski scored 35 Bundesliga goals in 2021/22, adding to his record-breaking 41-goal tally the previous campaign. The 33-year-old finished comfortably clear of Paris Saint-Germain’s Kylian Mbappe (28 goals), Lazio’s Ciro Immobile and Real Madrid’s Karim Benzema (both 27 goals) in the final pan-European scoring charts. Lewandowski’s goal-scoring exploits helped Bayern claim a 10th successive Bundesliga title, whilst handing him a fifth straight Bundesliga top scorer’s prize, and seventh overall – both records for outright wins. The reigning two-time Best FIFA Men’s Player also set Bundesliga best-marks for most single-season away (19) and calendar year goals (43).   11 Red Devils released from Old Trafford     EPL clubs set to splash cash in summer transfers     Christensen quits Chelsea ahead of Barca move   Lewandowski is the second Bayern player to win the European Golden Shoe, after the late Gerd Müller (1969/70 and 1971/72). As well as 35 Bundesliga goals, the current Bayern No.9 scored 13 times in the UEFA Champions League and twice in the DFL Supercup to make it a 50-goal campaign in all competitions. It represents the seventh season in a row in which Lewandowski has produced 40 or more goals. Only Lionel Messi (10) and Cristiano Ronaldo (eight) have hit the mark more often. His overall tally in a Bayern shirt, the club he joined from Bundesliga rivals Borussia Dortmund in summer 2014, reads 344 goals in 374 competitive matches. The Pole is the highest scoring non-German in Bundesliga history – and only second to the 365-goal Müller overall – with 312 strikes in 383 appearances.
