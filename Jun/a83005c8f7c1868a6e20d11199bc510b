Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, yesterday criticised the All Progressives Congress (APC) following reports that Senate President Ahmad Lawan was chosen as the consensus presidential candidate. Though the announcement by APC National Chairman was roundly repudiated, Atiku, in a statement, said the move was undemocratic. He said: “It needs no mention that whoever is handpicked as the APC presidential candidate in such a despotic process cannot be any different from the authoritarian fervour of the APC’s establishment. “Such a candidate, therefore, cannot represent the future of hope and brighter aspirations that Nigerians look forward to after the termination of the current state of anomie which the ruling party is known for. “It is important to stress once again that the 2023 general elections, more than anything else, is a referendum about the scorecard of the APC and Nigerians should not reward their failure with even a day more on the saddle.”   Pope Francis reacts to Owo church attack     Ikpeazu gives quit notice to herders, others in Abia forests     Eagles to give 100  percent against Leone Stars , says Aribo   Atiku carpeted the APC for holding its convention during work days. Atiku said: “If the charade that the APC calls a presidential convention primary election is merely to handpick an anointed candidate, it is important to ask the managers of the ruling party why they elected to slate the so-called convention for a working day, thereby disrupting economic activities around the Federal Capital Territory. “Even as delegates in the so-called election entered into the Federal Capital Territory, they must have been greeted with long queues of vehicles waiting to buy automobile fuel and darkness that continues to grim the capital city on account of seizures in electricity supply. “Should the APC delegates ask themselves what they have been brought to Abuja for, they should know that primaries of their party is not about any of the individuals vying for the presidential ticket of their party, but a referendum on the APC’s scorecard in the past seven years. “Should the delegates be honest with themselves about the current state of affairs in the country under the watch of their party, they ought to know that allowing the APC to remain in power one more day after May 29, next year is an unpatriotic decision to make. “For residents of the FCT who have been inundated with everyday stress as a result of bad governance by the ruling party, the choice of crucial working days – Monday and Tuesday – as days for the primaries of the APC is a callous and insensitive decision”.
