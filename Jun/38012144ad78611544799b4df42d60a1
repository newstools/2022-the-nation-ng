Lagos State Government yesterday set up a special squad to enforce the ban on commercial motorcycles in six councils and nine development areas. The government said the new squad will team up with the police to keep the bikers off all highways, major roads and bridges in the state. The ban is in line with the Transport Sector Reform Law (TSRL), 2018. Commissioner of Transportation Dr Frederic Oladeinde, who disclosed this during the inauguration of the squad, said the special anti-okada outfit will be reporting to the Police.
