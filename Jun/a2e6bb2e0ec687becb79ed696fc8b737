Curvy actress Nazo Ekezie has spoken against the condemnation of plastic butt by Nigerians. The actress, while reacting to recent statements by some of her colleagues, said not everyone has it all and it is only okay for people to fix their bodies the way they want. Ekezie noted the pressure placed on ladies by the society is far too much, which is why some ladies go under the knife.
