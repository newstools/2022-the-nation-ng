The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Osun says it has extended the collection of Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) in Osun ahead of the state governorship election on July 16. In a statement by the commission’s Public Affairs Officer, Mrs Oluwaseun Osimosu on Saturday, INEC said that the collection of PVCs had been extended to ease the collection of PVCs of voters that had yet to collect. “INEC wishes to inform the public, most especially all eligible voters who have yet to collect their Permanent Voter Cards that they can collect their PVCs at the registration areas (wards) from June 22 to June 26. “The collection would be between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. daily.
