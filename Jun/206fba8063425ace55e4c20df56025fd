A fresh leadership crisis is rocking the Labour Party (LP) and threatening the presidential dream of Peter Obi, former governor of Anambra State. Observers say the former PDP chief’s aspiration is shaky as his faction of the LP risks being declared illegal by the court. This is because a Federal High Court in Abuja has ordered that they and some of its executives be served with a fresh suit challenging the party’s leadership. Obi was surely not smiling the moment Inyang Ekwo, the presiding judge, gave the order while ruling on an ex parte motion filed by Calistus Okafor, a former deputy national chairman of the party. The court ordered that the service must be effected “within seven days of this order”. The matter was then adjourned till June 30 “for further mention”.   Delegates, beware     ‘My daughter’s killer tied her, slit her throat,…     Family‘s last moments with Nigerian female pilot of…   In the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/1636/2021, Okafor, who is a factional leader of the party, is challenging the legality of the leadership of Julius Abure and Akingbade Oyelakin, whom he said “represents persons wrongfully and unlawfully parading themselves as members of the National Working Committee (NWC) of Labour Party”. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is joined as the fourth defendant in the suit. The anxiety in Obi’s camp as we speak is occasioned by the fear of the unknown. What happens if his faction loses the case? Your guess is as good as mine.
