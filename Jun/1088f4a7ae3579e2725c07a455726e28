The price of the Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) otherwise known as petrol is yet to drop from N180 per litre in most of the retail outlets in Enugu State. The price, it was learnt, has remained stable in most filling stations since February. Checks by our correspondent as of Sunday in Enugu revealed that more filing stations hitherto not dispensing have joined the growing numbers of stations selling at between N175 and N180 per litre. While this had since affected the cost of transportation in the State, it was gathered the availability of the products reduced long queues formed in the many of the outlets owned by members of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) and the Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN) which sell N165 per litre.

Some motorists, who spoke with The Nation, said they had taken the situation like that. “Since the turn of the year 2022, there was never a day we bought fuel at N165 per litre except any day filling stations like the NNPC, Pinnacle, North-West, Oando among others have fuel. “You know that except North-West filling station, these other stations have fuel once or twice in a month in a month. “So, we rely on those ones that sell at N180 per litre. Before now, we were buying fuel N260 per litre and now the price seems to have remained permanent at N180. So far as we can afford to pay for it, we will keep managing,” one of the motorists said on Monday.
