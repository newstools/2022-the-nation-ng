The national president of the Actors Guild of Nigeria (AGN) Emeka Rollas has reacted to the arrest of one of its members, Moses Armstrong for allegedly raping a minor. Rollas described Armstrong’s case as a very serious and sad development. “This is a very sad development involving a member of ours, but I wouldn’t want to comment any further on this case,” he said. The AGN president said the accusation is not a welcome development and neither himself nor the association represent such alleged act. “To get involved with a child as young as 16 yrs is not something I and the association I represent, would stand for,” he said.
