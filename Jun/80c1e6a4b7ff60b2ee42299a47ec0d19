There was a protest yesterday in the Agemowo community of Badagry, Lagos, after two herdsmen hacked a man to death for allegedly knocking down a stray cattle. It was gathered that residents of the community took to the highways to register their angst over the murder of the young man, who they said was mistaken for the conductor of the commercial bus that killed the cow. Their protest was said to have grounded vehicular movement for several hours as vehicles moving to and fro Seme Border were forced to halt for a long time until the police and soldiers restored order. The herdsmen were said to have been leading their cattle in search of pasture when two strayed into the expressway around MTN Bus Stop and were hit by a speeding commercial bus.

Upon realising the trouble they had caused, the bus driver and his conductor were alleged to have fled the scene, only for the angry herders to attack the man said to be an innocent bystander. They allegedly stabbed him to death and tried to flee the scene afterwards but were prevented by irate residents with the help of some Lagos Neighbourhood Safety Corps (LNSC) who later handed them over to the police at Morogbo Division. Police spokesman Benjamin Hundeyin said: “A commercial vehicle ran into two cows this morning at Agemowo, Badagry, killing one of the cows. The two cattle herders attacked someone they mistook for the vehicle conductor, resulting in his death. “Angry residents blocked the highway in protest of the killing. The DPO, Morogbo Division, assisted by soldiers from 243 Recce Battalion, Badagry, successfully cleared the obstruction. “Normalcy has since returned to the area.”
