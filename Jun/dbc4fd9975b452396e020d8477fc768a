THE traditionalists have described the last Sunday’s gruesome murder of several Christian worshippers at the St. Francis Catholic Church in Owo, Ondo State, by unknown gunmen as a wake-up to all Nigerians to be firm in securing their communities. They insisted that “non-conventional and traditional methods” remain the only way to fight and drive away those attacking and killing innocent Nigerians in their communities. The traditionalists on the platform of the Ancient Religion Societies of African Descendants International Council (ARSADIC) said there was no doubt that the government had failed and could no longer secure the lives and property of Nigerians.
