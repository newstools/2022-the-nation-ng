Chelsea have been linked with a shock move for Cristiano Ronaldo after Todd Boehly reportedly held talks with agent Jorge Mendes. The 37-year-old is entering the final year of his contract with Manchester United and according to The Athletic, Ronaldo is concerned about the club not matching his ambition in the transfer window after a disappointing season. It’s claimed that new Chelsea owner Boehly held talk with Mendes in Portugal, with Ronaldo’s future and a potential move to Stamford Bridge one of the subjects discussed. The Telegraph similarly reports that Ronaldo has been offered to the Blues. United plan on keeping their star man and it is largely expected that he will remain at the club he loves, while it is not clear whether Chelsea will make a serious move for the striker.
