For long-term free agent Yaya Sanogo, his career wasn’t meant to end up the way it has. Next year marks a decade since a period that promised so much. In 2013, the French striker was nominated for the European Golden Boy award, the same year that saw him win the Under-20 World Cup with France and secure a dream move to Arsenal. Now 29 and the peak of his football years moving swiftly behind him, Sanogo has been without a club for the past 12 months, ever since his six-month stint at Championship club Huddersfield Town came to an end.

The pressure and the adrenaline of the weekend – I miss it, I miss the pitch.” Since he played his last Arsenal game in late 2014, Sanogo has had three uninspiring loan spells at Crystal Palace, Ajax and Charlton. The next 18 months brought about just 21 league appearances and three goals – all of which came in one match for the Addicks.
