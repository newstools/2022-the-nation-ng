At least 124 persons were killed in 50 cult clashes between January and June, according to the Nextier Violent Conflict Database report. It said the statistics showed an increase in cult wars compared to the 99 deaths recorded from 49 cult violence last year. The report titled “Cult wars in Nigeria,” and released June 14, said that Delta, Kwara, Bayelsa, Lagos and Ogun states were top five between January and May. It said: “Insights from the Nextier Violent Conflict Database indicate that cult violence is predominant in southern Nigeria.

Cult groups are readily available armed groups to be hired by people seeking to unleash terror in society.” To stem the tide of cultism, the group said a multi-sectoral and multi-stakeholder approach was required, adding that government must tailor kinetic measures to address the threats posed by cult activities to security of lives and investments. “In addition, policy measures are required to improve services such as rehabilitation centres as a non-forceful approach to cater to rehabilitation processes for members of cult groups in prison or those seeking therapy. “Government, civil society organisations, faith-based and cultural institutions must champion a value reorientation campaign to fight the prevalence of cultism. A multi-stakeholder approach is necessary to redefine social norms and values.”
