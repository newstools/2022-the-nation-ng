Senate Chief Whip Orji Kalu says he will work for the success of All Progressives Congress (APC), Presidential Candidate, Chief Bola Tinubu in the 2023 elections. Kalu told newsmen in Abuja on Wednesday that he would make for Tinubu, the same level of efforts he devoted to the Senate President Ahmad Lawan before and during APC’s presidential primary election. Kalu, who expressed satisfaction with the conduct and outcome of the primary election, said that he had anticipated that the party’s presidential candidate would emerge through consensus. He pledged to work toward Tinubu’s victory at the polls. Kalu, a former Governor of Abia, said that he was satisfied that the party held the primary poll. “The party would have been factionalised without the primary.   ‘Nigerians should focus on competence, character, not…     Will SDP, PDP truncate APC’s continuity agenda in…     Oyebanji, Kolawole, Oni in fierce battle for soul of Ekiti   “The next is to work for the APC and the APC candidate; we have no alternative. I am a party man and do not shy away from issues. ” Now, the way I fought for Lawan is the same way I will fight for Bola Ahmed Tinubu,” he said. He praised President Muhammadu Buhari for not endorsing any presidential candidate. The former governor expressed the optimism that the South East would vote for APC in 2023. ” I will always take my stand on any issue. I accepted that Bola Tinubu won and the whole party agreed. ”There is no doubt about his victory, and when there is no doubt about his victory, we just have to go to the field to work for our party’s victory. “I pray that my constituency, the South East, will give us the same belief that they gave to President Buhari in 2019, which gave him 68 per cent votes. ”I hope they will be able to give APC the same number of votes,” Kalu said.
