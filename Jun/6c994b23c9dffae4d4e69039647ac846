Actor Stanley Nweze has stated women who enjoying fixing long nails cannot be considered wife materials. He made this known while advising prospective husbands on what to look out for when choosing a woman for a wife. Nweze argued most of these ladies with extra-long nails cannot cook, wash and aren’t homely because; homely girls don’t engage in such. He wrote: “Before you choose a wife to marry rule out women who love making “over long nails”, most of them can’t cook or wash. “Trust me on this.. Homely girls don’t do that..” His opinion certainly got him some trolls as he went hard on them, telling them to quit sending him ‘rubbish Dms’ and rather go secure their PVCs for the coming 2023 general elections. The actor also took the time to inform his attackers that he’s pretty great at cleaning and a fantastic cook, which is why he loves a lady who knows how to cook and generally domesticated.

I wasn’t even talking about myself to start with. Just that I had this conversation with a friend earlier and decided to share. “But if you come to me, I am a fantastic cook, as a matter of fact, I love to cook. So somehow, I love I love women who can cook too. “But forget about me for a second. As a girl, can you do your laundry or cook with extremely long nails?”, he quizzed. “The answer is capital “NO”. So, in a nutshell if you are always on long nails, it simply means you hardly get involved in domestic activities. “Personally, I can do better all-round so, I won’t even settle for less. And also, I also know most men love domestic women. So, I’m just sharing a warning sign. “Meanwhile, use this energy y’all are using to attack me to get your PVC,” he added.
