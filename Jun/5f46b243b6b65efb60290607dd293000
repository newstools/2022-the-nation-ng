Singer G-Kross aka Baba has announced plans to hold a follow-up musical concert in Calabar, Cross River State after the successful launch of his debut album ‘Son of a lion.’ On his debut album, singer said: “It was launched online last month on several music apps such as Spotify, Boomplay, Audiomack among others.” G-Kross expressed gratitude to fans, family as well as critics whose advice and criticism made it possible for his dreams to be actualised. According to him, his debut album was a huge success, noting the song explains his real life story.
