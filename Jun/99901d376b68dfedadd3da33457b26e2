Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, has called on African writers to raise critical minds that will reduce the spate of insurgency, extremism, and coups in the continent. He stated that for decades, the African continent has witnessed several incidences of civil wars and insurgencies, noting that in recent years, it has also witnessed several coups d’états in some countries, including Burkina Faso, Chad, Guinea, Mali, and Sudan. The Continent is also dealing with security challenges from terrorist groups such as Boko Haram, and ISWAP in the Sahel region.
