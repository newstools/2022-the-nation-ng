The main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ekiti State may perform poorly in today’s governorship election. This has been attributed to poor funding by critical stakeholders of the party. Besides poor funding, some residents in Ado-Ekiti, the state capital, said the battle in today’s poll is between the All Progressives Congress(APC) and the Social Democratic Party (SDP). Mr. Olufemi, a bartender, simply said:”The PDP is finished in Ekiti State. It is either the APC or the SDP and you know people are hungry.”   ‘Rivers youths’ clash with PHEDC cause of Bayelsa power…     Gunmen kill policeman, burn patrol vans in Nsukka     Terrorists kill security personnel, three others in Niger…   Another resident who gave his name as Kola, said he would decide who to vote for when he got to the polling unit. It was gathered that the cancellation of the final grand rally of the PDP dealt a big blow to chances of the party’s candidate, Bisi Kolawole. A member of the Ekiti PDP who pleaded anonymity said the outcome of the party’s presidential primary where Governor Nyesom Wike lost out was responsible for the fate of the party in Ekiti. He said the party would be going into today’s election ‘on sheer hope.’
