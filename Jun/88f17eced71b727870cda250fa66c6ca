Nottingham Forest are reportedly looking elsewhere this summer which has seen them cool their interest in Rangers ace Joe Aribo. According to the Daily Record, Domen Crnigoj, a midfielder from Venezia, is edging closer to joining the newly-promoted Premier League club. While the 23-year-old Gers utility man is still on their radar, he is no longer their priority in this transfer window. If Forest end up getting their desired player then interest in Aribo could be all but over for them which is good news for Gers. They have a billionaire owner and will be backed by additional Premier League revenues which they will look to make the most of in order to stay in the division.

At Forest, their goals will be 17th  place for higher while at Ibrox, the 23-year-old will target a league win and a run in Europe which could even lead to a title. He must pick and choose the right club for himself and not just jump ship at the first Premier League side that shows an interest in him. While Gers fans would hate to lose him, they know that he’s doing it to further his ambitions and the Ibrox faithful will not hold that against him. Also, Aston Villa have dropped out of the race to sign Rangers midfielder Joe Aribo, according to reports in Birmingham. The Express and Star claimed that Steven Gerrard is not interested in bringing the in-demand Nigerian to Villa Park.
