Former Niger State Governor Babangida Aliyu said the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, did not pick Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike as his running mate because of his temperament. He also said that 2023 would be too early for the Labour Party (LP) candidate, Mr. Peter Obi to become president. Aliyu claimed the Rivers’ helmsman “insulted his way to power”. Speaking during an interview on a Channels Television programme monitored by The Nation, said: “You do not go around choosing people that will not compliment you.   Sanwo-Olu heads 86-man Campaign Council for Osun…     Lagos renews commitment to renewable energy     ‘Fed Govt produced 625,000 passports in five…   “You choose people who will compliment your office. People that are ready to take over from you and will make you comfortable. “Unfortunately, I don’t know if it is his temperament. Sometimes when you speak too much. When you insult your way to power, it does not always happen. “I can count many people who he has insulted. People will say he is always speaking his mind. But there are times you don’t need to speak your mind.” On the chances of Peter Obi, Aliyu said, “Peter Obi is my good friend and a former member of my former Governors forum. A very excellent person; his candidature, in terms of the presidency, – I think he will make some name now. But he may be able to make it only in 2027, 2031. But 2023 is too early.” “Even though the young people might go for him, the name is not dropping everywhere else. I doubt if Nigerians are ready for him now as a presidential person. “I would have loved him as a Vice President. Many of us were rooting for him to be Vice President to Atiku again.”
