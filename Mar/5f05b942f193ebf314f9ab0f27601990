Veteran actor Pete Edochie has stated age is more than a number. He expressed immense gratitude to God for attaining 75. In an interview with Ada Karl TV shared on his Instagram page, the legendary actor faulted the popular cliché on ‘age.’ According to Edochie, anyone who believes age is just a number should undergo psychiatric evaluation for as people get older they feel it within themselves even though they may try to downplay it. The thespian said: “75, that’s not a small age. How does it feel being 75? You know, I have heard a lot of people say that age is just a number.

Most of my colleagues who started with me are no longer here, may their souls rest in peace. Continuing; Edochie said: “It is not easy being 75, you are assailed by all types of medical challenges, but you just have to keep keeping on. “And I’m happy that my faculties are still complete. So once more, I thank the Almighty God.”
