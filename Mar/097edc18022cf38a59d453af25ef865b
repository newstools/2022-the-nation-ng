Anthony Joshua already has a three fight offers if Oleksandr Usyk delays their rematch. Usyk dethroned AJ of the WBA, IBF and WBO unified titles with a 12-round masterclass last September. The pair are signed to an immediate rematch but the Ukrainian, 35, has bravely taken up arms to defend his nation in the war against Russia. Joshua, 32, has respected Usyk’s situation but it could see their rematch shelved. And both he and promoter Eddie Hearn confirmed they will be open to an interim bout in the meantime if needed. Otto Wallin, the man he left Tyson Fury with 47 stitches in 2019, was the first to throw his name into the hat as a southpaw alternative. “If you look at Usyk and you’re trying to find someone that’s similar to him, obviously I’m the best option.

His manager His manager Jay Jimenez said: “Luis ‘King Kong’ Ortiz would love an opportunity to step up to the challenge of facing Joshua.” Ortiz was in a similar situation in 2019 when Jarrell Miller, 33, was pulled from fighting Joshua after three failed drug tests. But he turned down £7million to instead chase a rematch with Wilder, 36, which he lost by knockout, his second to the American. A more wildcard alternative is Joshua’s former Team GB sparring partner Joe Joyce, 36. Joyce tweeted: “Two GB Lions in an all British Heavyweight Showdown!  “This fight would be massive. I’m highly ranked and undefeated. Let’s Get It!”
