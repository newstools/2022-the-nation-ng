The Shepherd-in-charge of Celestial Church of Christ, Genesis Global, Israel Oladele Ogundipe, has secured the release of over 82 inmates from the Kirikiri Maximum Correctional Centre, Lagos. Ogundipe, also known as Israel Genesis, raised a team of lawyers to facilitate their release. One of the inmates, Azeez Ibraheem, said he was detained for 10 years and six months. He said he was arrested in 2010 for no crime at Oshodi while returning from work. He said: “I was picked up in 2010 when some thugs were fighting at Oshodi. From there, the police officers moved us to SARS office.

After two years, I was moved to Maximum Prison. “In 2015, there was a case of one Azeez Ibrahim. The charges were read and I was accused of living in Ikorodu and participating in a robbery incident. “I told them it was a case of wrong identity. The prosecutor later agreed that the accused only bears the same name as me and said he would produce the real suspect. The alleged crime was committed in 2014 while I was still in prison. “Prophet Ogundipe is like my angel that secured my release by employing a competent lawyer for me.” Another inmate, David Godfrey, said he spent nine years in the correctional centre.
