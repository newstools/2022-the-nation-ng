Music streaming giant Spotify has announced Fave as the latest Equal Africa ambassador of March. This announcement comes off the back of Fave’s popularity and fame since the release of her breakthrough hit single, ‘Baby Riddim’ in September 2021 under emPawa Africa. The 22-year-old burgeoning Nigerian Afro R&B singer expressed delight with the announcement while making a case for female singers and artists. “It’s easy to come across, or even be directly involved in, a conversation on the subject of female artists and the widely believed stereotype that women cannot give their 100% to music because there are other things that occupy their time, based on societal norms. Like family and kids.”   Oshara releases new single     Lady Donli: Sacrifice I made for my music     Onos Morgan goes for gold in Italy   Continuing, Fave said, “Stereotypes like this already in?uence how people in the industry view women. On a broader scale, you almost get the vibe that people think the success of a female artist can only be short-lived. Of course, defects like this are not general but they do exist. Male domination, I believe, is something that can only be ?ltered away by our outstanding success as women in our ?elds of excellence and talent. I’m honored to be part of the EQUAL programme with women who plan to change the world.” Fave joins the Equal programme’s list of ?erce African women making waves in music, as part of its bid to foster gender equality and provide a platform to celebrate in?uential female artists in Africa. “Our aim with the Equal Music Programme is to shine a light on remarkable young women in Africa who are ?nding their feet through music,” says Spotify’s head of music for sub-Saharan Africa, Phiona Okumu. “We remain committed to leveling the playing ?eld for female creators by giving emerging and established artists equal opportunities on our platform. Fave exudes character and con?dence and we are proud to showcase her.”
