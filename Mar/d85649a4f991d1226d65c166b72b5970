UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday said the United Kingdom cannot impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine. Johnson, in a press conference in Warsaw, said it would lead to a direct military confrontation with Russia and the consequences would be truly very difficult to control. He said unfortunately the implication of imposing a no-fly zone was that the UK would be engaged in shooting down Russian planes. “We would be engaged in direct combat with Russia and that´s not a thing that we can do or that we have envisaged,” he said.
