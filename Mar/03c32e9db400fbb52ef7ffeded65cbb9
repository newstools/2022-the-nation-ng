Super Eagles interim head coach Austin Eguavoen has confirmed that the duo of Innocent Bonke and Samuel Chukwueze are still under close observation ahead of tonight’s 2022 FIFA World Cup playoffs tie against Black Stars of Ghana in Abuja. The two players started the first leg tie at the Baba Yara Stadium, Kumasi before they were substituted after they got injured and Eguavoen told journalists that both players didn’t  take part in the training sessions had after their return to Nigeria and as such may have cast doubt on their participation in tonight’s game. He said  their fitness level would be assessed with a decision made on their availability or otherwise before the start of the game but he assured that the technical crew won’t be taken any risks ok both players.

Chukwueze’s scan result hasn’t come while Innocent Bonke didn’t participate in this (yesterday) evening training because he had a knock,” Eguavoen told journalists. “Our medical team is still working on them. It is 24 hours before the game. We are not going to risk anything. I am expecting the result   of Chukwueze’s scan and we shall make a decision on his availability or otherwise. We have others  in the team that can do the job.” Meanwhile,  Eguavoen has urged the Super Eagles  to convert the chances that come their way tonight against Ghana. “Score more goals. Opportunities rarely come in top game like this but when you get it, take it. Ghana played very well. Every chance we get tomorrow we must make it count,” Eguavoen told journalists.
