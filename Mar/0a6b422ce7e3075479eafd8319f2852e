Let fame be the added advantage, come because you are passionate about acting, come because you are passionate about the industry, come because you are passionate about storytelling, a need for change because that’s what Nollywood is. The need to tell life-changing and transforming stories that will, in turn, transform the society, let that be your goal and then let fame be added on to it,” he said. Stan Nze became prominent with his role as ‘Ohakanu’ in Tinsel and for his lead role in Rattlesnake (The Ahanna story).
