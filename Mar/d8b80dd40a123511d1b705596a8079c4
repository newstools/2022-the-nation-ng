Billionaire heiress Florence Otedola aka DJ Cuppy has apologised to her dad Femi Otedola for pranking him. The disc jockey shared a video of the prank in her father’s office in his London mansion. She is seen in the office pretending to assist her dad with work. She stylishly bends and places a real-looking rat under his table. Moving away from the table, Cuppy screams, pointing at the object under the table.

But Cuppy laughed excitedly that her prank was successful. The 59-year-old business mogul became pissed after he heard his daughter laughing and jumping excitedly. Seeing her dad’s reaction, the “Gelato” singer made an apology post with the image of a smiling rat. The post reads: “Please forgive me @femiotedola.”
