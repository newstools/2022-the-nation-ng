African Union’s candidate, Gilbert Houngbo has emerged as Director-General of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) at the March 25, 2022 election which took place in Geneva, Switzerland. The Togolese scored 30 votes to beat his closest rival and former French Labour and Social Development Minister, Ms Muriel Penicaud who scored 23 votes, in a tension-soaked contest at the 334th session of the ILO Governing Board. A former Korean Foreign Minister Kyang-wha Kang came a distant third with two votes.

I recall that when he visited Nigeria on February 26, 2022 to canvass for votes, I assured that Africa was in the race to win and we have won,” Ngige said in a statement by Acting Head of Press and Public Relations of the ministry, Patience Eke. It added: “Sen Ngige had led the African lobby for Houngbo when no clear winner emerged in 1st round of voting. With this development, Houngbo becomes the third African to occupy the Director Generalship/ Chief Executive of a United Nations’ body after World Health Organisation’s Dr. Tedros Ghebreyesus of Ethiopia and Nigeria’s Ngozi Okonjo Iweala of the World Trade Organisation. “The ILO is the prime and oldest United Nations body looking after the tripartite of Workers, Employers and Government since formation in 1919.”
