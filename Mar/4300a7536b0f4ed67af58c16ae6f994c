Operatives of Delta State Police Command have arrested one Morrison Okomor in connection with the murder of his girlfriend, Miss Tega Okpako.

They claimed their daughter was killed by the suspect for ritual purposes. A family source said, “We were surprised when we saw her body at FMC with a very deep hole on her forehead suggesting an attack because such a hole cannot be as a result of a fall. Tega is not known to be violent and how can she get drunk, then suddenly fall down and die just like that?” Police spokesman Bright Edafe confirmed the incident.
