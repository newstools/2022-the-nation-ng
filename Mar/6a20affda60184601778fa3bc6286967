NATIONAL Rescue Movement (NRM) has said the party is not desperate to be in power, but to fix Nigeria. The party noted that it is desperate to move Nigeria to a strong position where it can  compete favourably among nations. NRM’s Board of Trustees Chairman Senator Saidu Muhammed Dansadau, who spoke at the National Convention of the party in Abuja yesterday said its main objective is to save the nation from being derailed. He noted that Nigerians have a role to play in changing the narrative by identifying and spurning the bad eggs among those bent on undermining good governance and wellbeing of the people. Noting that the party is advocating peaceful election, Dansadau said the welfare, safety and security of Nigerians is more important than any other thing.   200 women for U.S Consulate training     Institute seeks financial inclusion for youths, women     Association condemns attack on activist   The party’s Caretaker Committee National Chairman  Usman Abubakar Jikamshi called on all other credible opposition parties to come together to rescue Nigeria.
