Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA) on Monday asked the National Assembly to clamp down on the monopoly of South African digital satellite television, MultiChoice. HURIWA, at a briefing by its National Coordinator, Emmanuel Onwubiko in Abuja, condemned the recent increase in the prices of the cable company’s DStv and GOtv packages in Nigeria. The group also faulted MultiChoice’s obstinate refusal in charging Nigerians per view as done all over the globe, including in South Africa, the parent country of digital television. Onwubiko urged the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed and concerned government agencies, including the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to compel MultiChoice to charge Nigerians per view or wield its big stick on the company for compliance failure.   Bandits didn’t shutdown Kaduna Airport, we killed 12 of them…     Alleged defamation: 40-year-old remanded for Facebook post…     Alleged kidnapping: Judge fumes as Evans, co-defendant’s…   HURIWA further alleged that the South African company, which has been operating in Nigeria for about three decades has been clandestinely conniving with security agents to witch hunt indigenous Nigerian competitors who dare attempt to break the monopoly of MultiChoice. HURIWA’s Onwubiko said: “The recent hike in prices of Multichoice’s DStv and GOtv packages in Nigeria is outrageous and should be reversed with immediate alacrity before April 1, 2022 commencement date for the new price regime. “The South African company has also used unfair competitive strategies to force indigenous Nigerian competitors to close shop. The case of cable television firm, Telcomm Satellite TV, is still fresh in mind”.
