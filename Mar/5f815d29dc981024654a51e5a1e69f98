PurerVita has announced the launch of PurerMama, a nutritional and wellness brand founded by a leading award-winning United Kingdom obstetrician to revolutionise pregnancy supplements. The products are formulated for pregnancy, breastfeeding and postnatal recovery.   Eleven cases of vaccine-derived poliovirus detected, says…     ‘Traditional medicine remains a veritable tool for health,…     Soft drinks strongly linked to osteoporosis in children–…   The team includes a paediatrician, psychologist and obstetrician with decades of experience in treating women taking pregnancy supplements but who still experienced deficiencies. Frustrated at the lack of an innovative pregnancy supplement, which was up to date with research and met the needs of the mothers, they decided to create their own and developed this in line with new research. Their fundamental approach was to recognise work in the field of epigenetics – the study of what nutritional components switch on healthy genes in pregnancy. The brand was inspired after the obstetrician started an online antenatal course called PRISM (Preparation, Recovery, Inspiration and Support for Motherhood) during the COVID pandemic and taught thousands of mums who were isolated and needed a trusted source of right information. The mums were interested the most about nutritional gaps including articles on ‘Are we missing a choline supplement crisis in the UK? (BMJ)’. Out of the pandemic came a focus from both doctor and mothers to maximise health in pregnancy and the fourth trimester.
