The Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) has created the Directorate for Politics and Governance ahead of the 2023 general elections. The church, in a memo, said the newly-created Directorate is to coordinate the affairs and activities of members interested in seeking political offices in 2023. The RCCG also announced the appointment of Pastor Timothy Olaniyan, a Pastor in Charge of Province (PICP) Lagos Province 12 as head of the Directorate. It directed pastors at regional, state, zonal, and all other levels to appoint officials to coordinate the new directorate at such levels.

F. Odesola. The memo reads in part: “We write to formally notify you that the mission authority has created the Office of Directorate of Politics and Governance in the RCCG. Further to this, Pastor Timothy Olaniyan (PICP Lagos Province 12) has been appointed to lead the office. “You are kindly requested to appoint with immediate effect a Provincial Officer for your province and also ensure that the same is done at all levels of the church – zone, area and parish. The essence of this directorate is to help coordinate the engagement of our people who are willing to be involved in politics as well as mobilise support for them when required. “The details of those nominated to coordinate the activities of the directorate are to be forwarded to the Office of the Assistant General Overseer (Admin/Personnel) of the RCCG.” The memo has generated many debates on social media with some questioning whether it is appropriate for a church to coordinate activities and mobilise for members willing to join politics.
