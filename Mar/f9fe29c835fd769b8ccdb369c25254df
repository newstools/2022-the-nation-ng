Filmmaker Mildred Okwo has argued fame can be intoxicating such that people will do anything to be in the limelight. In a recent tweet, she wrote: “Fame can be intoxicating so people will sometimes result to crazy stuff to be in the limelight.”   Age not just a number, says Pete Edochie at 75     You can’t love Wizkid , Davido equally- Cubana Chief Priest     DGN strengthens ties with MultiChoice Nigeria   She went further to stress the need for regular mental health evaluation saying, ‘Plastic surgery can be very addictive and once you start, sometimes you can’t stop. Regular mental health evaluation is important to check potentially harmful addictions.” Okwo also opined that cinema distribution in Nigeria is at a primitive stage. “The cinema distribution in Nigeria is at a primitive stage in my humble opinion. Not only do we not have enough cinemas, the ones we even have, but our film distributors also are unable to aggressively market or even monitor sales and promotions.”
