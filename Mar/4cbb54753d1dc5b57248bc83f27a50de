As the Federal Government commences the evacuation of stranded Nigerians from war-torn Ukraine, President Muhammadu Buhari has assured his administration will continue to defend the interest of Nigerians wherever they may be. Buhari made this assertion Thursday in Nairobi, Kenya at a townhall meeting with a group of Nigerians resident in the country. According to a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr Femi Adesina, Buhari said his administration had risen up to its responsibility of looking out for distressed Nigerians and their welfare, wherever they are. According to him: “On our part as a Government, we shall continue to defend the interests of all Nigerians wherever they may be. We have demonstrated this over time, as we have had cause to evacuate our citizens in harm’s way abroad.

Buhari, who was represented at the event by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffery Onyeama, reiterated that it was the determination of the current administration to forge a partnership with the ‘Ambassadors-at large’ towards building the country together that led to the establishment of the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NiDCOM).   He expressed delight that the Commission had been engaging the Diasporans and had also come up with laudable programmes that would appeal to them.
