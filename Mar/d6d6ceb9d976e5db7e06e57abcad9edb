FORMER District (9110) Governor, Rotary International, Dr. Deinde Shoga has explained that the group often raises funds to supplement the dues paid by members to execute major projects which ordinarily they have found difficult to do or embark upon. Speaking at a fund raiser dinner/awards organised by the Rotary Club of Onigbongbo, Shoga, said such funds are normally channelled as counterpart funds to major projects and programmes. Shoga, who is the Regional Rotary Foundation (RRF) Coordinator, Region 22, explained that District 9110, which has contributed over $2million to the fund, has got over $5million from it to complete its projects.
