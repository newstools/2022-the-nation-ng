The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has said it will not extend the registration deadline for the 2022 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) and the Direct Entry (DE). The board said this in a statement by its Head of Information and Protocol, Dr. Fabian Benjamin, yesterday in Abuja. The statement said: “The ongoing 2022 UTME/DE registration exercise scheduled to end on March 26, 2022 would not be extended. This is because the time scheduled for the registration exercise – from February 19, to March 26, 2022 – is the only window allotted by relevant authorities to the board to conduct the exercise. “It should be noted that registration and examination dates are not fixed arbitrarily but through a consensus of opinions of the Federal Ministry of Education and examination agencies.   30,000 insurgents, family members surrender in Northeast,…     Women will get greater roles in inclusive governance, says…     PDP’s NEC meeting to hold March 15   “Hence, before the commencement of registration or examination for any given year, all public examination bodies are invited to a roundtable where they are expected to agree on the timetable of activities for each examination agency and which must be strictly adhered to. “This announcement is necessary because of the drop in the number of candidates coming forward to register, in spite of the capacity of the board to register more daily. “By this announcement, the board is urging prospective candidates who desire to register for the 2022/23 UTME/DE to come out to register as they have only two weeks to do so, while no extension would be granted after the close of registration.” “The general public is to note that it is practically impossible for the board to even contemplate any extension of registration as sister examination bodies, such as WAEC, NECO and NABTEB, have their allotted time, which the board cannot usurp.”
