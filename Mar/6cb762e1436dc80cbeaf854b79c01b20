Hoarders of petrol in filling stations and those who sell above the pump price will face serious sanctions, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Ltd warned yesterday. Speaking at a joint press briefing with Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN), Depot and Petroleum Products Marketers Association of Nigeria (DAPPMAN) and Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG), the Group Managing Director of the NNPC, Mele Kyari, said there was no plan to adjust the pump price of petrol. Kyari warned filling stations selling above the approved regulated price of between N162 and N165 per litre to desist from such practice, warning that the NNPC will sanction any marketer inflating the price of PMS.
