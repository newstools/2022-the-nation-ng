Mikel Arteta believes Arsenal are ‘still far away’ from reaching the vision he had for the club when he took over in December 2019. Arteta said the process is ongoing, and the gap with where he wants to be is still big. “I think we are much closer than we were, and probably the closest that we have been in terms of what we are looking for. But I focus on that gap. And that gap is still big.

We can be more adaptable, we can be much more unpredictable, we can have much more flexibility and we can be much more consistent throughout games to maintain that level.” “We don’t have any single player or any single member of staff in the organisation that can do it individually, all by themselves so it has to be a collective drive to get that bit extra and one of those main factors, for me, has been the Emirates and our supporters. How much they are giving to the team, it’s difficult to put a number on it but I’m telling you it’s been one of the biggest parts.” Arteta added that he didn’t want to use off-the-field drama as an excuse for the previous form and that the club can learn from previous mistakes.
