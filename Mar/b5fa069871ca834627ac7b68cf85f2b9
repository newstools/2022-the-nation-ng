World’s oldest tennis player, 97, staying in Ukraine and “not afraid of anyone” A 97-year-old Ukrainian man, who is the world’s oldest tennis player, is refusing to evacuate the war-torn city of Kharkiv following Russia’s invasion, insisting that he’s “not afraid of anyone”. Leonid Stanislavskyi, who knocked up with 21-time Grand Slam winner Rafa Nadal last year, is staring death in the face as Putin’s forces continue to bomb his home-town, located just a few miles from the Russian border. Stanislavskyi’s family have been urging him to flee the country, but he says he wants to stay and see out the conflict – not least so he can get back to playing tennis again.

But I decided to stay here. If I could get [to Poland] I would play there. But I decided to stay at home and wait for the end of the war. “I have bad hearing so I sleep at night and don’t hear anything. Last night there were bombings, in the morning there were air-raid sirens again. “I hope I live to reach 100. I have to survive this frightening situation,” he stressed. “The war started on [February] 24th. From the 24th till now I have practically not gone out. I’ve stayed at home… I have supplies, the fridge is full. I’m sitting at home, not going anywhere.
