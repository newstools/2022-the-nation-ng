Rivers Governor Nyesom Wike has declared his readiness to obey any decision reached by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on zoning. Wike, who recently declared his interest to contest the presidential ticket of his party, however disagreed with other aspirants, who claimed that there was no zoning in the party. Quoting a relevant section of the PDP’s Constitution on zoning, Wike insisted that it was selfish for anybody in PDP to deny the arrangement because of his ambition. The Governor, who spoke on Channels TV on Monday evening as a guest of Focus Nigeria, said the founding fathers of the PDP knowing the complexities and diversities in the country made the provision. On whether the argument on zoning should apply to PDP since the last President on the platform of the party hailed from the Southsouth, Wike said such argument do not hold water adding that zoning applied to the entire country and not to a party.

I won’t contest if they zone it to the north”, he said, adding that he had been a loyal party man since 1998. The Governor said he had no other party to run to and that explained the reason he usually took any action geared towards the destruction of the PDP personal. Wike further took exemption to the argument that no PDP candidate from the South would match another Southern candidate of the APC. He said the results of the past elections showed that the PDP had most of the votes from the South recalling that in the last election, APC could not get 25 per cent votes in Rivers.
