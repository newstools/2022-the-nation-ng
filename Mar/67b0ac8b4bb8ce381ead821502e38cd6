Abubakar Bello of Niger, who was the acting chairman, remained valid and binding. “I duly transmitted power to His Excellency the Niger state Governor, Muhammed Sani Bello. “ Therefore, all actions and measures taken by the committee under his leadership as acting chairman, remain valid and binding,” he said.
