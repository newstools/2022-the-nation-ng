A man in Adamawa State has confessed to being a member of a gang of kidnappers, which collected N12 million ransom from two victims. Sadu Bunkawu indicated to the police that he fell out with his gang after it gave him just N200, 000 out of the N12 million they made from their last operation. Describing his share as too meagre by his gang, he reported them to the police to correct the injustice. The 28-year-old Bunkawu of Filingo village in the Jada Local Government Area of Adamawa State disclosed that the N12m ransom was paid to them when they abducted Umaru Diffiwa and Umaru Babidi of the same community. He expressed the regret that the operation was indeed a bad one for him because even the N200,000 he collected got lost on his way back home.   2023: RCCG sets up Directorate for politics     Those unhappy with happenings in APC should leave –…     MC Oluomo, Lagos NURTW withdraw from national body   “I lost my share of the money while rushing to reach home on time,” Bunkawu said. “The money was paid to seven of us by the family members of the victims.

The Adamawa State Police Command arraigned Sadu Bunkawu before Chief Magistrate Court I in Yola on a charge of criminal conspiracy and kidnapping. When the First Information Report was read and interpreted to him in court, he pleaded guilty. After the plea, the police prosecutor prayed the court to adjourn the matter to enable him to complete the investigation and take the case file to the Department of Public Prosecutions for legal advice. The judge, Muhammad Abdullahi, adjourned the case to next month, April 4.
