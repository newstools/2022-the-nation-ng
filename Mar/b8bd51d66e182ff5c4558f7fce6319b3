Victor Osimhen has insisted that Napoli can still win Italy’s Serie A this season after netting the brace in Napoli’s 2-1 away win over Verona yesterday Napoli’s title hopes suffered a setback last week as Luciano Spalletti’s men fell to a 1-0 home defeat to AC Milan. But the Nigeria international put his side back on the title track with an excellent match-winning performance The 23-year-old scored Napoli’s goals at the Stadio Bentegodi to give his team victory, the first a header in the 14th minute despite putting on a protective mask and the second a tap-in from Giovanni Di Lorenzo’s squared pass into the box in the 71st minute.   Spalletti hails red-hot Osimhen     Havertz’s goal seals late win for Chelsea against…     Ronaldo treble settles Man United, Tottenham thriller   “I think after the defeat to Milan everyone was upset, so we went into a difficult ground against an organised team with determination and desire to win, it’s a deserved win,” the striker told DAZN after the game.“Like I always say, we have to continue to win. In order to win the Scudetto, we must try to win every game this season. Today was a step towards our objective and I believe we can do it.” The tap-in ended a run of four consecutive headed goals for Osimhen, who has been working on this part of his game, especially after wearing a protective mask for a facial fracture. “I have been doing some practice in training, Mario Rui and Di Lorenzo helped me with some crosses. I wanted to have more confidence with my head, it is really important to me and I want to continue like this,” Osimhen added.
