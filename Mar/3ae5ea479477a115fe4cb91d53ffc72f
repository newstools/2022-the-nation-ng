Former Bayelsa Governor Seriake Dickson and his Benue counterpart Samuel Ortom have picked nomination forms for the Senate. Also Adamawa Governor, Ahmadu Fintiri is asking for a return ticket to return to office in 2023. They are all seeking the tickets of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). While Ortom is seeking to represent his Benue North-West senatorial district from 2023, Dickson is seeking to retain his Bayelsa West district seat which he presently occupies. Political leaders from Bayelsa’s Sagbama/Ekeremor local government area, had on Tuesday, stormed the PDP Abuja secretariat to pick the form for Dickson.

Ogbere expressed optimism that Dickson will continue to offer the Niger Delta state quality representation. The Deputy Speaker dismissed calls for the zoning of the seat, saying that some past occupants of the seat spent as many as three terms. Alhaji Abdulrahman Boboi, who led a delegation to purchase form for Fintiri, said the people were satisfied with his performance since he mounted the saddle in 2019. According to him, the Governor has delivered in the areas of healthcare, education, infrastructure and youth empowerment. On his part, Ortom is taking a cue from many of his colleagues who got elected to the Senate after spending two terms of eight years as governors in their States.
