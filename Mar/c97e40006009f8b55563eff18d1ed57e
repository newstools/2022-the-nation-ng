He also ordered the clerk to write to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) notifying the elector body of the development and the need to conduct fresh elections in the affected constituencies. But the three lawmakers maintained they are still members of the House of Assembly. Speaking on their behalf in a telephone interview, Mr Victor Aleke, described the actions of the Speaker and APC lawmakers as illegal. According to him, the Speaker and the other APC lawmakers, having been sacked by the Federal High Court in Abuja, have ceased to be lawmakers and should not sit in the first place. “What they have done today by purporting to sit and declare our seats vacant amounts to contempt of court and the court may declare them wanted if care is not taken. “We have no reason whatsoever to resign our seats. We are still lawmakers representing our various constituencies and we enjoin our supporters and the general public to disregard what they have done,” Aleke said.
