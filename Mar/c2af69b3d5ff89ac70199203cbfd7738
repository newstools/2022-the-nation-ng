A certified dance and aerobics instructor, Victoria Akingbade, has urged women to engage in exercises and prioritise their health and continuously keep fit. She gave the charge at the weekend during the third edition of Lagos Women Dance at the National Stadium, Surulere Lagos to commemorate International Women’s Day. The event tagged: “Entertainment meets health” is an annual dance event for women in Lagos. Akingbade, who stressed the importance of dance, admonished women to avoid things detrimental to their health. “Dance is a high-energy activity which is beneficial to the health. Therefore, women should be actively involved in exercises, stay fit and relax when tired. They should also avoid sedentary lifestyles,” she said.

People lost their jobs. I realized women were going through so much stress, thus, it was important for them to dance, unwind and network,” she said. Mrs Blessing Kuje, a pregnant participant, said she attended the event to encourage other women to be involved in exercise. “I came here to encourage women despite being pregnant. I feel happy and delighted. Dance is good for the body, it helps to burn calories and makes one relaxed,” she said.
