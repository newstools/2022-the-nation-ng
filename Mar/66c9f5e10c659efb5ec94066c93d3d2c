President of NCF, Uyi Akpata said that the event would feature Rwanda, Ghana, Sierra Leone, The Gambia, Cameroon along with the host country Nigeria. “Our female national team has been one of the most improved of all our national teams in the last five years and our gender inclusion development agenda has thrown up massive talents that have left us with an ever-improving side. This event is apart from celebrating the milestones that the Federation has achieved in raising tons of female cricketers through its grassroots project – it is set to become a part of the process” The President added that creating opportunities for the national female team to constantly square up with tough African oppositions is a key objective in setting up the tournament and he also believes it will go a long way in raising the bar for aspiring players.   22 injured at Mexican football match     Firm to unveil football fund for investors     Joshua picks new head trainer for Usysk rematch   The Nigerian team has been camped in Benin City for over a week at the Edo Boys High School High-Performance Cricket center in Benin City under the watchful eyes of national coaches, trainers, and selectors.
