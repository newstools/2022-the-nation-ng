There has never been a time when beneficiaries were asked to produce any means of identification to show which caucus they belonged. “It is worthy to note that the Adeoriokin Movement has been canvassing members wanting to defect to stay with APC through our empowerment programmes and activities geared at fostering unity and peaceful coexistence. “My team comprises members, who, for reasons best known to them, might belong to any of the caucuses in the party, and none of them can say I ever selected members for special treatments or assignments based on their caucus; we are one big APC family. “The rumours should be disregarded and shunned by party faithful; it is the handiwork of idle minds and detractors. The activities of my detractors can never deter me, I would rather intensify my effort to make life worth living for the people of Ede/Egbedore/Ejigbo Federal Constituency.”
