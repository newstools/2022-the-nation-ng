Plateau United extended their unbeaten streak to 10 games after they managed to grab a priceless 1-1 draw against Enyimba in Aba yesterday in one of the NPFL Matchday 18 games. The Peace Boys who came into the tie at the back of eight wins and a draw were on the back foot in the 28th minute when Victor Mbaoma struck for Enyimba but Fidelis Ilechukwu’s men fought back gamely and equalised in the 71st minute Austin Opara who roared from the defence to score the leveller. It was how the game ended. With the draw Plateau United have now garnered 38 points from 18 games to remain in second place behind Rivers United who also have 38 points but have played a game lesser.
