Passersby have found a man and his mistress dead inside a Sienna car in the Mowe/Ibafo area of Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. The car bears a Lagos number plate, LSD 992 HH, and had a helmet on the dashboard. A resident of the area said, “The car was stationed along the road since Monday. But this morning, people moved closer and discovered that there were two bodies inside it. We don’t know what killed them.” Ogun State police spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed the incident yesterday, saying the couple did not die in the passion of romance. He said it was a case of murder first and suicide later.

What happened was that the girl in question happened to be a girlfriend to that man. He rented an apartment for her somewhere in Lagos. He went there to visit her. We don’t know what transpired between them, but we learnt he hit the woman on the head and she slumped,” Oyeyemi said. “He carried the lifeless body of the woman in his vehicle. People in that neighbourhood ran to Ilaje police station in Bariga to report. But he drove off straight to his house at Orimerunmu. He dropped a suicide note, informing his wife that he had killed somebody. He told his wife not to bother looking for him, asking her to take care of the children. Then he left the house. “He drove and parked near NASFAT area and committed suicide there. We saw a container of Sniper in the vehicle, which suggested that he drank Sniper (an insecticide). He wound up the glasses and died in the vehicle. “So, it is a case of murder and suicide.”
