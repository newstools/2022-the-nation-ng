The arraignment of the publisher of Sahara Reropers, an online news medium, Mr Omoyele Sowore, on cybercrime charges was stalled on Wednesday at the Federal High Court in Abuja following the absence of the lawyer to the second defendant in the matter. The Federal Government had filed the three-count criminal charges against Sowore following complaints by a businessman, Ned Nwoko. Sowore is the first defendant, while the news medium, Sahara Reporters, is the second defendant in the matter. Although Sowore was present in court to take his plea, Sahara Reporters had no representation.

He sought for a short adjournment to enable him perfect service of the charges on the organisation. Counsel to Sowore, Tope Temokin, did not object to the application for adjournment. Although Temokin initially announced an appearance for the second defendant, in a dramatic turn, he withdrew it. Justice Emeka Nwite granted adjournment request and fixed April 25 for the arraignment. Justice Nwite ordered the Federal Government to ensure service of the charges on the second defendant before the adjourned date.
