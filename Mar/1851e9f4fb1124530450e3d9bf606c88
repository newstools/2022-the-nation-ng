He noted that the bank’s strong balance sheet positions it to support customers across various markets and adequately execute its expansion strategy. He outlined that in order to actualise its vision of becoming the world’s most respected African bank and Africa’s payment gateway, the bank has taken strategic strides to create indelible footprints across the African continent. These footprints include most recent additions in South Africa, Botswana, and Guinea. It also strengthened its business in Mozambique and Zambia, with noticeable improvement in rankings and market share. He pointed out that in 2021, the bank successfully issued the first Additional Tier 1 (AT1) Eurobond out of Nigeria, a $500 million instrument that enhanced the bank’s capital ratios and provided significant headroom for growth and the execution of its strategic objectives. The bank also issued a $500 million Senior Unsecured Eurobond in 2021, elongating the duration of its foreign exchange balance sheet and strengthening its liquidity. “2022 is pivotal for our franchise, as we conclude our 2018-2022 corporate strategic plan. In the year, we will focus on a disciplined implementation of our strategy to drive efficiency and operational excellence across all segments, expand revenue and increase profitability, with enhanced focus on risk management practices and a disciplined cost containment structure. “As we go into our next five-year strategy cycle, we are realigning the franchise for growth, by transitioning into a holding company (HoldCo). This will enable us to unlock and capture available non-banking opportunities in the market, that would lead to the diversification of our earnings, drive efficiency, and grow scale while maintaining our moderate risk management approach. “Having met regulatory requirements and obtained the court sanction, we expect the HoldCo to become operational is the first half of 2022. This will lead to the delisting of Access Bank Plc’s shares on the Nigerian Exchange (NGX) and listing of Access HoldCo shares,” Wigwe said.
