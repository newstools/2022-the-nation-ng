Elegant midfielder Esther Onyenezide made it three on 25 minutes after converting from the penalty spot. However, just as they did at home in Senegal, the Young Lionesses of Teranga scored from the spot as well, putting away from six yards after one of their strikers was upended in the Nigerian box. In the second half, the Falconets sat comfortably on the game and allowed it to run their way, taking things easy and cutting off the few onslaughts of the visitors.
