Fuji singer, Saheed Osupa is currently locked in a cold war with the Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde. According to sources, the cold war between the singer and the governor is far from over even after the two were believed to have had a truce meeting. In a recent show that was held at the Liberty Stadium, Ibadan, the musician declared war on the Governor saying he will unearth some dirty secrets about him in his upcoming album.

Those in the know alleged that Osupa’s grudge against Makinde was what he termed ‘use and dump.’ Some months back, Osupa released an album where he told a story of Chief Rasheed Ladoja and Seyi Makinde mirroring it with betrayal and lies.
