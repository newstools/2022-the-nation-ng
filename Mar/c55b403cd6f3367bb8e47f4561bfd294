Senator Shehu Sani, who represented Kaduna Central in the Eight Assembly, has said Nigerians should be allowed to carry firearms to protect themselves. He said the government should allow Nigerians to bear the same weapons as terrorists to save lives and property in Kaduna. In a series of tweets on Wednesday, he said: “If the Government and security agencies can’t crush these terrorists and Bandits kidnapping and killing our people in Northern and Southern Kaduna, people should be officially allowed to carry same weapons, and let’s see who owns the land,” He charged the government to recruit locals between Abuja and Kaduna villages to protect the roads and rail tracks.
