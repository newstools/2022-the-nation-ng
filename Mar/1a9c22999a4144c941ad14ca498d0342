Speaking on the movie, the line producer, Kingsley Okoye Rex said: “I’m happy to be part of this amazing project that calls both the citizens and leaders to be accountable. It is a must-watch for every Nigerian.” Also, the director, versatile writer, and creative director Psalm Oderinde said “the experience was a dream come true. I have longed to express myself on political whatnots through film medium, but you know making a film as such requires accurate attention to detail for production design, costuming and casting right. All of these are solely executed with a fair budget. The organizers, that is Homevida provided adequate funding which aided the result of the production. Being the director of this film also exposed me to more professionals in the industry, some of whom I have only admired from afar but the production of Rebirth fostered a more cordial relationship, one which I do hope will open doors to greater opportunities for me in the industry”.
