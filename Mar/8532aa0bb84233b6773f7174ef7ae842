Singer 2Baba has argued former Head of State General Sani Abacha never actually looted money while bemoaning the level of corruption in the country. According to 2Baba, the money which Abacha was said to have stolen was being ‘kept’ away from the actual thieves. If not, he wondered how the looted funds were able to have been recovered. The 46-year-old singer maintained if Abacha really had the intention of stealing funds, it would have been impossible to recover it. Taking to his Insta story, 2Baba shared an image of late Abacha with the inscription: “If to say Abacha actually thief this money we for no fit recover am, abi na only me they think this thing.

Aluta continua abi.” Sani Abacha GCFR 20 September 1943 – 8 June 1998) was a Nigerian military general who served as the military Head of State of Nigeria from 1993 until his death in 1998. He was also Chief of Army Staff between 1985 to 1990; Chief of Defence Staff from 1990 to 1993; and Minister of Defence. In 1993, Abacha became the first Nigerian Army officer to attain the rank of a full military general without skipping a single rank. Abacha was said to have stolen billions of dollars and died before spending his loot, which prompted an international treasure hunt spread over decades.
