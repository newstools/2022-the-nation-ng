Kelechi Nwakali is set to return to training after the Association of Spanish Soccer Players got involved in his case against Spanish second division side SD Huesca. Nwakali was fined and barred from training after he returned ten days late following Nigeria’s elimination from the African Cup of Nations (AFCON). The former Arsenal youngster was reported to have missed Nigeria’s final game of the AFCON through illness and was too ill to return to Spain. The doctor that treated him advised him not to fly and to keep testing for covid-19 until his symptoms cleared. Kelechi notified Huesca about this.

No club was willing to pay the loan fee Huesca demanded, despite interest from second-tier clubs in both Spain and England. Kelechi has since returned to Spain and Huesca have opened up disciplinary proceedings against him, suspending him indefinitely and not allowing him to come to the training ground despite the fact he provided a doctor’s note explaining his lateness.
