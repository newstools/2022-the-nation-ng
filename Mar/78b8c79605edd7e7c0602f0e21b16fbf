Barcelona have reportedly made a move for Paris Saint-Germain attacker Kylian Mbappe. The 23-year-old’s contract in Paris is due to expire at the end of June, and he is widely expected to leave the French giants in search of pastures new. Real Madrid have long been regarded as the favourites for the France international, who has scored 26 times and registered 17 assists in 37 appearances at club level during the 2021-22 campaign.
