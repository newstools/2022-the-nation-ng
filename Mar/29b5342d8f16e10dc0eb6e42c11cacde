Nguyen noted that women and children had paid the highest cost of the 13-year-old conflict in the region. “In 2020, the lives of 170 children lost directly or indirectly each day due to reduced access to health care services. “We are laying the foundation for optimum well-being for thousands of children born and yet to be born. “With this intervention, expectant mothers in Yobe and Borno states will be able to access health facilities in their communities, and receive essential drugs, tests and basic medical support in primary health care facilities close to their homes,” he said.
