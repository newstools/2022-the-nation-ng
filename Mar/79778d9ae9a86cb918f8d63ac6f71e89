The controversy trailing last Saturday’s by-election in Imo State is far from being over. A group, the Coalition of South East Youth Leaders (COSEYL), has demanded the sack of the National Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) Chukwuemeka Ezeonu and the arrest and prosecution of Dennis Akoh, the INEC Returning Officer, for alleged complicity in the conduct of the election.

The body said: “It is very disheartening that the electoral umpire- INEC- that is supposed to be upright and impartial in its dealings, duties and obligation, took side with the highest bidder in the by-election.”
