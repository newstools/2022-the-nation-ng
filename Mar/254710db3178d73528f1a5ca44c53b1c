Watford midfielder Oghenekaro Etebo believes that the Super Eagles will triumph over Ghana’s Black Stars in the second leg of their World Cup playoff on Tuesday. Etebo featured for the last half hour in the first leg of the encounter, helping Nigeria keep a clean sheet in the 0-0 draw at the Baba Yara Stadium in Kumasi. With the Eagles pinned back by a victory-chasing Ghana, Etebo’s introduction for the injured Innocent Bonke was vital to the visitors gaining a degree of control in a midfield hitherto dominated by Arsenal’s Thomas Partey. Etebo will likely start in the return leg in Abuja scheduled for the Moshood Abiola Stadium in Abuja, as Nigeria target a win that guarantees a ticket to Qatar 2022.

In a similar vein, Super Eagles captain Ahmed Musa is convinced that the national team will achieve their aims with the unshaken support of fans. Musa (MON) wrote on Twitter, “The unity exhibited in the game yesterday is one that we seek for our game on Tuesday. Your massive turnout & support will be invaluable for the desired result. Hope to see you then. UP EAGLES!” The last time Nigeria hosted Ghana in a World Cup qualifier in 2001, goals from Victor Agali and Tijani Babangida (brace) gave the Eagles a 3-0 win at the Liberation Stadium in Port Harcourt.
