Taiwo Awoniyi scored an own goal as Union Berlin suffered a 1-0 loss to Wolfsburg in Saturday’s Bundesliga encounter. While trying to defend a corner-kick, Awoniyi flicked his header past goalkeeper Andreas Luthe to give Wolfsburg the lead in the 24th minute. Then Wolves hung on to the first-half lead to grab maximum points after settling for just a point in their last two league matches. Awoniyi, unfortunately, could not make up for his error and could not add to his tally of 10 Bundesliga goals so far this season.
