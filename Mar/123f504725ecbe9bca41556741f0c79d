The Vice-Chancellor, Bells University of Technology, Ota in Ogun, Prof. Jeremiah Ojediran, has called for quick resolution of the impasse between the Federal Government and the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU). Ojediran made the appeal in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday in Ota. He said the extension of the nationwide strike by ASUU by eight weeks would be detrimental to the nation’s education system. The vice-chancellor added that the strike would prolong the time students would spend in school. “It is unfair to the students to extend the strike by eight weeks, because this is not good for our educational system.

Ojediran said both ASUU and the federal government should resolve all issues, so as to end the continuous strike in the country’s university system. NAN reports that ASUU President, Prof. Emmanuel Osodeke, on Monday announced the extension of the 30 days warning strike by eight weeks. He said the extension was to ensure full implementation of the 2009 agreement between the union and the government. (NAN)
