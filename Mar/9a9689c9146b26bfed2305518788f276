Senate President Ahmad Lawan has said that President Muhammadu Buhari will continue to provide leadership to the All Progressives Congress (APC) beyond his exit from office in 2023. Lawan stated this in his remarks at the National Convention of the ruling party which held at Eagle Square, Abuja, on Saturday. According to him, Buhari’s ability to sustain unity within the party against all odds, positions him favourably as the “compass” needed to give direction to the party at all times. Lawan, according to a statement by his Special Assistant (Press) Ezrel Tabiowo, said, “Your Excellency, Mr. President, we can compare favourably well with any other party across the world. This is because you have provided the leadership that we need. “Let me be explicit; you will not be on the ballot in 2023, but you will remain the leading light and moral compass of APC even after your tenure finishes.

He added that the President’s commitment to the implementation and completion of projects would particularly see to the eventual commissioning of the second Niger Bridge in the Southeast zone later this year. He commended the Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee for stabilising the APC in the last 18 months of holding sway. Lawan described the National Convention as a strong statement by the APC attesting to its ability to provide leadership for the country and strengthen unity amongst members within its fold.
