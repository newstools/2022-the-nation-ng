Kogi State government has criticised a former Director-General of the Progressives Governors Forum, Salihu Lukman, for allegedly attacking Governor Yahaya Bello. Lukman had allegedly said Bello should not be allowed to get the presidential ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC). He also reportedly accused the governor of not paying the N30,000 minimum wage, while Kogi workers were earning 25 per cent of their salaries. Kogi Commissioner for Information and Communications, Kingsley Fanwo, in a statement yesterday, said Lukman’s allegations were baseless.   Sule: Only God will decide between Al-Makura, Adamu     Mustapha obtains nomination form for APC national chairman     Despite interests, APC still intact, says Sani Musa   He said Lukman should not “allow the frustration of his unceremonious and embarrassing exit as the Director-General of PGF take possession of his reasoning to the extent of disparaging party leaders.” He said Lukman unwittingly revealed that Bella was the candidate to beat in the APC primary. “Asking the party to prevent Yahaya Bello, a leading presidential hopeful, from getting the party’s ticket, already stamps the fact that all eyes are on him to take the party to victory in the 2023 General elections, which everyone knows will be keenly contested. “For the records, Lukman’s anti-party escapades while at the secretariat of the Progressive Governors’ Forum did not only cost him his job but also cast more ridicule on his already battered image,” the commissioner said. On the allegation of underpaying workers, Fanwo said: “Nigerians are adequately informed of the meagre allocations shared during the last FAAC meeting. Many states have yet to pay their February salary.”
