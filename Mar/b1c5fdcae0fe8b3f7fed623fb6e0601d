Bundle, a social trading app, has partnered the Feminst Coalition, and TEFEM, to donate educational and vocational grants to their communities. This initiative was part  of the International Women’s Day theme – #BreakTheBias. Bundle not only donated a grant but also sponsored women to take free courses on Art, Tech and Entertainment on Udemy. According to  its CEO, Emmanuel “Babz” Babolola, “Bundle’s decision to support this ecosystem of women is born out of the obvious gap between men and women in the crypto and tech space.

We intend to consciously drive inclusion by empowering these women with the knowledge and resources needed to take the next step. That’s why beyond the grant we will also be offering educational training on Udemy for those who are interested’. “The Feminist Coalition believes it is every girl’s right to access quality education. Women’s rights and safety is one of three pillars of our work and, undoubtedly, girls’ education is a space we are committed to working within, for the advancement of Nigerian women. This donation from Bundle to our Girls Education Programme will change the lives of brilliant young girls from disadvantaged communities,” said a Feminist Coalition spokesperson. The grant and training are all part of Bundle’s month-long campaign to celebrate women. Aside from the grant, Bundle will also be holding weekly Q&As on its telegram channel. Women who have made great strides in crypto spaces, will be speaking on  various aspects such as NFT, crypto trading. Also, women who have broken into major spaces in their career will be speaking on Bundle’s Twitter and Instagram, to charge other women to take the bold step they need to break the bias.
