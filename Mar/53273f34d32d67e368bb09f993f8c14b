An Osun High Court sitting in Osogbo, on Monday, refused the bail applications for the Chairman of Hilton Hotel, Ile-Ife, Rahmon Adedoyin and six others, charged with the murder of Timothy Adegoke. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Adegoke was a post-graduate student of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, who died in the hotel in November 2021. NAN also reports that the six other defendants, who were equally refused bail, were: Magdalene Chiefuna, Adeniyi Aderogba, Oluwole Florence, Oyetunde Kazeem, Adebayo Kunle and Adedeji Adesola. The Chief Judge of Osun, Justice Adepele Ojo, in her ruling, refused their bail applications due to the magnitude of the offence they allegedly committed.
