The Nigeria Football Federation ( NFF) has sacked the entire technical crew of the Super Eagles following the failure of the senior national team to qualify for the Qatar 2022 World Cup. The Super Eagles lost the ticket to Black Stars of Ghana in a 1-1 draw on Tuesday at the MKO National Stadium Abuja with the visitors going through on away-goal rule. The interim chief coach Augustine Eguavoen resigned earlier from the position to fall back to his role as Technical Director.   2023: Saraki, Tambuwal, Bala Mohammed meet IBB in Minna     Police defuse explosive in Rigasa train community     Soldier ‘abandoned’ during operation coward…   But a statement on Thursday by the NFF Secretary General Dr Mohammed Sanusi informed the glass house has wielded the big stick against the technical crew of the Super Eagles. It reads: “The NFF has in the meantime withdrawn the two-and-half years contract offered the coaches and terminated the appointment of the entire technical crew of the team with immediate effect. “A new crew will be announced after a proper review to lead the new charge of reinvigorating the Super Eagles to face future challenges appropriately. “We thank the coaches and team officials for their service to the nation and wish them success in their future endeavours.”
