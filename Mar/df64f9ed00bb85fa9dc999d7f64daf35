On the new single, Timaya teams up with Amapiano powerhouse Smeez and D3an for the creation and production of the song. Speaking on the newest body of work, the Port Harcourt-born artiste said the song will be a banger. “Anything I put my hand on must go well,” he boasted. “This track leaves you no choice but to move your body as you groove to this Amapianic essence.
