Real Madrid have announced that the team will don a black kit in El Clasico against Barcelona, which will take place at the Estadio Santiago Bernabeu tomorrow. The new kit, which has been released this season for Real Madrid’s 120th anniversary, was designed by legendary designer Yohji Yamamoto, who has been collaborating with Adidas for the last two decades. Having first collaborated on Real Madrid’s third kit for the 2014/15 season, this time the partnership expands for a broader collection that channels a symbolic coalescence of dynamism and speed.
