The Federal Government has assured the Muhammadu Buhari Bridge aka the Second Niger Bridge and the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway would be delivered in 2022. Minister of Works and Housing, Mr Babatunde Fashola, disclosed this while featuring on the weekly Ministerial Briefing, organised by the Presidential Communication Team at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. Fashola explained that the initial February completion date projection for the Second Niger Bridge failed due to the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown and EndSARS protests, adding the project was already at 91% completion stage. The briefing was to enable him provide further updates on key collaborations between the Federal Government and the State Governments in the implementation of some of the major reforms being executed by the Ministry and the Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund (PIDF).
