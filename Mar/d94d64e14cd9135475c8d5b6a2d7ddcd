NIGERIA midfielder Wilfred Ndidi has predicted tough encounters in this month’s World Cup playoff against Ghana. He said of the World Cup qualifier knockouts: “It will mean a lot for us to go back to the World Cup. “But Ghana will not be easy. To be honest, we have to be careful about their whole team and not just any specific players. It will be two tough games.” Ndidi is a key part of the Nigeria team, and although the Super Eagles suffered a poor Africa Cup of Nations earlier this year, he’s looking forward to making it to another World Cup.   ‘We have taken steps to reposition Lobi Stars’     Nigeria v Ghana: Ighalo’s inclusion raises doubt     Troost-Ekong ruled out of clash against Ghana   He said: “I just want to keep working hard and enjoying my game every moment. I am working on improving myself every day to become a better player.” Speaking about his 200th appearances for Leicester, Ndidi said he’s elated to reach the landmark. “I was not thinking about all that before the game [against Randers], “but it means a lot to me to be able to make 200 appearances for Leicester and also to score because I am seeing myself growing and I am very proud of that.” He added: “When I joined, I didn’t think of anything [like this]. I just wanted to play football, but with prayer, hard work, and believing in myself, I think that is what has helped me. “And it also helps when you have a great manager that understands you, teammates that you enjoy being around, the culture of the club and the fans. It all makes it easier to focus and just play.”
