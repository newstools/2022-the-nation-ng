Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo on Monday announced the re-opening of land and sea borders and the lifting of most of the COVID-19 restrictions. In his 28th nationwide COVID-19 address, the president said the decision was made after reviewing the raft of measures put in place to help win the fight against the virus, against the background of rapidly declining infections, and the relative success of the vaccination campaign by the Ghana Health Service. “From Monday, the wearing of face masks is no longer mandatory. “I encourage all of you to continue to maintain enhanced hand hygiene practices and avoid overcrowded gatherings.

I appeal to all of us to live responsibly, protect ourselves, and do everything we can to stay safe as we lift these restrictions,” Akufo-Addo said. (Xinhua/NAN)
