Stakeholders in the gender violence space have urged journalists to be conscious of the humanity, dignity and mental health of the survivors of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) while reporting such issues. They urged the media to ensure that they are careful not to denigrate the dignity of the survivors. While addressing journalists in Abuja during a workshop organised by the BAOBAB for Women’s Human Rights, the Country Director of Amnesty International Nigeria Osai Ojigho, urged media practitioners to ensure that they do not contribute to secondary trauma, assault and unnecessary exposure of the survivors of SGBV. While noting that religion, culture, and the inability of lawmakers to fully comprehend sexual and gender violence issues were some of the reasons the National Assembly turned down the Gender and Equal Opportunities Bill, she urged the lawmakers to recognise and respect women’s rights.

We must ensure that gender equality is something that is recognised, not just in our laws but also in our constitution,” she said. The Executive Director of BAOBAB for Women’s Human Rights, Mrs Bunmi Dipo-Salami said: “We want to break the bias in the media representation of women in reporting sexual violence and re-victimisation of survivors of Sexual and Gender-based Violence (SGBV) by the media.” The Director of the MacArthur Foundation Africa Office in Abuja, Dr Kole Shettima, added: “We should not perpetuate our own biases as facts while reporting issues. “As we talk of SGBV, we  must be conscious of reporting about poor women whose voices are not usually heard, and who face these issues more. We must give voice and justice to the voiceless and victims of injustice.”
