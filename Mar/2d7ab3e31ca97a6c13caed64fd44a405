I’m happy to lend my voice to this important issue and moment,” she said. According to the foundation, Yemi has been vocal about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines, the importance of vaccine equality, and the need to dispel myths around COVID-19 and vaccines—particularly in Africa. “COVID-19 vaccine acceptance is important to achieving herd immunity and safeguarding citizens in Africa and globally against the virus and its variants. That’s why Africa CDC and the Mastercard Foundation are joining efforts in ensuring access to vaccines for Africa,” said Dr. John Nkenagsong, Director, Africa CDC. Speaking on the appointment, the President/CEO of the Mastercard Foundation, Reeta Roy said misinformation spreads fast, so the organisation needs to be more creative to spread the right information faster.
