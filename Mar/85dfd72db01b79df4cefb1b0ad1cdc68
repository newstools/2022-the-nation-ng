The Deji of Akure, Oba Aladetoyinbo Ogunlade, has lost his bid to appoint a traditional ruler in Isikan community, Akure South local government. Oba Aladetoyinbo last year filed an originating summons attempting to stop the Government of Ondo State from recognising the Iralepo of Isikan stool as a Chieftaincy in the State. The Akure monarch argued that a judgement of the Court of Appeal had declared the Iralepo of Isinkan was a quarter Chief under the Prescribed Authority of the Deji of Akure. But Chief Sola Ebiseni, Counsel to the newly appointed Iralepo of Isikan, Oba Olugbenga Ojo, in a preliminary Objection, said the Deji of Akure has no locus standi to institute the action being not a member of Isinkan or of its Ruling House. Ebiseni said Oba Aladetoyinbo failed to fulfill the conditions precedent to instituting the action under the Chieftaincy Laws.

In his ruling, Justice Olusegun Odusola dismissed the Preliminary Objection holding that the Claimant’s originating processes disclosed sufficient interest to institute the action which he said disclosed a reasonable cause of action. Justice Odusola upheld the views of the Defendants’ counsel that the appointment of the Iralepo of Isinkan as a recognized Chieftaincy subsists as the Instrument of appointment legally made by the Executive Council had not been challenged or set aside. He dismissed the suit of the Deji and the Akure community saying it lacked merit.
