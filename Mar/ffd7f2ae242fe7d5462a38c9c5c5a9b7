An Igbo group, Nkata Ndi Inyom Igbo has expressed displeasure over non-assent to gender equality bills by the National Assembly and a constitutional review that can engender equity. According to the group, “only women understand the pain of poverty and create the economic environment for prosperity. Women need to operate on a level playing field through the enabling laws by the National Assembly but some members are making this impossible.” The group disclosed that Nigeria has the highest number of out-of-school children in the world at more than 13 million, saying most of the illiterate population are women and an uneducated woman often has many challenges raising children who can be maximally productive for national development.

The women need to have equal political platforms to right these wrongs,” the group said. “We at Nkata Ndi Inyom Igbo insist that the Nigerian National Assembly must as a matter of urgency pass all gender equality bills to empower more women to participate actively in nation-building. “We acknowledge the efforts of some members of the National Assembly towards the passage of the bills but we are disappointed at those who vehemently oppose equity and justice for all citizens. We are taking note of all of them,” the group said.
