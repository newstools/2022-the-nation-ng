Singer Mayorkun has described the death of some Nigerians in the Kaduna train attack as “very unreasonable and undeserving”. Blaming the government for the mishap in an Insta story post, the 28-year-old singer also called on them to wake up to its duties to the citizens. “My heart goes out to everyone affected by the Kaduna train attack! It’s very unreasonable and undeserving to say the least”, he wrote. “Reading the sad story about Chinelo even makes me feel worse, she and everyone on that train didn’t deserve this.

Mayorkun insisted it was the government’s sole responsibility to provide an environment that is safe for its citizens and their properties. “It’s high time we held our leaders accountable for our lives and properties. It’s what they promised us and it’s what we voted them to do. “Today it’s Kaduna and if nothing continues to be done. Tomorrow it could be anywhere else,” he said.
