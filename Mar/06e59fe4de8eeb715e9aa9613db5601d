I don’t pass judgment or give direction but there are a lot of drug users that don’t joke about eating and when you see them you won’t believe they are drug users. “But when you lose your mind and you don’t take care of yourself, you look emaciated. I rest, work, and don’t do anything in excess.” Continuing, K1 chipped in about his love life saying he gets pampered by his woman, Emmanuella Ropo. “I also love as every responsible man should. When I am in the arms of my woman, she certainly pampers me,” he said.
