Controversial singer Portable has appealed to critics to quit comparing his idols, Wizkid and Davido. Following Davido’s performance at the London O2 arena on Saturday, March 5, 2022, his fans and Wizkid have continued to compare and contrast their performances. Wizkid’s fans have claimed it took Davido months to sell out his show’s tickets unlike the former who sold out his in a few hours.   So many things don’t come naturally to me – Simi     Fame can be intoxicating, says Mildred Okwo     Age not just a number, says Pete Edochie at 75   There has also been an argument that the arena was not fully occupied for Davido’s concert-like Wizkid’s. A whole lot of other criticisms and counter criticisms have continued to brew among the fans of the duo. The Zazu crooner via his Twitter handle urged critics of the singers to make peace with the fact that they are both great artistes and need not be compared. “No dey compare Wizkid and Davido. Both of them sabi this thing, find peace”, Portable tweeted.
