Popular disc jockey and actress, DJ Dorcas Shola Fapson has explained why she opened Davido’s O2 arena concert on Saturday with Wizkid’s song. Before the show kicked off in full gear, the international disc jockey set the crowd reeling with grammy-winning singer’s “No Lele”, an act that has earned her backlash, especially from Davido’s fans. Speaking in a video, Fapson revealed the act was intentional adding, it’s something she would also replicate in at Wizkid’s concert. She explained the crowd needed a burst of energy different from what they were about to experience, in order to gear them up for the show. The 31-year-old entertainer said: “If I was opening Wizzy’s show, the first song I will play is “Dami Duro” because I need a ‘ginger’ crowd. That’s what gingers the crowd.   Don’t compare Wizkid, Davido, Portable tells critics     So many things don’t come naturally to me – Simi     Fame can be intoxicating, says Mildred Okwo   “I can’t open Davido’s show with David’s songs because he’s about to come out and perform those songs. So, it’s going to lose the ginger. The talented media personality further berated critics (both fans of the singers) to stop being ‘killjoy’ and learn to love them equally. “Use your medulla oblongata when you’re commenting on my post. Don’t disturb my happiness because I’m happy but you guys have started irritating me. Use sense when commenting”, she said. “And let me tell you guys something, it’s okay to be 30BG and Starboy FC, it’s okay. The video’s caption reads: “It’s ok to be 30BG and Starboy FC. YOU WILL NOT DIE! I promise you! Support everyone, spread love.”
