In continuation of its vision and strategy to ensure promptness, effectiveness and efficiency in the handling of emergency call services through the Emergency Communication Centres (ECC), the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has embarked on the deployment of Computer-Aided Dispatch (CAD) solution. This bolstering of the capacity of emergency response agencies is coming on the heels of Commission’s activation of the Taraba State ECC, thus bringing the number of ECCs across to 25.

These ECCs are located in the FCT, Adamawa, Imo, Enugu, Ondo, Oyo, Kwara, Plateau, Ogun, Kano, Katsina, Ekiti, Cross River and Edo. Others are Kaduna, Akwa Ibom, Anambra, Benue, Kogi, Bauchi, Osun, Zamfara, Kebbi and Gombe states. To modernise the centres, the NCC initiated the deployment of CAD for the response agencies. The Commission has deployed the CAD system in the commands of six response agencies, including the Nigerian Police Force (NPF), Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), states’ Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), as well as in Ambulance and Fire Services in seven states. The states that have benefited from the deployment are Ogun, Cross River, Enugu, Kwara, Kano, Adamawa and FCT.
