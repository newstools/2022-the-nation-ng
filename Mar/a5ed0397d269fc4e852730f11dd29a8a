The National Association of Master Bakers, Caterers of Nigeria has threatened to shut production following increases in the price of diesel in the past few days. At a press conference in Owerri, the state capital yesterday, the state Chairman of the association, Chief Osmond Nkeoma, said if anything was not done to control the increase in the cost of bread, the product would no longer be affordable to the common man.   Blast at Nembe field cut oil export by 25,000 bpd, says Eni     ‘Households yet to recover from COVID-19…     CBN’s loan scheme for NPower beneficiaries makes debut   He noted that costs of diesel, vegetable oil and sugar had gone beyond the reach of the bakers. “We are particularly worried about the astronomical increases in the cost of diesel, vegetable oil and sugar, which are essential in the production of bread. “Diesel is sold for N600 and above per litre, sugar has been left to only Dangote to produce, we don’t see other companies like BUA, now a bag of sugar we used to buy for N20,500 now sells for N25,000,vegetable oil we buy N26,000 now sells for N35,000,” Nkeoma lamented. He, however, appealed to the Federal Government to intervene to prevent the association from carrying out its threat.
