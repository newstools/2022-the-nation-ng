Music superstars Beyoncé and Billie Eilish will perform their Oscar-nominated songs live at 94th Academy Awards ceremony on March 27. Beyoncé will sing “Be alive,” a song she co-wrote for the movie “King Richard” about the father of tennis legends Venus and Serena Williams, at the film industry honours on Sunday. Over the years, the Academy has shown its affection for Beyoncé as a performer. In 2005, the singer performed numerous tracks in the best song category on the live broadcast, including “Learn to Be Lonely” from the feature remake of “The Phantom of the Opera”. She sang with Jennifer Hudson and Anika Noni Rose in 2007 with a medley from “Dreamgirls” and in 2009 to accompany host Hugh Jackman in a montage celebrating movie musicals.
