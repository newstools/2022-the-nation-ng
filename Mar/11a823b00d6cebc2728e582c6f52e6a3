The fourth set was match power-for-power and shot-for-shot with the Chinese showing some nervousness when Aruna was ahead at 7-6. But the experience of the Olympic champion came to the fore as he fended off the strong challenge from the Nigerian to walk away with 11-9 win for an overall 3-1 victory and advance to Round of 16 of the Men’s Singles. “I didn’t get intimidated, I was just playing my own game and trying to be myself as much as possible but in the end, he was much better than me. I hope I can do better next time as I fly back home tomorrow with the hope of doing well at the next tournament in Doha,” Aruna said afterwards.
