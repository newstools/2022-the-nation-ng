The Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) on Friday described the face-off between Iyom Bianca Ojukwu and Eberechukwu Obiano as a very unfortunate and disgraceful incident. On Thursday during the inauguration of Prof.Charles Soludo as Anambra Governor Willie Obiano’s wife, Ebelechukwu and Bianca Ojukwu engaged in fisticuffs. Obiano’s wife had confronted Bianca, accusing her of not wanting the husband to be Governor while calling her a bitch. In retaliation, Mrs Ojukwu stood up and slapped her leading to a fight.

He said the open confrontation was a disgrace to womanhood as the two women were worshipped and praised in the region. “These two magnified, exalted and praise worshipped women are wrong. They couldn’t exercise restraint because of deep hatred and the cold war between them. “They suddenly forgot what they represent in Anambra State and Igbo land in general. “Everyday is for the thief but one day is for the owner. When a sane person in nakedness pursues a mad person that collected his clothes in the street, the public view simply means that the two persons are mad people.”
