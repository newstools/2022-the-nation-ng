Delta Governor Ifeanyi Okowa has dismissed insinuations of endorsing any governorship aspirant on the platform of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) for the Delta 2023 governorship election. Commissioner for Information, Charles Aniagwu, said the aspirants may have misconstrued the Governor when they consulted him about their governorship ambition. Three governorship aspirants, including Deputy Governor Kingsley Otuaro; Speaker Sheriff Oborevwori and former Minister of State for Education, Kenneth Gbagi have claimed that Okowa has endorsed them. But Delta Information Commissioner, Charles Aniagwu, accused the aspirants of dropping, stressing the aspirants were simply identifying with the achievements of his administration and the integrity which he had built over the years. Aniagwu said the Governor as a democrat would not be interested in asking anybody to step down. According to him: “The Governor will not be interested in asking anybody to step down because he is a democrat. But his achievements and pedigree will speak very loud.

The governor’s pedigree is quite high and everybody wants to have that covering,” he said. “If you go and meet him to say you want to run, you are being courteous. Naturally, he will not ask you to stop because it is assumed that you have accessed and you have the capacity to run. “And if you believe that because he did not ask you to stop, that it is an endorsement, there is nothing wrong with it. “What is important is that we hope and believe that all our members who are interested in positions whether the governorship or legislature, that they are able to play safely and with respect for one another. “So the Governor hopes that anybody who is contesting will use the most sane words; have respect for one another; recognize the fact that we are one family; recognize the need for us to sustain the development trajectory in the State. “Not too many people are carrying money and jumping up and down because they believe that the best just have to come, knowing that the enormity of succeeding Okowa is a task that would require a whole lot of strength if the person must indeed command the respect that this administration enjoys at the moment.”
