United Action for Change (UAC) has condemned the attack on its member, Mr Lanre Suraju, a frontline civil rights and anti- corruption crusader. Suraju’s residence was invaded on Monday by heavily armed goons, who traumatised him and his family and carted away some of his property. A statement by the group’s Secretary, Michael Popoola Ajayi, said: “The well-armed goons numbering about five used sophisticated equipment to violently gain access to Suraju’s house at about 2:17 am and subjected him and his family to the worst form of physical assault and also went away with assets which include but not limited to: vital documents, 1 Samsung phone, 2 iPhones, 2 iPads; 2 Macbook pro laptops, a Dell laptop, a Toyota Corolla 2014 car, jewelries, ATM cards, cars keys, Bank Tokens.   Senator Abiru greets lawmaker at 50     Oniru’s mum dies at 85     We’re desperate to fix Nigeria, says party   “We condemn this heinous invasion which is viewed by us as part of the orchestrated efforts by very powerful persons in the country on whom his anti-corruption crusade has impacted negatively to silence him.” The group urged Lagos State Commissioner of Police Abiodun Alabi to unravel the perpetrators and bring them to justice. “We call on the federal government and its relevant agencies to put in place mechanisms to protect whistle-blowers if its much-mouthed fight against corruption is to be taken seriously as actions of criminal elements like this that deliberately singled out Mr Suraju for attack in his community may discourage other patriotic Nigerians from speaking out against official corruption in our polity,” Ajayi said.
