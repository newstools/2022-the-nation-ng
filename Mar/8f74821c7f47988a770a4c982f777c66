German coach Gernot Rohr believes an inquest into the Super Eagles’ failure to pick a ticket to the Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup would be a welcome development. Rohr had a relatively successful period with the Super Eagles as the national team qualified for Russia 2018 FIFA World Cup as well two consecutive Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in 2019 Egypt and 2021 Cameroon. Yet the former Bayern Munich defender was unceremoniously sacked on the eve of Cameroon 2021 even after securing the Qatar 2022 play-off spot for the Super Eagles and replaced with coach Austin Eguavoen; under whose watch the Super Eagles suffered a humiliating Round of 16 AFCON exit  to Tunisia  which  was  followed by  Qatar 2022 knockout on Tuesday after that  listless 1-1 draw to Ghana.

We (Nigeria) have the better players, but it was not enough!” Knocked for sticking to his guns during his time, Rohr said it was about time those who took decisions regarding Super Eagles should be queried for what went wrong. “I saw somewhere that the World Cup (Qatar 2022) is not negotiable but what says the man now?” noted Rohr in apt reference to NFF President Amaju Pinnick‘s infamous tweet last month  that: ‘make no mistake. World Cup qualification is non-negotiable.“ But those responsible should speak now.”
