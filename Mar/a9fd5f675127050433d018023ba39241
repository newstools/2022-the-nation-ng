Rectors of Federal Polytechnics have demanded for the creation of the Ministry of Technical and Vocational Education to drive skills training for the development of entrepreneurship and TVET sector for sustainable national development. The Rectors made the call at the end of a workshop for Chairmen and Principal Officers of Federal Polytechnics organised by the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE) in collaboration with the Committee of Federal Polytechnic Rectors. The rectors, who lamented the effect of embargo on recruitment of quality staff to man TVET institutions, called on the Office of the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation to consider the issuance of waiver for replacement of staff to salvage the system from imminent collapse. In a communique signed by its Chairman, Dr. Baba David Danjuma and Secretary, Lawal Hafiz, the Rectors noted the inadequacy in the funding of polytechnic education in Nigeria.

The rectors appealed for the immediate release of the N15 billion approved by President Muhammadu Buhari as part of the revitalisation fund for public polytechnics. They also noted with concern, the conversion of Polytechnics to Universities which they said was exacerbating the existing skill gaps in the nation. The rectors therefore called on the Federal and State Governments to halt the trend.
