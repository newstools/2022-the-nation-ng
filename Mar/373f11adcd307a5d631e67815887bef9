Thank God I am not a promoter that owes money. “All the shows I’ve gotten for you, you get your complete money and I do not even get any percentage from you. I want something to get to your brains, it seems you get affected by the things you smoke and you need to get to rehab so that you will become fine. I am not your manager, I am your promoter. “You cannot tell me not to promote. I’m okay. I’m comfortable, I’m rich enough, I’m fine and you know it. It is now you who owes me money. “All your demands for signature are not needed as I am longer working with you. Keep you work and anything you think you have. “Currently, you are the one who owes me money, you borrowed money from me, so now I will send my account number to you, drop my money. Also DMW from Davido gave you some money to feature on his show and you ignored it, you have spent the money so please return the money and let me also give him back his money. “You are not the first artist to attain fame and you won’t be the last artist to attain fame as well. We have led many artists to fame and we will lead many more artists.”
