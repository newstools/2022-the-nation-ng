This is a far cry from when it started in 2010 and graduating 285 technicians. The Director-General, ITF, Joseph Ari, disclosed this during a World Press Conference on ITF- NECA, and signing of Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with participating organisations  in Abuja, stating that the trained technicians are either employed in corporate organisations or have become entrepreneurs employing people.
