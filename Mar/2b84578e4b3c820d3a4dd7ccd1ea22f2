Sadio Mane’s first-half goal was enough to give Liverpool victory over West Ham at Anfield and move them back within three points of Premier League leaders Manchester City. Jurgen Klopp’s men deserved the win but it did not come without the odd scare as Pablo Fornals and Manuel Lanzini both wasted excellent chances to equalise. The Hammers’ frustrations were compounded by the loss of in-form Jarrod Bowen to what looked like a significant injury, the forward helped off the pitch and down the tunnel following a collision with former Hull team-mate Andy Robertson. Liverpool had chances to extend their lead, with new signing Luis Diaz particularly impressive.

And now Liverpool fans are in the unusual position of hoping for a United victory in Sunday’s Manchester derby at Etihad Stadium. At times, Liverpool’s attack is so fast and fluid it is impossible for opposition defences to cope. And in Luis Diaz, their £37.5m January arrival from Porto, they have a player that fits that template perfectly. The Colombian produced a wonderous piece of skill to create an early chance for himself which he drove into Craig Dawson’s face. Diaz then came close twice in the second half too, with the first of those particularly impressive in the way he manipulated Mane’s pass into a scoring chance that went narrowly wide. When he was replaced in the final minute of injury time, his standing ovation was fully deserved.
