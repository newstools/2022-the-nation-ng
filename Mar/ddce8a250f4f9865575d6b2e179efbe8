Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti has emerged as a new managerial option for Manchester United on the recommendation of Sir Alex Ferguson. Paris Saint-Germain manager Mauricio Pochettino is thought to be the leading target to become the new permanent boss at Old Trafford with Erik ten Hag of Ajax also being strongly considered. Ferguson, who left his post as manager in 2013 but still serves as a non-executive director, is an admirer of Pochettino. But should the Argentine not be available, Ferguson has recommended the club consider bringing in Ancelotti on a short-term basis, according to ESPN.

The Italian, who has had two spells in the Premier League with Chelsea and Everton, is viewed as an option who could prove successful on a short-term basis having also spent much of his career managing high profile players. Ancelotti has won the Champions League three times as a manager during his decorated career, including with current United stars Cristiano Ronaldo and Raphael Varane in 2014. While Ajax boss ten Hag is also on United’s shortlist, the Dutchman has reservations over the set-up behind the scenes at Old Trafford, according to the report. Luis Enrique is another option being considered – but the Spaniard is set to remain in charge of Spain until after the World Cup in Qatar in December.
