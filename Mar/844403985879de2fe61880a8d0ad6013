Eko Electricity Distribution Company (EKEDC) has expressed concern over the power supplied to it by the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN). In a statement, the company’s spokesperson, Godwin Idemudia, noted that TCN’s  power supply  to EKEDC’s network has dropped from 450MW to 156MW, thereby leading to low power supply to its numerous customers.   Nigerian Content retains $8b yearly, creates 50,000 jobs     Domestic gas demand, requirement now 4.482b scuf daily, says…     Fed Govt urged on full implementation of gas policy   The expected supply allocation to the Alagbon transmission substation is 100MW, but the DisCo gets 67MW while Ijora transmission substation expects an average of 75MW but receives 13MW. This, Idemudia said, is nowhere near enough to satisfy its customers. He apologised to customers for the inconveniences the shortfall is causing them. Last week, Eko Disco signed an agreement with the Niger Delta Power Holding Company Limited to improve the quality of supply in the company’s franchise area and to meet the high demand of its growing network.
