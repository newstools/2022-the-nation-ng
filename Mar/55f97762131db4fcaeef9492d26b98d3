Lagos State government has begun the publication of details of sex offenders in the state. This is in furtherance of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s zero tolerance to all forms of domestic and sexual violence. Executive Secretary of the Lagos State Domestic and Sexual Violence Agency (DSVA), Mrs Titilola Vivour-Adeniyi said this yesterday at a press conference. To be published are names and pictures of the sex offenders, nature of the offence as well as the duration of the sentence handed down by the court.

She also said letters of advisory have been issued to local governments and traditional rulers of the communities where the convicts previously resided. She said the measure is one among many deployed by the state government to end impunity and also serve as a deterrence to other sex offenders. The details of sex convicts are to be published periodically on www. lagosstate.gov.ng, the website of the Ministry of Justice (https://lagosstatemoj.org) and the Agency’s website www.dsvrtlagos.org) To report sexual violence, Lagosians are to call toll-free number 08000333333.
