Liverpool’s seven-match winning run in the Champions League was ended by Inter Milan, but Jurgen Klopp’s side progressed to the quarter-finals with a 2-1 aggregate success. An outstanding finish by Lautaro Martinez was not enough for Italian champions at Anfield as the late goals by Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah in the first leg in Milan three weeks ago proved decisive. Martinez gave Alisson no chance with an arrowed finish from 20 yards in the 61st minute. But Inter’s hopes of forcing extra-time with a second goal faded when former Arsenal and Manchester United forward Alexis Sanchez was sent off just two minutes later for a second yellow card.
