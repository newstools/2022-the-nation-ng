Gov. Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State says he is hopeful of the possibility of a woman emerging as the Executive Governor of the state considering their numerical strength. Fielding questions from journalists in Kaduna on Tuesday, he said there was ‘50 per cent’ chance of a woman emerging as the next governor because women accounted for half the population of the state. The governor, whose deputy is a female, Dr Hadiza Balarabe, said the state government would continue to give equal opportunity to women, noting that it had key women commissioners. “You cannot ignore half of your population; it’s like clapping with one hand; 50 per cent of our women and young people make up the state. “We always feel that giving women the same opportunities will make them perform well, even better than men.
