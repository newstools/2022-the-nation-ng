Manager Brendan Rodgers was delighted with the resilience and courage of Leicester City’s performance in the 1-0 victory over Leeds United, while he singled out Kelechi Iheanacho for praise. The Foxes made it back-to-back wins in the Premier League – and three in all competitions – with Harvey Barnes’ second-half strike ultimately enough to secure all three points in Jesse Marsch’s first game in charge of Leeds. It’s a result that elevates City to 10th  in the table with games in hand. “It was a really tough game for us today,” the Northern Irishman told LCFC TV. “We know Leeds’ physicality and how they run and how they work, but I thought the players showed a great amount of courage. Again, we had to adjust the players, [with some] playing out of position.”   22 injured at Mexican football match     Firm to unveil football fund for investors     Joshua picks new head trainer for Usysk rematch   Adapting to a new tactical idea at Leeds, following Marsch’s appointment, was a challenge for Leicester, but Rodgers was pleased with how the Foxes counteracted a new array of threats. “We knew the principles of the game would be pretty much the same,” he added. “They would want to press, they would want to run and play forward. “Kels (Kelechi Iheanacho) does really well because he offers himself for the bounce-pass and then Harvey does what he does great. He’s really becoming a good finisher and he finished it really well.”
