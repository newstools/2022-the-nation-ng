Prof. Ayade lamented that forest-bearing communities had been dislocated and their land mass eroded, thus creating huge environmental challenges with a cumulative long term consequence.

The governor said: “Cross River State has 58 per cent of the entire forest cover of Nigeria. We have concerns about the rate and the speed of depletion of our forests. “It is against this backdrop that I am sending a note of final warning that I cannot watch the complete degeneration of our forest, as we see illegal logging becoming the order of the day.”
