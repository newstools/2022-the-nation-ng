Celebrities led by Korede Bello, Mr Macaroni and reality star, Wathoni have reacted to the murder of Oluwabamise Ayanwole. Korede Bello, a singer and ambassador of the Nigerian Police Force, tweeted. “I will never understand how people can look so normal and yet be so evil! Are we ever really safe? “I pray Bamise’s family gets justice for their daughter. This is overwhelming heartbreaking.” Mr Macaroni tweeted: “Bamise’s story is so heartbreaking. It is even more worrisome that we don’t know how many people have suffered the same fate as her. “For all we know there could be more to suffer the same fate and that is because it is hard to get justice in our society,” the actor, skit maker and activist said. Wathoni prayed that those responsible for her death be apprehended.
