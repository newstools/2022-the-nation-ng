Bayelsa State Governor Douye Diri has made a surprise visit to the camp of the state-owned female football team, Bayelsa Queens, to motivate the players. The governor, not impressed with the state of facilities, directed the immediate relocation of the players from the camp to a more suitable place pending the provision of a permanent camp. Diri said the state government would take steps to provide a befitting permanent site for both Bayelsa United and Bayelsa Queens.
