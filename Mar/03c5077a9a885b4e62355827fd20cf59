The derailment of a Lagos-Kano passenger train on Saturday was caused by track vandalism, the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC), said yesterday. Deputy Director, Public Relations, Yakub Mahmood, who disclosed this in a statement, said the Derailment, which occurred at Bode Sadu-Jebba Section, was without any casualty because it involved two baggage vans.

Mahmood said the train arrived at Kano safely, while the corporation’s team of engineers was already on the site to ensure the restoration of the affected portion of the track. Last Monday, Managing Director, NRC, Fidet Okhiria, at a press briefing at the NRC headquarters Lagos, lamented the alarming rate at which critical infrastructure of the Corporation, especially the tracks on both the narrow and standard gauge, was being vandalised, thwarting the rehabilitation and modernisation efforts of the Federal Government on the of the entire railway system. Okhiria enjoined the media to sensitise the general public on the dangers of track vandalism.
