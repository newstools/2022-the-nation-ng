K1 urged Fuji artists to keep promoting the traditional genre of music positively. “I think this is the best time for all fuji musicians, wherever they might be, to draw from their inner strength, wake up from their slumber, and boost the image of this genre of music. “You may not like me but you cannot change the will of God over my life. So, you should join hands with me to duly recognise and celebrate the pathfinder of fuji music (Barrister), who created opportunities for many people,” he said.
