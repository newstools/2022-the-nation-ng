Rapper Erigga has sparked mixed reactions with a tweet that revealed his desire to be a cow. Seemingly ‘heavy laden’ with life’s demands, the controversial artiste took to his Twitter page to wish he were an animal, a cow precisely. According to Erigga, if he lived as a cow, he won’t have any kind of responsibility as he would only just be grazing in the field without stress. “I wish I was a cow. Just eating grass in a field . No rent , no sub, no job , no stress , just moo”, he wrote. Erigga’s post has got many expressing varying opinions and more surprising is the fact that some persons share similar wish with him. abayomi_alvin said: “Just Moo…and become Party Beef at some point in life.
