The Federal Government’s extension granted to telecom subscribers across the country to link their subscriber identity module (SIM) with their National Identity Numbers (NINs) ends today. The March 31,  extension was granted last December after the earlier deadline had elapsed. It is uncertain if the Federal Government will grant any  extension as calls made to the spokesman of the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC), Kayode Adegoke, and the Director of Public Affairs at the Nigerian Communications Commission (NIMC), Dr. Ikechukwu Adinde, were not returned last night. Also, there was no response to a text message sent to Adegoke’s phone number seeking clarification on the matter. Last year, the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Prof. Isa Pantami, had conveyed the approval of the Federal Government to  extend the deadline for the NIN-SIM data verification till March 31, 2022.

NIMC also set up enrolment centres in over 31 countries to cater for Nigerians in the Diaspora. The growth in the National Identity Database to over 71 million unique NINs in such a short period, with about three to four SIMs linked to a NIN, reflects the concerted effort of the Federal Government, the Nigerian populace and legal residents. The minister, the Executive Vice Chairman/CEO of NCC, Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta, and the Director General/CEO of NIMC, Aliyu Aziz, on behalf of the Federal Government, thanked all Nigerians and stakeholders for their commitment and support towards the success of the project.
