The United Kingdom Embassy in Nigeria has announced the temporary suspension of study, work and family visa applications. It explained this was because the priority has been placed on applications made under the Ukraine Family Scheme. In a statement posted on the official Twitter page of the United Kingdom Embassy in Nigeria on Tuesday, the embassy announced that Ukraine Family Scheme was launched in response to the humanitarian crisis arising from the invasion of Ukraine. The statement titled: ‘Temporary suspension of priority visas for student, work and family applications’, clarified that Nigerians, whose passports were ready for collection, would be contacted by the Visa Application Centre. The statement reads: “UK Visas and Immigration is currently prioritising applications made under the Ukraine Family Scheme, following its launch and in response to the humanitarian crisis arising from the invasion of Ukraine.

Customers with standard applications in study, work, and family routes may experience some delays in the processing of their application. “We are still currently unable to offer PV for visitor applications in Nigeria. Standard visitor visa applications are currently taking an average of six weeks to process. “Applicants will be contacted by the Visa Application Centre (VAC) when their passport is ready for collection. They should not attend the VAC until they have been invited to do so. “Where there are extremely compassionate or compelling circumstances (for example, a medical emergency), UKVI may consider expediting specific cases. However, the bar for this is high and will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. “If a request is exceptionally urgent, applicants can contact UK Visas and Immigration for help. Please note that this is a chargeable service for overseas customers. We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause.”
