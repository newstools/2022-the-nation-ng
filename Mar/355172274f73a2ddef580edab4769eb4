MTN Nigeria has unveiled its Group-wide brand identity with a simplified and innovative logo. Unveiling the logo in Lagos, the telecoms company also announced its brand repositioning using a contemplative slogan – “What Are We Doing Today?”, which also articulated the context behind the new logo. The event was attended by  MTN’s leadership team, celebrities and well-established opinion leaders across relevant industries, media stakeholders and high-value customers. It is  the second brand overhaul since the MTN Group was founded in 1994. Back in 2004, the changes made to the brand resulted in MTN taking ownership of the colour yellow that is now synonymous with MTN. It also helped to elevate the brand to where it is today, recognised as the most valuable in Africa. The rebranding is an extension and visual representation of MTN Group’s refreshed strategy, dubbed Ambition 2025 and is premised on leading digital solutions for Africa’s progress.   ‘$42b deals sealed at IATF2021’     Minister praises manufacturing of LNG stove     VIN: Customs, agents meeting ends in deadlock   Through the delivery of the strategy, MTN says it aims to accelerate growth by building the largest and most valuable platform businesses and driving its industry leading connectivity operations.
