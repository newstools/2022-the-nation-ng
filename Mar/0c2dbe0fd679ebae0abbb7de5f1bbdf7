Roman Abramovich suffers ‘suspected poisoning’…     Russia eyes Asia for oil exports as Europe turns away     NATO activates chemical, nuclear defence elements amid…   “Preferably avoid touching any surface,” Kuleba said. It comes as discussions between Ukrainian and Russian delegations are set to continue in Turkey on Tuesday. In more than a month of war, negotiators from Ukraine and Russia have met three times in the border region of Belarus, talks then shifted online. On Sunday, the Turkish presidential office named Istanbul as the venue for the next talks. According to him, face-to-face meeting would allow for more substantive negotiations than a video link.
