Olayomi Koiki, spokesman of Yoruba Nation agitator, Sunday Adeyemo, aka Sunday Igboho, has said his principal won’t grant interviews for now until he (Igboho) has rested well. Igboho, who was recently released conditionally, cannot leave Benin Republic until the completion of his case. Koiki spoke during a Facebook Live monitored by The Nation. He spoke against the backdrop of trending video of his principal seen relaxing in his apartment at Benin Republic. In the video seen by The Nation, Igboho was seen discussing the war between Ukraine and Russia.   Zamfara to recruit 515 healthcare professionals to improve…     NRC apologises, blames technical hitch for Lagos-Ibadan…     APC dares INEC, vows to hold March 26 convention   “Let’s hope that this Ukraine crisis won’t lead to a third world war. May God not let us witness war in the world,” Igboho said. But reacting, Koiki said: “Igboho is yet to grant any media interview. For now, Igboho is not going to speak. He will speak when he has rested well and more convenient. “The viral video you all saw was not recorded in secrecy. Igboho authorised it, he just wanted to show his supporters that he is fine and in good spirit. Igboho is on Instagram, and the video was shared there. “This is to correct the impression that people are saying Igboho has said something since he left detention. “He told me to inform supporters that he’s faring well, and I should announce to you all that he will speak to everyone at a much convenient time. Igboho is in good spirit.”
