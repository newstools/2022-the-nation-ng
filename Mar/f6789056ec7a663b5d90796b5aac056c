China has criticised the U.S. ban on Russian oil, gas and coal imports in response to the Ukraine war. “Waving the big stick of sanctions will not bring us peace or security,” Foreign Office spokesperson Zhao Lijian told the press in Beijing on Wednesday. “They will only cause severe difficulties for the economy and the livelihood of relevant countries. “Everyone will lose from this scenario and sanctions will only enhance division and confrontation.’’ China and Russia maintain good cooperation in the energy sector, he said. “We will continue to conduct normal trade cooperation,’’ the spokesman said.   Our sanctions will hurt you, Russia warns West     Moscow stops export of foreign-made medical products     U.S., UK announce ban on Russian oil imports   On possible punitive actions by the U.S. if Chinese banks and companies did not comply with other sanctions already imposed earlier, the spokesperson said China would take “all necessary measures’’ to resolutely defend the legitimate interests of Chinese companies and individuals. China rejects all unilateral sanctions and an extension of the U.S. side’s jurisdiction beyond U.S. territory, Zhao said. In dealing with the Ukraine issue and Russia, the U.S. should take China’s concerns seriously and avoid undermining China’s rights and interests. China has routinely blocked market access to companies that have not toed the line on its Taiwan policy. Recently, it blocked multiple imports from Australia after Canberra demanded a probe into whether the Coronavirus pandemic originated in China. (dpa/NAN)
