Former Speaker of the Plateau State House of Assembly Abok Nuhu Ayuba, has decamped from the All Progressives Congress APC to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). A statement signed by Itse Samuel Kaze, Media Assistant to Abok Nuhu Ayuba, reads that Ayuba, on March 18th, officially tended his letter of resignation from the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC), while presenting a letter of intent, seeking to return to his earlier party, the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), at the party’s Local Government Secretariat in Angware, Jos East. Abok, who was sacked by members of the Assembly after he fell out with Governor Simon Lalong, added that his action became necessary in other to save  the Local Government and the State from failed leadership that will lead to a state of total collapse if allowed. Appreciating the PDP for considering and accepting his intention in a warm welcome, Abok said, “I stand before you, deeply touched and inspired by your generous words of acceptance and encouragement.
