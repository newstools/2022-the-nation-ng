Dancehall artiste, Cynthia Morgan aka Madrina has dismissed the bible as inaccurate and full of contradictions.. On her Insta story, she argued the Holy Book is grossly flawed and can’t be relied on. Describing it as ‘inaccurate and unreliable’, the songstress said she found it puzzling that most pastors who have supposedly read the Bible from first book to its last are yet to realize the discrepancies therein.   Annie Idibia begs 2baba for a decade of faithfulness     AMVCA: Funke Akindele dances as ‘Omo Ghetto’…     Simi makes history with 100 million streams on Audiomack   So much so that they are yet to explain same to their followers. “THE BIBLE IS INACCURATE AND UNRELIABLE AND IT BAFFLES ME THAT MOST OF THESE PASTORS THAT CLAIM THAT THEY’VE READ THIS BOOK FROM GENESIS TO REVELATION IN DIFFERENT OCCASIONS ARE YET TO HIGHLIGHT THESE DISCREPANCIES TO THEIR FOLLOWERS…” she wrote.
