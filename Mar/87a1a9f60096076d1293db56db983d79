The Russian army has advanced a further 12 kilometres into eastern Ukraine and reached the border of the settlement of Nikolske near Mariupol, says Russian Ministry of Defence spokesman Igor Konashenkov. In a post on Facebook, the Ukrainian general staff said that Russia is mobilising troops in the areas of Luhansk and Donetsk. The self-proclaimed independent republics of Luhansk and Donetsk in eastern Ukraine have enjoyed the support of Russia since 2014. Prior to the Russian invasion on Feb. 24, the republics only covered a portion of the territory of the oblasts or administrative divisions, of Luhansk and Donetsk.
