Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide on Sunday decried what it described as the constant negative comments of River State Governor Nyesom Wike, saying they could wreck his political career. The foremost Igbo socio-cultural group’s comments followed its disagreement with Wike’s recent verbal assault against Governor Obaseki of Edo State. It also insinuated that Wike was somehow involved in the recent judicial travails of Ebonyi State Governor, David Umahi, but provided no proof for the allegation. Umahi was recently sacked by an Abuja High Court but has since appealed the decision, while an Ebonyi High Court ordered the governor to stay put.

It claimed that there is a “grand scheme and conspiracy” to remove the Umahi, describing it as ”a subversive and provocative invasion aimed at distracting the South East from the 2023 presidential election.” It stated this in a statement issued on Sunday by Secretary-General Ohanaeze Ndigbo worldwide, Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro. Isiguzoro said: “The verbal diarrhoea of Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State in all national issues is worrisome, and that will likely wreck his political career to a disastrous end. “Any governor who is instrumental to displacing a fellow governor will be assessed by Nigerians at the end of 2023. How can anyone derive happiness from other people’s agonies and tragedies?”
