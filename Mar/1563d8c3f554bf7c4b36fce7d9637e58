About 115 Nigerian youths yesterday stormed Ukraine Embassy, in an effort to join the country in its fight against Russia. Their move followed the call for volunteer fighters by the Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky. The youths in their large numbers visited the Ukraine Embassy in Abuja, and were directed by the embassy to put down their names in a register provided. Ironically, the youths visited the embassy on a day the Federal Government commenced the evacuation of stranded Nigerians, who fled Ukraine to neighbouring countries, following the conflict between the country and Russia.

The second secretary, Ukraine Embassy, Bohdan Soltys, confirmed the development, adding that no step had yet been taken to that effect. The volunteers are believed to be responding to a recent call by Ukrainian President, urging people around the world to join the fight. In a statement released on Sunday, the President accused the Russian army of killing civilians and praised Ukrainians for having the courage to defend themselves. He said the assault by Russia was not just “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine” but also the beginning of a war against democracy and basic human rights.
