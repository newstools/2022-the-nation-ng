Egypt head coach Carlos Queiroz has sent a message to his players ahead of their 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers games. Egypt will battle it out with Senegal in a two-legged tie later this month in what will be a repeat of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) final. The tie will determine which one of them will participate in the global showpiece which is scheduled to be hosted by Qatar last this year. With his side seeking revenge after losing to the Lions of Teranga in the AFCON final, Queiroz urged his charges to remain humble and focused in order to achieve the ‘Egyptian Dream’.

Day 15 before starting our camp,” the Portuguese tactician wrote on his official Twitter account. “Only with the same correct attitude we can succeed and fulfil the Egyptian Dream and reach our expectations and goals.  “Keeping humble, being focused, and committed to Hard Work every single second of our lives, is the only winning formula that can drive us forward to Qatar,” he added.  “Wish you all the best and good health. Don’t take it easy, don’t make it wrong, use this time to prepare and be better. Ready?” The Pharaohs are scheduled to host the Lions of Teranga in the first-leg encounter at the Cairo International Stadium in Cairo, Egypt on March 24 while the second-leg clash will then take place at the Stade Me Abdoulaye Wade in Diamniadio, Senegal on March 29.
