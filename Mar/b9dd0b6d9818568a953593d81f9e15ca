After the contest to elect a new Ooni of Ife, in my capacity as the eye of Oduduwa, I had to make peace among the contenders, to pacify the losers. “When Adedoyin was celebrating his 60th birthday, I was invited to grace the occasion in 2019. I went there in my capacity as the eye of Oduduwa to pacify him for losing in the contest for Ooni of Ife. I went there and left; that was the only time I met him, so, linking me with ritual killing is political. I am a prince of Ibadan land. We do not do such things here. Anyone interested should come and investigate. My doors are open.”
