Brent was a talented photographer and filmmaker who had contributed to The New York Times over the years,” NYTimes said in a statement posted on Twitter. “Though he had contributed to The Times in the past (most recently in 2015), he was not on assignment for any desk at The Times in Ukraine. Early reports that he worked for Times circulated because he was wearing a Times press badge that had been issued for an assignment many years ago,” the statement read. “Another journalist was wounded. We are currently trying to take the victim out of the combat zone,” Kyiv regional police chief Andriy Nyebytov said in a statement on Sunday.   NewsNow
