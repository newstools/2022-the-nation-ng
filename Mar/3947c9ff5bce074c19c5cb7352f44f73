Thomas Tuchel has slammed the Chelsea fans who chanted Roman Abramovich’s name during a minute’s applause for war-torn Ukraine before Saturday’s 4-0 win against Burnley. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Premier League clubs held a pre-match moment of solidarity with the country before every game this weekend and the majority of fans joined the applause at Turf Moor. However, a section of the travelling Chelsea support interrupted the applause to sing the name of the club’s Russian owner.

However, Chelsea boss Tuchel was disappointed with the fans who chose not to respect the show of support for Ukraine. “It’s not the moment to do this. If we show solidarity we show solidarity and we should do it together,” he said. “We take the knee together. If an important person from our club or another club unfortunately dies we have a minute of respect.”
