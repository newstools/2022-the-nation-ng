Super Eagles coach Emmanuel Amuneke said  Nigeria can  nick the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar ticket at the expense of Ghana’s Black Stars by capitalising  on their noticeable  weaknesses from  last Friday’s first leg game in Kumasi . The Eagles battled the Black Stars to a goalless draw in Kumasi last Friday and will face the same side tonight in the second leg of the playoffs in Abuja . Amuneke who was at the dugout with the rest of the Nigeria’s technical crew said a lot of things must be considered to ensure the Eagles pick the ticket. “The rivalry between Ghana and Nigeria is a very massive one. Those of us who have been privileged to play in the game in the past know how huge and important it is,” Amuneke told NFF Tv.

The whole thing remains that we must thread with caution. They are not pushovers. Basically people are looking at the Ghanaians from what they did at the last AFCON because of their early elimination. “Each game is different and what matters now is that we got a draw in Ghana. We have to go back to look at our opponents’ weak and strong points. Football has really evolved a lot. Sometimes it is not about wing play but about the ability for your players to adapt to the circumstances the game in question is bringing to them.”
