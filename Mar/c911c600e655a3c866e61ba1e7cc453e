Speaking on what she would love to see differently in Nigerian music space, the 26-year-old singer said “I think with everything in Nigeria it is just to improve the structure, because we have a lot of things in place, just creating more structure around like touring, being able to tour in the country because Nigeria is so large they are so many states that don’t get to experience concerts. So like providing a proper tourist record, creating more venues, we don’t have any concert venues in Lagos, we have milkshake centers that we are turning to concert venues so like investing into things like that or getting people that are interested in music to do that.” Lady Donli who recently released her first record in 2022 dubbed ‘Thunderstorm In Surulere,’ is part of an expanding pool of artists who are driving Nigeria’s alté (Alternative) scene. She has received several award nominations including ‘Best Alternative Song’ at the 2019 Headies award. Lady Donli holds a degree in Law from the prestigious University Of Surrey, Guildford, England. She broke into the Nigerian music space with her single ‘Cash’ which she later remixed with superstar, Davido.
