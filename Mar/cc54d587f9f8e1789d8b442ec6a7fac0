The President of the Girls Brigade Nigeria, Mrs. Stella Fabanwo has said the brigade is the most strategic organisation to help the girl child. Fabanwo, who was sworn in as the new president on Saturday, in Abuja, said that girls in the country should be encouraged to take advantage of the organisation for their own good. She said the girls’ brigade has what it takes to train the girl child, saying only a handful of girls take advantage of the organisation. “I joined the organisation when I was 9 and I can attest that it made me what I am. The trainings we are exposed to build us to a point of appreciating life better and being able to cope with motherhood. I owe success as a mother to my membership of the brigade,” she said.

Beyond that, girls are trained on strategic vocational skills that can make them excel in life,” she added. While acknowledging that many members of the brigade are successful individuals, she said, another beautiful thing about the brigade is that it helps girls to be bold, confident, and cosmopolitan. She urged parents to encourage their female children to join the organisation.
