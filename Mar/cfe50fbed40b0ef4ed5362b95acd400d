They claimed that they found the said phone on the ground along Cathedral Junction after the Presiding Magistrate, Damilola Sekoni, asked them to explain what happened.

According to him: ” I was in my house resting when the police came with my brother that I was involved in the killing of a lady with a pestle, which sounded strange to me. ” I was later told that the phone I gave my brother to make a call was stolen from a crime scene at Okuta Elerinla which also seemed strange to me.” Magistrate Sekoni later ordered the remand of the defendants at the Owo Correctional Centre and adjourned the case to March 28, 2022, for mentioning.
