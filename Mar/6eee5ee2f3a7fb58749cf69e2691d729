Napoli star Victor Osimhen is  reportedly Manchester United’s main target to replace Cristiano Ronaldo next season, but Napoli want at least €100m for their striker, according to Rai Sport. The Nigeria international has scored 11 goals in 22 appearances this term and missed almost two months of action due to a cheekbone injury. He’s scored two goals in six appearances since his return to action in January. According to Rai Sport journalist Ciro Venerato, the 22-year-old is Manchester United’s primary target to potentially Cristiano Ronaldo in 2022-23. The Portuguese striker returned to Old Trafford from Juventus in the summer in a €15m deal plus €8m add-ons. According to the report, United have already made preliminary contact with Napoli and the player’s agent, but the Partenopei value Osimhen at €100m.

Manchester United aims straight at the Nigerian, Ragnick wants the Napoli striker to replace Cristiano Ronaldo. The club and the player have already been probed, with De Laurentiis evaluating his card at 100m euros,” Domenica Sportiva claimed. In case Napoli sell the Nigeria international in the summer, Sassuolo‘s Gianluca Scamacca would become their main target in attack. The Italy international has also attracted interest from Inter and Milan. Meanwhile, a foremost Italian journalist Dario Di Gennaro has blasted Lazio fans for their racist remarks to Osimhen during the weekend’s Serie A tie. “But racists for Osimhen without anyone from the referee team saying anything. In Curva Nord the flag of Diabolik, former head ultrà and big shot of drug trafficking, killed two summers ago. But the No War banner does not enter the stadium,” Gennaro wrote on his Twitter handle.
