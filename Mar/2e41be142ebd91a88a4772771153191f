Youths of Itu/Ibiono Ibom Federal Constituency have accused Akwa Ibom State Governor Udom Emmanuel of coercing his appointees to support his preferred successor, Pastor Umo Eno. They said the governor’s choice of Eno, who is not from Itu/Ibiono Ibom Federal Constituency, but from Etinan, was against micro-zoning in the rotation of the governorship seat in Uyo Senatorial District. The youth also accused the governor of using the state resources to sponsor his candidate over other governorship aspirants. They said his action was a threat to the corporate interest of the state.

He said Uyo Senatorial District comprises three federal constituencies of Uyo, Etinan and Itu/Ibiono, lamenting that while Uyo and Etinan have each had their shot at the governorship, Itu/Ibiono Ibom has been cheated. The Commissioner for information and Strategy, Iniobong Ememobong, declined comments on the matter when our correspondent phoned him. “The Chief Press Secretary to the Governor is the right person to speak on the issue. Call him,” he said. However, the Chief Press Secretary and Senior Special Adviser to the Governor, Mr. Ekerere Udoh, didn’t not respond to text messages and phone calls from our correspondent on the allegations raised by the youth.
