A petition to remove Ye, formerly known as a Kanye West, from #TheCoachella lineup for 2022 has received 26,000 signatures. Kanye West, who is set to headline Day 3 of Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in April,has been getting stiff opposition from individuals across the world over his relentless social media shots at estranged wife Kim Kardashian, her new boyfriend Pete Davidson and Trevor Noah, among others. A Change.org petition was recently launched to remove the rapper from the festival lineup and the petition has been getting several signatures.   I’ve attempted suicide thrice – Beatrice     I’ll accept money from politicians in 2023 –…     I remain a hustler, says Rema   “We have watched Kanye harass, manipulate, and hurt Kim, Pete, and others for over a year now,” the petition, launched by user Caramello Marie, reads. “No one seems to want to stand up to him, and the ones that do, he puts under fire as well. Most recently, he has been threatening actual bodily harm to others. This is ridiculous that he is allowed to freely do this. Coachella (along with other brand names that are still working with him) should be ashamed of themselves and should not be giving him any more of a platform.” As of the early hours of March 22, the petition has gotten more than 26,000 signatures. On March 16, 2022, Kanye West was suspended from Instagram for 24 hours after one of his posts violated Instagram’s policies on hate speech, bullying, and harassment.
