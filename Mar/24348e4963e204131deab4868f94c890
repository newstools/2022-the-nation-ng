The Nigeria squad posses’ threat on us, so I will advise the coach to invite players who can last for the entire duration. Muntari has played for the national team for several years but at the moment, his game does not fit the Black Stars. “I’m being honest, he cannot play for the Black Stars for now especially our game against Nigeria. I will plead with the coaches not to invite him because he is not fit enough. People are talking about experience but I have a different view on that, at some point in time, experience do not count” “We are not talking about experience; we are talking about players who are doing well. It is about time we stop talking about experience because experience doesn’t guarantee you a loan from the bank” he added Muntari signed for Hearts of Oak in February and has made four Ghana Premier League appearances, providing one assist. He was also in top form as the Phobians beat Asante Kotoko to win the President Cup.
