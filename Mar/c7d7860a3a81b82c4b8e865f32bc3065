Japan qualified for a seventh successive World Cup after beating Australia 2-0 in Sydney. The result also qualified Saudi Arabia from Asia Group B. Kaoru Mitoma’s late double secured Japan’s qualification for a seventh straight World Cup finals yesterday as the Samurai Blue beat Australia 2-0 in Sydney to ensure Saudi Arabia also qualified for the finals in Qatar. Mitoma replaced Takumi Minamino in the 84th minute and claimed a quick-fire brace that guaranteed Hajime Moriyasu’s side a top-two finish in Group B of Asia’s preliminaries and sealed Saudi Arabia’s World Cup spot. The Australians cannot finish higher than third and will face the third-place finisher in Group A in a playoff, with the winners taking on the fifth-best South American side for a berth at the finals. Saudi Arabia, who played China in Sharjah later yesterday, has amassed 19 points and are now certain to finish no lower than second.     Bankers kick-out string of offers for Chelsea     Nigerian boxer Gifted Cole face-off with Mexican     Salah vows revenge as Egypt ,Senegal battle   Qualified Teams for Qatar 2022 Hosts: Qatar Europe: Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, England, France, Germany, Netherlands, Serbia, Spain,Switzerland.
