Sports supporter, Prince Adewole Adebayo has pledged his support towards the title defense of World Boxing Federation (WBF) super featherweight champion Ridwan ‘Scorpion’ Oyekola. He made the pledge while hosting Oyekola, his manager, Sola ‘Ford’ Ayodele along with the former Ekiti State governor, Segun Oni, and former Minister of Youth and Sports, Solomon Dalung and Core Afrique Boxing Promotions (COABOX) crew to his country home in Ondo town. The boxing lover described boxing as a big avenue for the nation to rule the world considering the huge boxing talents the country blessed Nigeria by God.

In his response, Ayodele presented Scorpion’s two belts to Adebayo and thanked him for his encouragement and support to the boxing sport, while also expressing excitement about meeting with the Ondo born legal icon, whom he described as a youth role model. Ex-governor Segun Oni and former Minister of Youth and Sports, Solomon Dalung also took turns to encourage the boxer while pledging their support for his title defense.
