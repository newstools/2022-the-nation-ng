He said: “Sequel to recent Customs/Stakeholders town hall meeting held in Lagos on VIN-Valuation, the Comptroller-General Customs having listened to public outcry, has graciously approved one  month window to enable clearing the backlog of vehicles held up in the ports as a result of strike action. “Meanwhile, uniform application of rebates will be used for all vehicles using correct values for assessment during the exercise. For the avoidance of doubt, the VIN-Valuation protocol is still in operation as reviews and updates are being captured in our systems to reflect the genuine concerns of stakeholders.” Bomodi, however, stated that the service  as a responsive and responsible government agency,  will sustain its  consultations with stakeholders in line with  Article 2 of WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement for a smoother Customs Stakeholders relationship.
