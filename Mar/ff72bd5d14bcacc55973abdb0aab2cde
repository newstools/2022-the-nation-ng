A Coalition of 40 northern youth groups, under the aegis of Unified Northern Nigeria Youths Forum, has urged the Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele to contest for presidency come 2023,  saying he has transformed the North with several CBN agricultural interventions. One of the leaders of the group, Muhammad Salisu Danlami at a 2023 stakeholders consultation meeting held in Bauchi on Friday, said the CBN governor will perform better than past presidents who did little or nothing as regards development in the northern region.   2023: Only SGS has notified APC of intent to contest Katsina…     Three killed, 16 injured in Bauchi ghastly accident     NASC confiscates vegetable seeds for non compliance in…   In his words ” We have tried politicians in the past, what did they do to bring development in our region? Agriculture is our main occupation in the North but this man has spent hugely on our farmers. We can see what is coming out from rice in Nigeria, see Kebbi, Katsina, Bauchi, and others. They produce thousands of tons of rice.” “He has released billions of Naira for local production of wheat and Nigeria will soon become one of the major producers. We are saying if someone like Emefieli becomes the president of Nigeria, you can imagine the kind of development that will come.” Bauchi Co-ordinator, Anas Ahmad, said farmers in the state have benefited from Emefiele’s achievements. “Please note that Dr. Godwin Emefiele is fully accepted here in Bauchi State because of his numerous intervention programmes, which include the establishment of NIRSAL Northeast Headquarters in Bauchi, making it easy for our teaming young entrepreneurs and small business owners to access loans and finance their businesses,” he said.
