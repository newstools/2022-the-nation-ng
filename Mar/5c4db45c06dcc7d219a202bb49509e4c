The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has said it raked in N8.6 billion from the sale of the 2022 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) and Direct Entry (DE) forms. It made the revenue from the sale of the forms at N4,700 per applicant to the 1,837,011 candidates it successfully captured at the close of the registration which held nationwide between February 19 and March 26. These were contained in the latest weekly bulletin by JAMB, which was released on Sunday night. Out of the lump sum, 776 computer-based test (CBT) centres that took part in the exercise will share an estimated amount of N1.3 billion at the rate of N700 per candidate registered by each of the centres. The UTME/DE examinations have been scheduled to hold from May 6 to May 16. JAMB also pledged support for the CBT centre owners over the sudden increase in the prices of diesel and the erratic power supply suffered nationwide recently.

It promised to seek necessary approvals to grant them the necessary support, as may be deemed appropriate. JAMB said an estimated 1.5 million candidates had been targeted for registration during the exercise with an estimated 50,000 candidates per day. JAMB’s Head of Media and Protocol, Fabian Benjamin, said the figure of the registered had exceeded the body’s expectation. He recalled that unlike in the past, when the adoption of the National Identification Number (NIN) as a mandatory condition for applicants had constituted a challenge to the system, there were little or no complaints in the just-concluded exercise.     Benjamin hailed the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) for a seamless exercise, seeking more synergy with the organisation and other relevant agencies.
