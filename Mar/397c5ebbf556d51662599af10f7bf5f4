The Secretary to Katsina State Government (SSG), Dr Mustapha Inuwa, has distanced himself from any form of untoward connection with bandits and insecurity in the state. Inuwa made the clarification while responding to questions from newsmen on Wednesday in Katsina after his declaration of interest to run for the governorship election. Earlier, he had presented a letter of notification of his ambition to the state’s leadership of the All Progressive Congress (APC). “Some of my relatives were kidnapped by the bandits. We have to contribute money before they were released. “If I have a hand in the insecurity issue, my relatives wouldn’t have been kidnapped. Those circulating such rumours are not God-fearing people. They don’t mind saying anything.

I told them that I will stay with them in their camp, ‘let their leader go and discuss with Gov. Aminu Masari’. “I told them that if their leader returned, they should allow me to go, and if he didn’t return, whatever was done to him they should do to me — I did that. “The first time we were going to meet these people, the Commissioner of Police said he was not going. I told him I was always ready for death, as I am always in a white dress. “I was told that the intention was to kill me. Only God saved me. And I didn’t tell anyone I was going there. I met over 30 bandits with guns,” Inuwa said. He explained that there was no reason for him to be part of a problem when he was among the people trying to find a lasting solution. “There is no benefit in that,” he said. (NAN)
