Former President Goodluck Jonathan has urged security agencies to scale up efforts to prevent the reoccurrence of the terror attack on the Kaduna train. He commiserated with the families of the bereaved and sent condolences to the victims. In a series of tweets, Jonathan said: “I commiserate with the victims of Monday’s Abuja-Kaduna train attack, the families of the deceased, and other Nigerians who have been affected, in one way or the other, by recent events in our country, driven by the violent activities of bandits and terrorists.   Police defuse explosive in Rigasa train community     Soldier ‘abandoned’ during operation coward…     PDP should be ashamed of what it did to Nigerians in 16…   “My thoughts are with them even as I pray that all those abducted will be rescued and reunited with their families, soon. “I urge Nigerians to be vigilant, optimistic, and not to succumb to pessimism and fear. “I call on the security and intelligence services to scale up their efforts and ensure that perpetrators of these dastardly crimes are served with justice, and restore normalcy to our land.”
