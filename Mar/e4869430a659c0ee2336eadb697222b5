The Kaduna State Government has inaugurated Local Emergency Committees (LEMC) to manage disasters across the 23 local government areas of the state. Inaugurating the committee in Kaduna yesterday, Governor Nasir El-Rufai said it would mitigate emergencies through actions that would reduce exposure to hazardous events. He said this would be achieved through educating owners of business outfits and members of public on simple measures they could take to reduce losses and injuries in times of disasters. Represented by the Commissioner for Human Services and Social Development Hafsat Baba, he explained that the LEMCs would prepare the communities to be ready to face emerging threats that had not been mitigated. “I hope that inaugurating the LEMCs will increase response to disaster management, and aid risk reduction through early warning and early response,” he explained.   ‘Protect dignity of SGBV survivors in your reporting’     Minister urges ITF, others to tackle unemployment     INEC registers 111,762 voters in Adamawa   The Executive Secretary, Kaduna State Emergency Management Agency (KADSEMA) Muhammed Mukaddas, said the LEMCs are strategically structured to strengthen communities to take ownership of their disaster management systems.
