The Forum of Buhari Support Groups (FOBSG) has appealed to  All Progressives Congress (APC) members to unite ahead of 2023 elections to achieve the feat of 2015 and 2019. National Chairman of the Forum Dr Abiso Kabir, who spoke  yesterday at a news briefing in Abuja, appealed to the party leadership  to save APC from anarchy by shunning acts that could divide it. Kabir called on party leaders to avoid promoting personal interests above the interests of over 40 million registered members of APC. He called on key stakeholders to unite behind President Muhammadu Buhari in his effort to find a solution to problems of the party.

According to him, the forum believes that progress can only be achieved if all sides are willing to sacrifice for  the party. “This is very critical time for our party to decide its future, and everything must be done to avoid truncating the dream of Nigerians who have faith in the future of our country …” The forum appealed to those aspiring to lead the party to be decent and unite. Kabir said: “As support groups, with the largest nationwide spread, we are determined to replicate the feats of 2015 and 2019 in mobilising popular support for the party and its candidates in the next general election’’.
