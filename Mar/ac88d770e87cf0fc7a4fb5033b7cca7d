Despite sparingly used in the on-going campaign, Kelechi Iheanacho believes he would continue to fight for his place in the Leicester City squad. Leicester made it two top-flight victories in a week on Saturday as Harvey Barnes struck the only goal of the game in a 1-0 success over Leeds United at King Power Stadium. That 67th -minute winner came after a neat one-two with Iheanacho and the Nigerian was delighted with the points. “It’s so, so important,” City’s No.14 told LCFC TV. “It’s a massive victory for us. I think we deserved the win because we worked hard in the first half to keep a clean sheet. Then, in the second half, we came out stronger and we held them and we got the goal.”   Egypt vs. Senegal: Queiroz issues clarion call to Salah,…     WORLD CUP PLAYOFFS: Brentford celebrate Onyeka’s…     Super Eagles: Udeze, Siasia knock Eguavoen   The former Manchester City forward was a second-half substitute, playing his own part in a result which aids Leicester’s attempts to continue climbing the standings, especially with up to three games in hand on some of the sides around them. “I just needed to play my football,” Iheanacho explained, providing an insight into manager Brendan Rodgers’ words to him before joining the action. “I just needed to go and fight and help my teammates and that’s exactly what I did. “He encouraged me a lot and I got on the pitch, I was helping my mates out, and creating is so, so important – and so is the spirit and togetherness. We fought until the end to get the victory.”
