Charity organisations have warned that world food supplies could be endangered as a knock-on effect of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, saying Middle Eastern and Asian nations rely on agricultural exports from the warring parties. Both Ukraine and Russia are key suppliers of agricultural goods, but harvests are now endangered in Ukraine and stuck in Russia due to sanctions. More than half of the foodstuff used by the UN World Food Programme (WFP) in crisis regions originates from Ukraine. Martin Frick, the Director of the Berlin office of the WFP, said “there are already 276 million people suffering from acute hunger in 81 countries. The world simply can’t afford another conflict.

The same for Tunisia. “Poor people in both countries rely heavily on bread as a source of nutrition. It is subsidised and thus relatively widely available.” However, experts in Tunisia are now warning about price hikes due to the war and the country was looking for other sources of wheat, like Argentina or Romania. But it remains unclear whether those sources will be able to meet demand. (dpa/NAN)
