THE Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) has granted returnees from Ukraine a waiver from the 48 hours pre-departure COVID -19 PCR test requirements, as the Federal Government begins the evacuation of Nigerians from war-torn country today. Besides, the returnees, according to the NCAA, have also been granted waiver from the requirement which prescribes that they carry out pre-departure filling of the Nigerian International Travel Portal (NITP), payment for repeat tests in the country and generate permits to fly. In a letter to international airlines operating into Nigeria, NCAA’s Director General, Captain Musa Nuhu, said the waiver came against the background of ongoing hostilities in Ukraine.

Nuhu said: “Passengers will, however, be required to fill the Nigerian International Travel Portal upon their arrival in Nigeria with the assistance of the Port Health Services. “Upon arrival in Nigeria, passengers will be directed by the Port Health Services to designated government laboratories for COVID -19 test. “The COVID -19 PCR test, which must be done within 24 hours of arrival, will be at no cost to the passengers.”
