A Yaba Magistrates’ Court in Lagos has remanded for 30 days a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) driver, Mr. Andrew Nice Ominnikoron, suspected of involvement in the death of his passenger, Oluwabamise Ayanwole. Magistrate O. A. Salawu made the order following an application by the State Criminal Investigation Department (CID), Yaba, Lagos. Salawu, who stood in for Chief Magistrate Tunbosun Adedayo, ruled that Ominnikoron, 42, be kept in the custody of the Nigerian Correctional Services’ (NCoS) Ikoyi facility pending advice on the matter from the Lagos State Directorate of Public Prosecution (DPP).

The charge, seen by The Nation, accused Ominnikoron of murder, misconduct towards a corpse, sexual assault and interference with a corpse.
