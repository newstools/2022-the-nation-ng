Veteran actor Richard Mofe-Damijo (RMD) has opened up on a pastoral call on his life which he has been running away from. He narrated how several persons always shared their dreams where they saw him as a pastor. RMD confessed to have willfully avoided the pulpit for many years after having taught in Sunday school for over 15 years. But he noted the call always has a way of seeking him out in movie roles. The 60-year-old thespian asked fans to look out for him in the movie, “Cold” where he once again plays the character of a man of God. RMD wrote: “True Story! There was a time when for every other day or week, somebody would tell me they had a dream where they saw me as a pastor. Having taught Sunday school for over 15 years it was not far-fetched.
