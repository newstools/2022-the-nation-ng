The European Union would be “stronger” with Ukraine as a member, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday in an address to the European Parliament. Zelenskyy’s comments came a day after he signed an official application for Ukraine to join the E.U. Ukrainians, Zelesnkyy said, “are just fighting for our land and for our freedom,” he said. “No one will break us. We are strong. We are Ukrainians.” But as Ukraine fights “for survival,” he said the country is also “fighting to be equal members of Europe.”   Sanwo-Olu: Construction of Badagry seaport starts June     Imo APC dispute: Okorocha, Uzodinma know fate as Supreme…     Ukraine says 70 soldiers killed as Russian convoy heads for…   “With us, the European Union will definitely be stronger,” he said, adding: “Without you, Ukraine will be lonely.” “We have proven our strength.
