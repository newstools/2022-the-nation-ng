Manchester United’s board are leaning towards hiring Erik ten Hag this summer after the Dutchman overtook Thomas Tuchel and Mauricio Pochettino in the race to become the Red Devils’ next manager. The Ajax boss is a leading candidate for the role at Old Trafford but there had been concerns over his English and lack of Premier League experience. United have long wanted to appoint Pochettino and the Argentine is expected to be sacked following the PSG’s abysmal Champions League exit to Real Madrid, meaning United would not need to pay a compensation fee to hire the former Tottenham manager.

According to the MEN, that’s led to United favouring the appointment of Ten Hag as they admire his ability to build teams from scratch. The Dutchman guided Ajax to their first league title in five years in 2017 while they beat Juventus and Real Madrid on their way to the Champions League semi-finals in 2018. Ten Hag has maintained Ajax’s status as a Champions League club following the sale of Frankie De Jong, Donny van de Beek and Mathijs De Ligt.
