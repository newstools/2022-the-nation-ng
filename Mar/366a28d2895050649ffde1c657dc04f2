A former Super Eagles coach, Christian Chukwu, is optimistic about the Super Eagles’ qualification for the 2022 FIFA World Cup after their play-off fixture with Ghana’s Black Stars. Chukwu told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Enugu yesterday that he was “highly hopeful” of victory for the Super Eagles at the end of the two-leg encounter.  “I am optimistic of the national team’s victory. I am already praying and mobilising local support for their victory,” the retired Chukwu who was an assistant coach when Nigeria made her debut at the USA 1994 finals, said. He challenged the team’s coaching crew to deploy superior technical and tactical pattern of play as the Black Stars would definitely try to pull some surprises against the Super Eagles. He also said he was sure Nigerians would rise in full support of the team, as “they have been supporting the Super Eagles all along and they will do same this time”.
