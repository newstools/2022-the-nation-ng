Now, I promise to work twice as hard as I originally intended. I promise to meet the yearning and aspirations of all our young people to run a modern government. “As it stands, this is a clarion call. This is why, I make this promise: ‘When I become President on the 29th of May 2023, all the Ministers of State in my Cabinet will be experienced young people who are under the age of 35.’ “We have our work cut out for us.
