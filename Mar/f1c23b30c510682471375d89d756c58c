In what appears to be a joke, Ghanaian actress Nadia Buari has unveiled colleague Van Vicker as the father of her kids. The video shared on the actress’ Instagram page has since been deleted. She hinted to fans she was about to provide the answer to the question that’s been bugging their minds for ages. With Van Vicker’s backing the mother of four as she spoke, she said: “Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, butter cakes, families; a lot of you have been asking me to reveal the identity of the father of my kids. “Today, I have a surprise for you. Yes, you guessed right. I am about to reveal the man who gave me four adorable queens. “Ladies and gentlemen drum roll…Tah dah!” Immediately, the actor turned to face the camera and said: “Hello! Hello everybody.”   Why I bowed for Wizkid, by Woli Arole     Skitmaker Lasisi Elenu loses mum     Davido employs Morgan Freeman for O2 Arena commercial   “Okay? What are you doing?” Buari queried. Touching his beards, the actor responded: “I’m feeling myself.” “That’s not the plan Van. Tell them about yourself. Tell me about …..,” the 39-year-old actress said. He replied: “My name is Van Vicker. I’m an actor.” She cuts in saying: “No, not that part.” Eventually, they burst into hysterical laughter. Much isn’t known about the Sekondi-Takoradi-born film star’s marital life as she has always kept it totally off social media. However, in 2019, Buari revealed in an interview that she’s married and has four kids. But she didn’t disclose the identity of her husband.
