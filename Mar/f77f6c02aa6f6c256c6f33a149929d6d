A Federal High Court in Abuja on Wednesday admitted in evidence a letter from the office of National Security Adviser (NSA) in the ongoing trial of former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode. The letter, according to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) contains details of how Fani-Kayode got N26million from the office of the NSA. The EFCC is prosecuting Fani-Kayode on a five-count charge bordering on criminal breach of trust and money laundering in relation to the N26million he allegedly got from the office of the NSA. On Tuesday, lead prosecuting lawyer, Farouk Abdullah, invited Mohammed Goji, an official of the EFCC, who continued his testimony as the third prosecution witness. Goji told the court that he has a certified true copy (CTC) of a letter from the office of NSA to EFCC, detailing payments allegedly made to Fani- Kayode.

Balogun urged the court to grant an adjournment to enable him cross examine the witness who began his testimony about a year ago. He said he need time to run through the witness’ testimony. Justice John Tsoho acceded to Baologun’s request, noting that since it is a criminal case, the defence required sufficient time to prepare. Justice Tsoho then adjourned till May 3 for the defence to cross-examine Goji.
