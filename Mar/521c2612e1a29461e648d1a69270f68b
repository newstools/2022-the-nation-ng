Otto Wallin is the “most intriguing” opponent available to face Anthony Joshua if the Brit’s rematch with Oleksandr Usyk is delayed, according to the Swedish heavyweight’s promoter. Joshua activated a rematch clause to fight again for the WBA, IBF and WBO heavyweight titles after Usyk stunned him last September to take the belts, but the Ukrainian has returned to his homeland amid the country’s ongoing invasion by Russia. With a timeline for Usyk’s return to the ring unclear, Joshua could opt to seek an interim fight before looking to take up the rematch at a later date. Wallin, whose only career defeat came in a points loss to Tyson Fury in 2019, had been set to fight Dillian Whyte last October before the Brit was forced to withdraw with a shoulder injury. The Swede took his record to 23-1 as he claimed his first victory in Britain against Kamil Sokolowski in Cardiff last month, and his promoter Dmitry Salita is confident Wallin could cause an upset against Joshua.
