Our dream is that EKSU continues to lead and serve as an example and pacesetting institution and this laudable Prize Endowment is our latest initiative in this direction. At a time in our country where entertainment and other initiatives are being heavily incentivized, EKSU and its Alumni is helping to refocus our view in the direction of what is perhaps the most important area of human endeavour which is learning through an exemplary programme such as this. This is significant for our national growth and renewal,” they said.
