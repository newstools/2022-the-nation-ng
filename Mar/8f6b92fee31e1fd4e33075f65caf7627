A cleric, Prophet Isaac Moses, has urged Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, not to contest for the 2023 presidency against former Lagos Governor Asiwaju Bola Tinubu. The cleric, of the Amazing Revelation Divine Ministry Suleja, Niger State, said this would be tantamount to betrayal to Tinubu, who he described as the Vice President’s mentor. Speaking with reporters in Abuja on Thursday, Moses said any attempt by Osinbajo to turn his back against Tinubu could spell the end of his political career. Ahead of next year’s presidential election, Tinubu has openly declared his intention to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari. With his quest gathering momentum, there has been a clamour in some quarters for Osinbajo to join in the race.

He is loved and respected in the Christian body. We see him as an epitome of holiness. However, recent happenings have given us serious cause for concern. “For example, he has failed to out-rightly deny nurturing a presidential ambition. This is un-Christly. By now, he should have cleared the air. But if he wants to carry on with this ‘list ’ for power, I am sorry for him. “Tinubu, despite being a Muslim, has been the pillar on which Osinbajo stood on over the years. It will be suicidal to go against him. I repeat, it is a suicide mission. “Osinbajo’s time will come. He shouldn’t jeopardize God’s purposes for his life. He makes all things beautiful in his time,” Moses said.
