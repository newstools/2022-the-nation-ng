From the profit, the Company Board of Directors approved dividend of N1.80 per share translating to N1.18 billion. Babayo added that the firm closed the year 2021 as a net gainer in the transfer window in all quarters, stating that it was an outstanding feat, no doubt. He said: “Out of 9,139 individuals that expressed interest to migrate their account to Premium Pension, 4,159 were transferred successfully, representing a conversion rate of 46 per cent. Those not transferred, as at the end of the year, was because of delays with data recapture, the only prerequisite for the process.” According to him, for the entire year, a total of N16.05 billion was transferred to Premium Pension, representing 9.35 per cent of the total assets transferred within the industry. Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of PPL Mr. Umar Sanda Mairami thanked the board for their support to the management team and staff of the company towards uplifting the performance geared towards building a robust PFA. He further assured that the company would be consistent in offering premium experience to its members.
