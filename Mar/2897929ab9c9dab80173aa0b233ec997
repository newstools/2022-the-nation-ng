The presidential ambition of Bola Tinubu has been described as God’s intervention to take Nigeria out of economic doom. Executive Chairman of Amuwo-Odofin Local Government Valentine Buraimoh said God sent Tinubu to bail Nigeria out of the woods. Buraimoh spoke when the National Council of Women’s Societies (NCWS) presented equipment to the council’s health facility. The council chair noted that the event started late because of power outage, and he reminded the gathering that Tinubu planned an independent power for Lagos while he was governor from 1999 to 2007.

State President of NCWS Alhaja S.B. Agoro, said: “We must all work hard to ensure Tinubu becomes the next president of Nigeria.”
