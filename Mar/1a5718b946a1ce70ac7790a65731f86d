Fast rising singer, Lawal Bolaji aka BJ Bantin has recounted how his teachers and classmates in primary school influenced his musical career. The budding act, who released his latest single ‘After Party,’ in a chat with The Nation, narrated his musical journey saying, “I started music when I was a kid, then I was 8 years old, I was inspired by the kind of music my dad played at home. So, whenever I get to the classroom instead of singing multiplication times table, I’ll be singing ‘shebi you be Danfo driver.’ I’m very sure none of my classmates and teachers can forget this. I memorized music my dad plays then in the house, like Akon, 50cent, 2face, K1 de ultimate, Ayuba and Obesere.”   Davido laments high cost of clearing Lamborghini     Tony Odili challenges young musicians on forgiveness     Creating social media content isn’t easy, B.I Benard   Continuing, BJ Bantin said, “I got inspired most time by my fellow pupils in my primary school because they hail me and laugh at me whenever I sing and my teachers talk about me a lot calling me an unserious boy, that all I love to do is to sing.” As the singer prepares for the release of his Extended Play entitled ’Sounds and Dreams,’ BJ Bantin described his genre of music as Afrobeats saying he got his stage name by providence through an established act while he was barely eight-years-old.
