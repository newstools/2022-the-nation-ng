Former Senate President Dr Bukola Saraki has told delegates in Katsina State that he is the most qualified of all PDP aspirants and deserve their votes. Saraki, who spoke in Katsina through his Contact and Advocacy Council (SCAC), led by Prof Iyorwuese Hagher, a former minister, said he was the candidate for all Nigerians. He added that Nigerians wanted a president that was a true democrat and not just a civilian detector. ’’They want a president who has ears to listen; a president like the late President Yar’adua and that is why coming here is such a sensitive thing’’.

We need somebody who has courage because Nigerians have suffered so badly. Katsina State alone has suffered more than most states in this country because your future is compromised’’. ‘’Loans have been taken that your great-grandchildren will have to pay, yet these children are not in school. “Katsina has the second-highest number of children out of school in Nigeria at the time when APC was in government. What were they doing’’? Hagher said ‘Saraki can wipe out the tears of Nigerians because he understands what diversity means,’ adding that         ‘Nigerians have suffered because people have forgotten that the country is a diverse one, where people of different ethnic groups live together.’
