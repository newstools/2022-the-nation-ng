Continuing the Afropop vocalist said, “Though, it’s performing on the streets for Los Angeles that has been the most impactful for me. There, it’s just a mic, and a guitar and nothing else. You feel naked, and you have to have a genuine connection with the listener, or they will just leave. So, to me, that’s the most honest experience I have heard. Performing on the streets of LA and I used to do it for three hours at a time.”   2022 AMVCA: Larry Gaaga, others battle for N1m prize, Best…     Chocolate City’s signee, Noon Dave debuts with Brunch     AMAA partners StarTimes to reward filmmakers at 2022 short…   Born in New York City by Nigerian parents, Michael O carries the flag of Nigeria high anywhere he goes and has since garnered reverence as a significant force in today’s music scene.
