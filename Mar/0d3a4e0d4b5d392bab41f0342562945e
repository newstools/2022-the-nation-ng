LAGOS State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu and his Ogun state counterpart, Governor Dapo Abiodun were two of the close associates of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, who have previewed the Seun Oloketuyi’s latest biopic titled Last Man Standing. On Thursday, March 17, a select number of Asiwaju Tinubu’s associates were hosted to a private screening of the biopic in Abuja. The private screening also had personalities and political big wigs like Chief Bisi Akande, and a few other political associates of Tinubu.   Sikiru Ayinde Barrister: K1 consolidates Fuji…     Afrobeats not there yet, says Obi Asika     2022 AMVCA: Eight things to expect at 8th edition   Speaking on the event, Oloketuyi explained that the private screening was not part of the original plan. “We had planned to simply hold a premiere at the end of March, but a lot of things informed this private screening. First was the fact that people were talking about the movie a lot and both cast and crew were worried that the film may be misinterpreted, misrepresented or even maligned before it was made public. We also needed to be sure that we had gotten things right. Based on the remarks I got from Asiwaju’s close associates, people who know him well, have worked with him, and can tell you facts about his life, I think we have done a good thing that we can be proud of.” He added that “As I said before, the movie is not a political material but a record of facts in history. I think people are getting tired of watching only feel-good movies, drama, comedy, and other genres. As an industry, we are now waking up to our responsibilities as gatekeepers of history like the bards of old.” ‘Last Man Standing’ is directed by Tunde Laoye and features Lateef Adedimeji, Gbenga Adeyinka, Jide Kosoko, Madam Kofo, Shushu Abubakar, Sam Olatunji, and many others.
