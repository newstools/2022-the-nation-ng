Senate President Ahmad Lawan has said the success the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) recorded during last Saturday’s national convention was a big disappointment to naysayers who expected the party to fail. But he said opposition lawmakers in the Upper Chamber have better prospects by becoming members of the APC. Lawan stated these while congratulating Senators Abdullahi Adamu and Abubakar Kyari on their election as APC National Chairman and Deputy National Chairman (North). In a congratulatory message, he said: “Senator Abdullahi Adamu was returned elected as the new National Chairman of the APC for four years. “Another distinguished member of this Senate, Abubakar Kyari, representing Borno North, was also returned elected as the Deputy National Chairman (North) of the APC.   ‘$14b lost annually to farmer-herder clashes’     2023: PDP groups clash over zoning     Zoning alone can’t produce desirable candidate – Abaribe   “These two distinguished senators are now in charge of our party in Nigeria and beyond. “It is a very good development for the legislature, the National Assembly and, particularly, the Senate, because these are our exports. “On behalf of all of us in this Senate, I want to congratulate our colleagues, the new National Chairman and Deputy National Chairman of the APC. We wish them God’s guidance and protection as they steer the ship of the new APC.” Commenting on the success of the just-concluded national convention of the party, Lawan said: “It was a night of unity for APC members, supporters, lovers and friends. “But, of course, it was a night of disappointment for those who felt the APC would never conduct a convention, and a successful one at that.” “For our colleagues (opposition lawmakers), you have better prospects with the APC, and our doors are open.”
