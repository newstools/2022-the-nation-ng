The Abubakar Sani Bello-led Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has denied knowledge of the resumption of the Secretary, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe. Spokesman of the CECPC, Ismae’el Ahmed, a lawyer, spoke with reporters after the meeting of the committee at the party headquarters in Abuja. The Secretary, who was at the office in the morning, was absent at the caretaker committee meeting, which was chaired by former Senate President, Senator Ken Nnamani. On why Akpanudoedehe was not part of the meeting, Ahmed simply said he thought the party scribe had travelled. “I don’t know his itinerary. He doesn’t tell me if he is coming to the secretariat or not. So, I am not aware that he was around. I even thought he travelled,” he said.

Asked if the party has resolved issues with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) over the NEC meeting, Ahmed quipped: “Our NEC meeting will hold on Thursday as scheduled.” He also elaborated on the cost of the Convention nomination and expression of interest forms, noting a typographical error in the earlier document released by the party. He stated that the chairmanship nomination form goes for N20 million, while the National Secretary and Deputy National Chairman (North and South) are pegged at N10 million. Forms for all other National Working Committee (NWC) members go for N5 million, while forms for non-NWC NEC positions go for N1 million. Other zonal positions cost N500,000 as earlier announced.
