The Methodist Boys High School Old Boys Association has urged the Methodist Church of Nigeria to stop encroaching on the school land. Speaking at the school’s Founder’s Day celebration in Lagos, President of the association, Mr. Kolapo Sogbetun said: “The only thing we are asking the Church to do is to withdraw from the site and stop plundering school assets. We make bold to state that the school founded in 1878 is duly registered under the Lagos State Ministry of Education. Thus, the church can neither tamper nor plunder, nor sell any of its asset strictly meant for education,” he said.

He admonished the church to jettison its plan of building luxury flats on the school premises for commercial purposes.
