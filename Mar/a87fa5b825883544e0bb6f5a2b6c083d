Heavily armed security operatives, including the Police, have barricaded the access road to the Cross River Assembly. Twenty lawmakers, including 18 Assembly members and two House of Representatives members were sacked on Monday by a Court over their defection from the People’s Democratic Party( PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC). The operatives stopped passersby from using the route and turned back Assembly workers reporting to work. Speaking on the situation, Cross River police spokesperson, SP Irene Ugbo, said the barricade was to secure government property in adherence to the Federal High Court ruling. “It is a proactive measure because you can not tell if some unscrupulous persons may want to take laws into their hands,” she said.   2023: Saraki picks PDP presidential nomination form     Bamise: Lagos BRT driver remanded over alleged rape, murder     VIDEO: Traditionalists protest appointment of new OAU VC   A statement from the Special Adviser, Media and Publicity to the Governor, Mr. Christian Ita, informed APC members of the National Assembly from Cross River, members of the Cross River Assembly and the general public that an appeal against the judgement of the Federal High Court, Abuja has been filed at the Court of Appeal, Abuja.
