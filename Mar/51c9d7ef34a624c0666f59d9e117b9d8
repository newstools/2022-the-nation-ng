With different photo filter apps popping up daily, actress Mercy Johnson-Okojie has argued their effects cannot be compared to reality. Photo filter apps over the years have gained popularity among celebrities and non-celebrities. Photo filter is a software routine that changes the appearance of an image or part of an image by altering the shades and colors of the pixels in some manner. Filters are used to increase brightness and contrast as well as to add a wide variety of textures, tones and special effects to a picture.
