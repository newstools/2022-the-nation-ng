A cleric, Rev Canon LumenCristi Eboh, has resigned as an ordained priest of the Anglican Communion in Anambra State. Eboh, a radio and televangelist, cited alleged harassment, high-handedness, intimidation and conspiratorial manipulations by his Diocesan, Bishop Owen Nwokolo, as reasons for his resignation. In a statement yesterday, Eboh, who presides over a congregation and prayer ministry called God in Action Adoration Ministry, said his involvement in charismatic activities contributed to his conflict with the prelate. He accused Nwokolo of insisting that his ministry’s registered trustees be altered to include him (Nwokolo) and wife, noting that he resisted the conditions on the basis that God did not reveal the bishop or his wife to him as vessels in the ministry.

According to him, the diocesan authorities engaged agents to defame his character, including spreading rumours of sexual misconduct and voodoo against him. He said: “My refusal to include the bishop as a trustee and hand over landed property of the Adoration Ministry brought about the conflict between the bishop and I. “The troubles instigated by the diocesan authorities soon began to affect my private life, as my wife has been bought over by forces working within the diocese to become instruments of subversion and opposition against me.” Bishop Nwokolo dismissed the allegations, describing them as false and baseless. Nwokolo, speaking through the Legal Officer of the diocese, Humphrey Udechukwu, said the priest also violated church’s principles amid support from the bishop.
