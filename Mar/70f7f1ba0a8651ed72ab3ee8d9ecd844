The Federal Government, in collaboration with the European Union, has intensified campaign for product specification to increase exportation of unique products in the country. The Minister, Industry, Trade and Investment, Adeniyi Adebayo, applauded the European Union and European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) for funding the Intellectual Property Rights and Innovation in Africa (AfriPi project). Adebayo noted that the AfriPI Project has gone a long way in supporting African companies, creators and inventors by generating value from their intellectual property.

Adebayo said: “The benefits obtainable from geographical indications in Nigeria are immense. Nigeria is one of the most culturally diverse societies in the world. We can boast of a wide variety of products that can be classified as GI. These range from the popular Ijebu garri to Nsukka Yellow Pepper, the Sokoto Red Skin Goat and the famous Yauri Onions. Unfortunately, poor knowledge of geographical Indications and the absence of a specific legal framework has rendered our unique products more vulnerable to misappropriation”. “Nigeria has a strategic ambition to position itself as a major supply chain partner to key off-taker nations. Geographical indications will play a major role in helping Nigerian producers generate greater value for their products.”
