Udinese forward Success Isaac not given up hope of playing for the Super Eagles again despite not earning a call-up in over four years. After a successful time with the Golden Eaglets and the Flying Eagles, Success made his Super Eagles debut in 2017, aged just 21 years and two months, under German gaffer Gernot Rohr. But the 26-year-old picked up the last of his four international caps in November 2018, appearing for 45 minutes of Nigeria’s 0-0 friendly draw against Uganda. Injuries have not helped his cause, though, with the Udinese number seven just starting three league matches over the last three seasons before his switch to Italy in the summer. Success’ Super Eagles chances have even dwindled the more with the emergence of more consistent attacking talents, including Napoli’s Victor Osimhen, Almeria’s Umar Sadiq, Union Berlin’s Taiwo Awoniyi, and Villarreal’s Samuel Chukwueze, among others.

Most of them have been included in the 32-man squad preparing to face Ghana in the final FIFA World Cup playoff later this month. Success is aware that with the abundance of Nigerian talents at home and abroad, his path back to the national team could be challenging. But the ex-Watford attacker is confident he will be willing to give his best whenever he gets the chance.  “Nigeria has a lot of players who are young and are doing well at their clubs,” Success told Estadio Deportivo. “It’s a bit difficult, now I’m focused with my team here, although if I have the opportunity to go with the national team, I will always be ready for it.” Success was a member of the Golden Eaglets squad that lifted the 2013 FIFA U-17 World Cup, beating Mexico in the final.
