Matawalle said this in a statement by Mr Zailani Bappa, his Special Adviser on Public Enlightenment, Media and Communications on Friday in Gusau. “It is not right for us to wash our dirty linens in the media, especially at this critical time of the party’s transformation as we move towards a decisive period in 2023. “I believe that each of us has been trying his best in his way to move the interest of our great party forward. “His Excellency, Gov. Mai Mala Buni has no doubt, contributed immensely to the promotion of the party’s fortunes and indeed all other governors who disagreed with one another. “However, we all disagree to agree. That is the beauty of democracy. There is no point in promoting disharmony among ourselves after disagreements are settled,” he said.
