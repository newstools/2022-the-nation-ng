Paris Saint-Germain forward Kylian Mbappe has been named in the squad for the Champions League last 16 second leg clash with Real Madrid tonight despite nursing a sore left foot. The 23-year-old World Cup winner was kicked in the foot in training on Monday but had a “reassuring” medical check-up. Mbappe would be a huge loss were he not to play as he scored the only goal in the 1-0 victory over 13-time European champions Real in the first leg in Paris last month.
