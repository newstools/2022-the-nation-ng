Nigeria’s US-based middleweight boxer, Gifted Cole will today aim to continue his unbeaten streak when he steps out in a 10-round bout against Mexican Jaudiel Zepeda. Cole, the titleholder of WBF junior middleweight champion, Global Boxing Federation super middleweight, and Universal Boxing Federation (UBF) International Super Middleweight crowns, is determined to show class against the Mexican. The Nigerian said he trained hard and was also ready for the faceoff against his opponent. “I’m aware he is a very good boxer and a good test for me as well.

It would be recalled that Cole’s opponent, Miguel Lopez, who is also a Mexican failed to show up in his last fight. The Ajegunle-born boxer like many Nigerians was not impressed by the lack of representation of the country’s pugilists at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics which prompted his decision to hold a 1-day boxing clinic at Festac, Lagos, and in Lekki last year for the sole purpose of helping to discover boxers who would represent Nigeria in the nearest future at the biggest stage.
