The Russian Football Union (RFU) has failed in a bid to stay the suspension of its national team from World Cup qualifying, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) said on Friday. The RFU had wanted a decision from the ruling body FIFA frozen until a full decision from CAS on its appeal against a FIFA suspension in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The CAS said: “The challenged decision remains in force and all Russian teams and clubs continue to be suspended from participation in FIFA competitions.” Russia were originally due to host Poland in a play-off match next Thursday. The winners are to advance into a deciding game for a place at the World Cup against Sweden or the Czech Republic on March 29.   Russia-Ukraine crisis: Is Putin a soulless tyrant?

Poland, Sweden and the Czechs said before the suspension they would refuse to play against Russia. The CAS had earlier in the week also rejected a Russian appeal to stay a suspension of its national teams and clubs by the European body UEFA. Germany’s RB Leipzig got a walk-over in the Europa League last 16 against Spartak Moscow. Arbitration proceedings will now continue, but a date for a hearing is yet to be set while the CAS said that written submissions are being exchanged by the involved parties.
