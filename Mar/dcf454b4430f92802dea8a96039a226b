Coach Luciano Spalletti has hailed Victor Osimhen for salvaging the needed 2-1 away victory for Napoli against Verona while describing the Nigerian as a top footballer that would rule the world in a few months. After a disappointing 1-0 loss to AC Milan last week, Spalletti believes the win has revived the title hope of Napoli.

He was devastating for goals, sometimes he confuses certain goals because Verona is plagued, sometimes he has already cleaned a ball, and instead he goes with creative interpretations. Even when he decides to bet five or six defenders. He is a top footballer who will become super top in the coming months,” the coach said. Speaking during a post-match press conference after the victory over Verona, Spalletti added: “We did everything we had to do, it’s normal that the opponents are there too. We considered everything that was going on, Verona made people talk about themselves because they have the strength, creativity, and technique. But today we have to congratulate my boys, they put something more than the normal characteristics into it. I expect that we always have this reaction they had today. ”
