It’s National President Dr Yetunde Akinluyi and General Secretary, Revd Kolawole Verralls, said: “The idea of sitting on the fence or criticising political leaders of bad governance should be discouraged, rather obtaining Permanent Voter’s Card (PVC) which will enable us to elect credible leaders.   30 schools for sports fiesta     Ansaru-ud-Deen holds induction for branch officers     Graft: Group urges council leader to clear his name   “We have watched with dismay how Nigerians, especially our youths stay aloof but criticise every move of the government especially on social media platforms. We want them to show interest in the politics. The best way to get involved is for them to get their PVCs. “We have realised that most of the on-line political commentators and agitators do not possess PVC, yet their voices are the loudest when issues of governance are raised. How can you change bad leadership when you don’t have the weapon to do so which is your PVC. Nigeria can only be great if committed Christians, people with the fear of God and high credibility are elected to lead us.”
