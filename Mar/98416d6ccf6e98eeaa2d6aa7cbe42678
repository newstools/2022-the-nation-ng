Veteran actor Kanayo O. Kanayo has cursed those behind the spread of his death rumour. The visibly appalled thespian, in a video, shared on his Instagram page revealed he woke up to see posters announcing his death on social media. The baffled KOK, who said he was tagged in a poster that had about five of his photos with ‘RIP’, cursed the masterminds. He said behind they won’t live beyond the next seven days. The 60-year-old media personality said: “I don’t know what people gain by carrying out rumours, printing their own obituaries. I don’t know why somebody will just wake up in the morning and start tagging somebody. “Most people think that Nollywood actors or entertainers or popular people don’t have families. I mean, what kind of life do they think we live?   1999 Constitution needs amendment, says Dj Big N     Ladies who pose with backsides classless – Ugezu     2022 AMVCA: Larry Gaaga, others battle for N1m prize, Best…   “Somebody wakes up, compiles three, four, five pictures and puts ‘RIP’. You will not live past the next seven days. You’ve got the wrong guy. Thanking friends who have called to check up on him, KOK confirmed he’s hale and hearty while he reiterated the curse laid on the culprit. He added: “My life has never been in anybody’s hand. I want to thank all my friends who have called since morning. I’m hale and hearty. I don’t even have a fever. Thank you for calling. “And whoever has compiled these pictures, published his own obituary, seven days; you’ll exit this world. Thanks for your kindness.” The video’s caption read: “You think because you have access to the social media, you can publish ANYTHING. Adieu to you.”
