Former presidential aide Dr. Doyin Okupe has given hope to actress Kemi Afolabi over her incurable ailment, Lupus. Okupe, in an open letter, expressed that while Lupus is incurable, it is untrue that the actress has limited years to live. “My dear Kemi, I read about your affliction with Lupus with much compassion. I was, however, saddened by your announcement that doctors told you that you have about five years to live. This is untrue. It is a lie of the devil,” the co-founder of Royal Cross Medical Centre noted. Okupe also noted that though the ailment is incurable, there are cases of complete remissions. “True Lupus is incurable but there are recorded cases of inexplicable complete remissions,” he said.
