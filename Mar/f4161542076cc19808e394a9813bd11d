Some of these talents really do not have much access to funding and networks and we want to provide opportunities for them to keep improving. It is with the hope that the creative industry will one day soon, grow as big as the Fintech’s who are presently dominating the digital space with incredible innovations.  It is indeed a new world and every young African talent deserves to play their role and contribute to the development of the continent.” Atta said. “The future of film in Africa is changing at a fast and positive pace and we are glad to be part of the conversation. Festivals like the Film Rats Club organised by young talents form part of the changing narrative.’ Atta concluded.
