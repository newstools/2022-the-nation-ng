The Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA) has once again called for an incisive policy implementation in the energy sector, saying that this will limit the economy’s exposure to global shocks and serve as a springboard for sustained economic growth. The Chamber in a statement signed by its National President, Ide  Udeagbala, yesterday, said it was concerned about rising prices of petroleum products, particularly diesel and aviation fuel. The association said the hike  has had an effect of the on-going conflict in Europe, which has been made worse by a lack of domestic production to meet demand despite the existence of refineries.

NACCIMA said it does not expect the shutdown of flights over the scarcity of aviation fuel and the issues of the national grid to bring the economy to a standstill in the short or medium term. NACCIMA added: “We expect rising inflation, a further erosion of the purchasing power of the population, and redistribution of wealth that plunges more of the population below the poverty line.” The Chamber said this is the likely result of the private sector seeking to adapt and adjust to the new realities.
