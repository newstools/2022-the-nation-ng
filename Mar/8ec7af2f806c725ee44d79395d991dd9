Movie director and producer, Abiodun Olanrewaju, popularly known as Abbey Lanre, has advised fans not to be fascinated by luxury lifestyle on social media, saying it does not translate to reality. Olanrewaju gave the advice in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Tuesday in Lagos. “People now flaunt what they don’t have on social media; success is relative; their posts don’t translate into money in their accounts. “I want to belong; we need to be careful. As I am here in this hotel, I can take a picture in one corner and tell you this is my house. “If you believe it at first, the day you will come to the same hotel, if you are observant, you will notice it, what does that make me,” he said.

It’s not just acting, it cuts across all professions, but ours is more pronounced because of our job. “It’s not just in acting, it is everywhere. As actors, we are teachers of wisdom, we should be able to teach people, but at the end of the day we are humans too. “You have to be passionate about what you want to do, fame will come eventually, but trust me, you will not want to be remembered for that,” he said.(NAN)
