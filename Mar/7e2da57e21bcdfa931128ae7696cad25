Los Verdiblancos are performing a balancing act between La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the UEFA Europa League, but manager Manuel Pellegrini is enjoying that particular challenge. “The only way to face three competitions is to think that the game that’s coming next is the most important,” said the Chilean tactician. “It’s important to retain our place in La Liga and perform in the other competitions too. That’s positive pressure, the pressure of a big team. The most important game is the next one. No competition is more important than the other.” Tomorrow , West Ham United travel to face Sevilla at 6:45pm on SuperSport Premier League while the late games are headlined by Barcelona tackling Galatasaray in a meeting of two of Europe’s biggest names at 9pm on SuperSport La Liga.
