Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Abdulrasheed Bawa, has said there is nothing political about the arrest of immediate past governor of Anambra State, Chief Willie Obiano. He said the anti-graft agency was only carrying out its mandate, which involves investigation of financial crimes. Bawa said this while addressing reporters at the fifth annual general assembly of the Network of National Anti-Corruption Institutions in West Africa (NACIWA) yesterday in Abuja. But he did not say when the former governor would be charged to court. He said the EFCC had granted bail to the former governor, though he did not give details of the bail conditions.

We are a penal institution. You know what the EFCC stands for. We investigate crimes. We look at people who have committed the crimes, we link it up together and, of course, we go to court. That is what we have been doing. That is all we will continue to do… “He (referring to Obiano) has been granted bail. We are waiting for him to fulfil his bail conditions. He has been cooperating with us and everything is going on well,” Bawa said. It was learnt that Obiano was taken into custody hours after he attended the inauguration of Governor Chukuwuma Soludo last Thursday. The former governor, who ended his tenure last Wednesday, was arrested at Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos. Subsequently, he was transferred from the EFCC custody in Lagos to Abuja. In September 2021, the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Anambra State asked the anti-graft agency to probe the finances of the state in order to unearth “monumental deception”.
