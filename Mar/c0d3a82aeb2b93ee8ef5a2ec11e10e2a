The founder of One Love Family, Satguru Maharaj Ji, has dissociated himself from Chief Rahman Adedoyin, owner of Hilton hotel and Oduduwa University, facing charges over the alleged murder of Mr Timothy Adegoke, a Master student of Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) Ile-Ife. He noted it was wrong for anyone to link him with the murderer of the innocent Nigerian, describing such allegations as political. Speaking in Ibadan during a briefing to clear the air on the allegations, Maharaj ji said the only time he met Adedoyin was when the latter celebrated his 60th birthday, which he attended on the strict invitation. Adedoyin, a hotelier was arrested, with five of his staff last year over the alleged murder of Adegoke, who lodged at his hotel. Maharaj Ji said he honoured the invitation for Adedoyin’s 60th birthday to pacify him as one of the contestants to the stool of Ooni of Ile-Ife a few years ago.

I went there and left, that was the only time I met him. So, linking me with ritual killing is political. “I am a prince of Ibadan land. We do not do such things here. Anyone interested should come and investigate. My doors are open,” he stated.
