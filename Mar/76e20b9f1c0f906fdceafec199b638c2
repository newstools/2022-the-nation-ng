It lamented that the previous government was not in charge of its activities, thereby believing everything from political appointees. The National President of the group, Lawrence Onuzulike, said in a statement that one of the past administration’s deceptions was payment of teachers’ pensions and gratuities. He hailed Soludo for visiting some schools where he ascertained that teachers’ gratuities and 2021 leave allowances were being owed, enjoining him to address the situation.

You won’t know where to start if you don’t go out to ascertain the challenges. “This was exactly what the governor did by visiting Okpoko Correctional Centre and other places, to observe the level of decay in those places. “We are impressed by his body language and statements of how he will run the affairs of the state. We’re particularly pleased with the choice of his transition team, a choice that made it clear he wants transparency. “He should not to lose focus, but be in charge of his administration. He should not sit in the office, believing in only what people tell him.” Pledging support for the government, Onuzulike advised the people, especially aggrieved politicians from other parties, to support Soludo to move the state forward.
