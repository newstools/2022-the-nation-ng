A member of Imo State House of Assembly representing Ohaji-Egbema, Okoro Cyriacus Heclus, has denied involvement in killings in his constituency. Last month, more than 10 people were killed in the community when gunmen identified by police as dreaded cultists were operating in the area. In a statement, the lawmaker said the killings were traceable to an intractable land dispute between two families in the community.

It’s a failed plan, baseless and unmarketable blackmail,” he said. On the insinuation that certain persons were imposed on the community leadership, Heclus said the matter was being investigated by the police.
