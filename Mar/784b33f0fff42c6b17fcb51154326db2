Sokoto Governor Aminu Tambuwal has denied reports attributed to him that a certain region cannot win the presidency if the People’s Democratic Party(PDP) picks its presidential candidate from there. A statement by his Special Adviser Media and Publicity, Muhammad Bello claimed the reports were untrue and misleading. It reads: “The attention of Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal has been drawn to a mischievious headline and story by a newspaper, that said a certain region of the country cannot win the Presidency.   UPDATED: Court ruling on Electoral Act divides Senators     MultiChoice increases prices of DStv, Gotv packages     Buhari inaugurates $2.5b ‘world’s second-largest…   “Both the headline and what follows are a distortion, misrepresentation and mis-presentation of the facts as was stated by him. “There were no innuendo or ‘veiled’ reference by Gov. Tambuwal to any statement made or credited to the South-south Governors during his reunion meeting with former states and federal legislators at the Fraiser Suites in Abuja today. “He didn’t say the PDP or his colleagues, the South-south Governors or any aspirant from the region cannot win PDP Presidency. “The report is simply a malicious and should be disregarded as fallacious, divisive and outright blackmail.”
