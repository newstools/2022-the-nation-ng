The Coalition of South East Youth Leaders (COSEYL) has urged the Department of State Services (DSS) to treat the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) Nnamdi Kanu fairly, following allegations that he was being tortured in custody. IPOB made the torture claims in a statement last week by its Media/Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful. Reacting, COSEYL in a statement by its President-General Goodluck Ibem urged the DSS to respect Kanu’s human rights.

Subjecting him to any form of inhuman treatment is against any known law both Nigerian and international.” It said holding Nnamdi Kanu in prison custody does not in any way add economic benefit to the country.
