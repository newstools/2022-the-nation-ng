The Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), yesterday failed to attend the hearing of a suit challenging the legality of his unilateral amendment of the Rules of Professional Conduct for Legal Practitioners (RPC), 2007. The Incorporated Trustees of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) had sued Malami at the Federal High Court in Abuja, querying, among others, his powers to amend the RPC and some of the amendments effected. It is the NBA’s contention that the power to amend the RPC lies with the General Council of the Bar and not the AGF, who is just a member. At the mention of the case yesterday, the AGF, listed as the sole defendant, was absent; he was also not represented by any lawyer. Lawyer to the plaintiff, Sunday Ameh (SAN), expressed disappointment that the AGF was absent and was not also represented, despite being served with hearing notice.

He said since the case was coming up for the first time, the court should reschedule hearing for a later date to enable the AGF, or his lawyer, appear to participate in the hearing of the case. Ruling, Justice Donatus Okorowo said there was evidence that the AGF was duly served with the hearing notice and originating processes in the case. Justice Okorowo averred that the AGF had taken steps in the case by filing memorandum of appearance and counter-affidavit. The judge adjourned till May 12 for hearing. NBA President Olumide Akpata led some other lawyers to court to witness yesterday’s proceedings.
