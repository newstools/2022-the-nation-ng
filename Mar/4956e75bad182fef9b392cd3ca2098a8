He needs to improve when he is at the limit of area, in the first shot, in the speed of execution … If he improves in this type of situation, he becomes one of the best,” he said. Meanwhile, Osimhen’s teammate Matteo Politano admitted that Napoli made a lot of mistakes during their 1-0 home defeat to AC Milan. Politano told Rai Sport after the tie that they would continue to fight for the Scudetto. “I believe in Scudetto race, the team believes in it and I hope the public will do the same. We have difficult games, the next we have a difficult one in Verona, we have to think about ourselves and score as many points as possible. Milan are a strong opponent, they always come up front with the midfielders and the defenders; we went into some difficulty.”
