An Osun State High Court, Osogbo presided over by Justice Oyebola Ojo has ruled that Hilton Hotel owner, Dr. Rahmon Adedoyin, and six staff members have a case to answer over the death of one Timothy Adegoke, a student of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife. The defendants’ counsel Yusuf Alli, SAN, told the court at the last sitting that the defendants did not have a case to answer because the prosecution failed to establish any case against them. Prosecution counsel M. O. Omosun opposed the claim. At yesterday’s sitting, Justice Ojo said a prima facie case was established against all the defendants.
