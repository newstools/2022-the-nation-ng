The President, Anambra State Association of Town Union (ASATU), Women Wing, Franca Nwigbo, has canvassed for laws to make the process of getting married affordable, to restore the sanctity of marriage. Nwigbo’s advice followed outcry by youths over exorbitant cost of marriage rites. The Coordinator, National Youth Council (NYC), Awka South, Mr. Stanley Nkala, had during a forum organised by the Justice Development and Peace Caritas (JDPC) and the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), attributed the growing number of single mothers in the state to outrageous cost of marriage rites.

The Manager, JDPC Onitsha/FCDO project, Mr. Alphonsus Nwoye, said there was need to review the high demands in marriage rites in the state, to enable young men and women get married. “We will make our recommendations and plan a visit to the state government and traditional rulers in the communities, so that these issues will be considered,” he said
