The Secretary of All Progressives Congress (APC) in Lagos State, Lanre Odesanya, said students should take active interest in politics. He said participation, mobilisation and sensitisation constituted the engine room of consolidated democracy. Odesanya, lawyer and former member of House of Assembly, said youths should hold the ace in political participation because in their 18-35 age bracket, they account for 70 million of the 200 million population. He lamented that the youths have shunned politics by refusing to register to vote.

He said: “There is power in number, and strength in figures only if adequately utilised. If the Nigerian students must make concrete change to our electoral cartography, then, they must be ready to participate, mobilise and sensitise.” Urging students to participate, even as spectators at first, Odesanya said: “One thing about starting from bottom and rising gradually to the top is that you will learn how to swim the murky water of politics, you will learn leadership traits from your mentors and you will contribute to your community and country early enough.” He said vibrant youths bubbling with ideas and energies and should join politics and canvass for popular candidates in their constituencies. Odesanya said: “Brand yourself, sell your ideas, look for mentors, be known in your community for positive acts and do not forget to join a political party. If you don’t mind, APC is there for you to launch your political career.”
