A businessman, Mustapha Baba, on Wednesday prayed a Sharia Court in Kaduna State, to order his estranged wife, Amina Sani, to return a diamond necklace he gave her as a condition to oblige her request for divorce. Baba, who resides in Kaduna metropolis, through his counsel, Ahmad Ibrahim told the court that his client had many requests. Earlier, Sani, said she was seeking a divorce in order not to disobey God by not submitting to her husband.

Later appearing as counsel to the complainant, MK Mustapha, prayed the court to adjourn the case to avail him the opportunity to investigate the matter and for possible out-of-court settlement between the parties. The Judge, Malam Murtala Nasir, after listening to the parties said the Islamic law for terminating a marriage if requested by the wife is to pay back the amount of money paid as bride price. Nasir adjourned the case to March 22. (NAN)
