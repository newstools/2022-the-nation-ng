I do not want to pre-empt but the GFA will meet the sports media in Kumasi, go on the radio and speak to the people to calm nerves,” he told Precise FM. “Some people do not know how psychologically utterances affect situations. The hatred for the Black Stars are born out of a lot of issues, sometimes not because of the team itself but hatred for some people who surround the team but I entreat all to erase that hatred for the betterment of the team,” he added. The Black Stars will open camp on Tuesday at the Baba Yara Stadium as they seek to return to the Mundial for the fourth time.
