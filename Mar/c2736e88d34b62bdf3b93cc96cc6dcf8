He said: “We shut down all business activities this morning to ensure that government  listens to us on the demand reached with the former Exco  sometime in 2014. ‘’We have not jettisoned the agreement with the management, but we are not talking about getting financial autonomy, no this grey area that we are now talking about is a particular allowance approved to us since 2014. “Our predecessor left this pending issue and handed it over to us and we now took it to see that whatever belongs to our union should be given to us, it was only the overhead cost that the government was able to pay,” he said.
