Speaking on major challenges he faces as a movie producer, he said “I face so many challenges. A lot of people text you to ask for roles and if they’re not in the cast, they feel bad. Meanwhile, you can’t cast everybody in your production. You just have to pick the right people and if they fit in the role, cool. Financial challenge is another problem and also pressure can be listed as a challenge.”
