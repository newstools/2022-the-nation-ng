A rights group, Centre for Social and Economic Rights, yesterday urged the leader of Agbado Oke-Odo Council in Lagos State to clear his name from corruption allegations against him. The group said Ogunyemi Emmanuel, who has been alleged to be in breach of Section 22 of the ICPC Act for concurrently drawing salaries from the Lagos State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) and Agbado Oke Council should clear his name. An organization, LYGEL Youths and leadership Initiatives, had in a petition dated August 11, 2021 to the independent Corrupt Practices Commission (ICPC) levelled the allegation. Ogunyemi denied the allegation, saying that he never violated any law.

The coordinator of the Centre, Nelson Ekujumi, told reporters in Lagos that the council leader has been granted administrative bail. He lauded members of the Agbado Oke-Odo Local Council Development Area (LCDA) legislature for asking the leader of the House to step aside from office, pending the resolution allegations against him. Ekujumi urged party leaders not to cover up, but ensure that truth is upheld and justice is not delayed.
