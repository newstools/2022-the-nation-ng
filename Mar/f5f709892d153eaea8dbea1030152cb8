Four goals in 22 second-half minutes helped Chelsea cruise to victory in their first Premier League game since owner Roman Abramovich said he will sell the club. Manager Thomas Tuchel admitted news of the Russian billionaire’s decision had been a distraction, but his side did not show it at Turf Moor thanks to two goals from Kai Havertz, sandwiched between Reece James’ opener and Christian Pulisic’s close-range finish. Burnley will rue missed opportunities when the scores were level as they fell to a second successive defeat to remain in the relegation zone.

First, Pulisic’s pinpoint cross was guided home expertly by Havertz, before the German bundled James’ cross over the line. Pulisic got in on the act 21 minutes from time, rounding off what turned out to be a comfortable afternoon for Chelsea. BBC
