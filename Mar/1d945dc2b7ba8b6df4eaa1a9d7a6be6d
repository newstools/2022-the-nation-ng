TUNISIA were gifted a 1-0 win in the first leg of their 2022 World Cup play-off by hosts Mali. The unfortunate Moussa Sissako scored the only goal of the game as he put the ball into his own net in the 36th minute. Things got worse for Sissako just four minutes later when he was shown a straight red card for a foul on the edge of the area. Despite playing the whole of the second half with 10 men Mali created the better chances but could not find their way past a stubborn Tunisian defence.

It took the Eagles more than twenty minutes to find their pace and start causing the Carthage Eagles any real threat. Their rhythm was shattered when Sissako, who plays in Belgium for Standard Liege, under no pressure at all received the ball on the edge of the area and managed to make his back pass too strong and too wide of Ibrahim Mounkoro.. To add insult to injury, Sissako was sent off minutes later when he raced after Saifeddine Jaziri and clumsily clipped him from behind with the referee deciding a goal-scoring opportunity had been denied.
