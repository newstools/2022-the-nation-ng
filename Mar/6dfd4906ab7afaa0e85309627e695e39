Minister of State Petroleum Resources Chief Timipre Sylva has attributed the inability of Nigeria to meet the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to a lack of investments in the oil and gas sector of the economy. Nigeria’s OPEC quota is pegged at 1.8 million bpd but in the last few years, the country has struggled between 1.3 and 1.4 million bpd. Speaking at a ministerial plenary, at the ongoing Ceraweek, in Houston, Texas Sylva said the speed with which international oil companies and other investors were withdrawing investments in hydrocarbon exploitation has contributed significantly to Nigeria’s inability to meet OPEC target.
