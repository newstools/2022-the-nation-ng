The rapper, while speaking with Jahbless during a recent live podcast, said he feels great when performing new freestyles at shows even though he has a couple of hits.

I wrote a song on my way to the concert. I think it was about 16 or 24 bars and when I got on stage I spit that 24 bars that I wrote, trust me I felt better spitting a raw fresh bar than performing my hit songs because even if I had performed my hit song, it wouldn’t have gotten that standing ovation, so that’s the way I see music.” Continuing, he said, “I might be going to an event right now, I don’t necessarily have to perform my hit song, I can write probably 16 bars and people will still enjoy it even more than my hit song.” Relieving his experience performing with Fuji musician, Saheed Osupa, the lagos born musician said “Osupa once came to perform in my home town somewhere very close to Epe not knowing I’m from that village, when I saw him and greeted him, he gave me the mic to freestyle and the love was massive to the extent that my aunty was shocked that I am that popular.”
