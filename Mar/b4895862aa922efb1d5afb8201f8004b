According to him: “The 31 arrived from Romania and they are all students and Nigerians based in Ukraine. They came on the commercial flights because their number was not that much. “We have 31 of them. Actually, 35 should have arrived but about four of them could not make it to the airport. But they will join the next batch. “What we actually doing is to make sure that the number is sizeable so that they come by chartered flight but if their number is not sizeable to warrant them take a chartered flight then they come by commercial.”
