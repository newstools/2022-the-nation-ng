Popular singer Timaya has been picked up by police operatives at his residence in Lekki, Lagos for allegedly hitting a lady with his car. He was arrested a few hours after a lady on Instagram Osinubi Omowumi(Whyte_26) accused the singer of hitting her sister in the early hours of Thursday. A post on her Instagram story reads: “These celebrities and how they behave @Timaya almost killed my sister this morning. “She hit her car with his car and ran. At Ikate a few hours ago, he hit my sister’s car and came down and came down to ask him to look what he did.” She added: “This heartless human being was asking for a number and she told him he will block her rather for Timaya to do the needful, he hit my sister and ran away.
