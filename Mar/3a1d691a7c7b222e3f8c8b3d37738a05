The creation of the agent banking system by the Central Bank of Nigeria CBN), roll-out and deployment of the Point of Sale (PoS) terminals by banks are expanding financial inclusion, Wema Bank officials have said. The two senior officers are Damola Bolodeoku, Head, E-Business, and Adekunle Alarapon, Head Retail Segments. Both spoke on an NTA Network programme, “Weekend Deal”, which x-rayed the benefits and challenges of PoS since its inception. Bolodeoku said the PoS business has witnessed 86 per cent growth in the last two years and has helped to bring a large segment of the informal and unbanked population into the formal financial system. According to him, financial service delivery has become easier, especially in the rural areas where there are no banks, through the massive deployment of PoS terminals.

Alarapon said the CBN is pushing financial inclusion through agent banking to integrate about N2.6 trillion in the informal and unbanked sector. According to him, CBN’s target has been to achieve about 25 per cent financial inclusion of the adult  population within a short time. Alarapon refuted claims that banks were pushing customers to their PoS. terminals to earn a commission ”It is not true. The CBN is only trying to bring most Nigerians into the financial system through the PoS. Wema Bank, for instance, charges low. For withdrawals from N1000 to N5000, we charge N30. For withdrawals from N5100 to N10,000, we charge N50, and so on. And we still pay the switch company,” Alarapon explained.
