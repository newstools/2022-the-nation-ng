Three have suspended their £120MILLION shirt sponsorship contract with Chelsea following the Government’s crackdown on Roman Abramovich. The telecommunications provider became the west Londoners’ main shirt sponsors ahead of the 2020-21 season in a three-year deal. But they’ve decided to halt their deal with the Blues following the UK Government’s decision to freeze Abramovich’s assets. The sanctions come due to the oligarch’s relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin – who began an illegal invasion of Ukraine a fortnight ago. A statement read: “In light of the Government’s recently-announced sanctions, we have requested Chelsea Football Club temporarily suspend our sponsorship of the club including the removal our brand from the and around the stadium until further notice.

The Government’s decision to sanction Abramovich, 55, has had serious ramifications for the club – which he was hoping to offload for £3BILLION to prevent having it seized.
