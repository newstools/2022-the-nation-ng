THE inclusion of Odion Ighalo in Nigeria’s provisional World Cup squad for the play-off round against Ghana has attracted disapproval from a number of fans. The Al-Hilal forward is in the 30-man squad named by coach Augustine Eguavoen that will face the Black Stars on March 25 in Cape Coast before the return leg, which is slated for March 29 at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium in Abuja. One fan expressed his outright disapproval of Ighalo’s inclusion. “Of what use is Ighalo,” writes @SkeiRipper.   ‘We have taken steps to reposition Lobi Stars’     Troost-Ekong ruled out of clash against Ghana     WC playoff: Ndidi predicts tough Ghana game   Others were shocked to see Ighalo in while Taiwo Awoniyi did not make the cut, particularly after he showed glimpses of what he can do during the last Africa cup of Nations. “This forced attempt to have Ighalo in the team and drop Taiwo Awoniyi is distasteful.” AdewoleSite. This list is somehow. Why will Dennis, Lookman and Ighalo make the list while Awoniyi is dropped. Awoniyi is the first name I expect on that list because of his performance back at AFCON,” writes Olayanju. “I expect Musa, Ighalo, Onazi should have played their testimonial matches by now,” another writes.
