The Nigerian team has touched down in Kumasi ahead of the first leg of their crucial Qatar 2022 World Cup qualifier against the Black Stars of Ghana. However, the welcome at the Kumasi international airport was distasteful, as the Super Eagles players and officials had to employ different techniques to jump down from the plane as the ramp that was provided was too short for the aircraft. While the Ghanaian airport authorities have apologised, stating that they were not prepared for the size of the aircraft that was conveying the Nigerian contingent, the treatment could be considered as antics to put the Super Eagles off ahead of the clash. The Ghanaians already started pulling some strings when they refused to release their squad list for the doubleheader. And the experience at the airport could, many fans think is one of their tricks to destabilise the Super Eagles.

Nonetheless, some Ghanaians were happy with the situation, as they felt that it would help unsettle the Nigerian team. A fan James Nalton wrote: “Some interesting different approaches to this far from the easy exit for the Nigeria players after landing in Ghana. The Sit and Drop probably the best.” Quipped another: “I’m even thinking of how they will climb that ramp when going back to Nigeria cause it’s easier to jump out of the plane than climbing back in. God, please help us abeg. A Ghanaian fan Nana wrote: “As a Ghanaian this is unacceptable. You get to know the type of aircraft they will be coming in with way ahead of time. We just failed and have to apologize to our Nigerian brothers.”
