Right now we are promoting a particular song on the EP which is entitled, ‘Soro.’” Continuing, the 17-year-old vocalist said, “You don’t really expect life to be a bed of roses but it’s been a ride and lots of experiences both positive and negative.

NaomiBillz, who began her music career professionally at the age of 14, disclosed that she grew up in a music family. “I think we got this gift in our family because a couple of my uncles including Kidifa, Spenderker, and StereoMan who are South Africa-based are doing music too. “Music has been part of me from a child. I started miming Psquare, Tubaba, and others’ songs. I remember when I was a little child, my dad asked me what I’m going to become when I grow up and I told him I was going to be a famous musician.”
