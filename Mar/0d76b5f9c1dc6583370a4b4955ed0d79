Starting with the poor relationship Neymar Sr. has with the club, the player’s constant injuries, his many problems out of the pitch. The list just goes on and he doesn’t return his monetary worth with results on the pitch. This is the fifth time PSG can’t win the UEFA Champions League with Neymar as their biggest star. Last Wednesday against Real Madrid, both he and Messi weren’t able to produce the impact they required and this situation has reached a point of no return. According to this report, the emir is already set on his decision to sell Neymar next summer with no exceptions. The Brazilian star’s arrival to PSG can be considered the biggest transfer blunder in the club’s history in terms of the prime objective they had by bringing him on board. Since he hasn’t delivered, the club’s owner is willing to cut him from the team and sell him to the highest bidder while they can still get some of the money spent back in 2017. Although €222 million are impossible to get, they can at least try to sell him for a little under €100 million.
