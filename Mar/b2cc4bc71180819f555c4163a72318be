A former commissioner for Education in Edo State, Prof Ngozi Osarenren, has called on the West African Examination Council(WAEC) not to appoint people without credibility as invigilators in its examinations. Osarenren warned that selecting people the examination body cannot vouch for would create problems for the examination process. She spoke at the 27th annual WAEC Endowment Fund lecture with the theme: “Assessing the assessors: Looking back and looking forward” in Abuja on Monday. According to her, supervisors and invigilators appointed by WAEC should be above board by not being compromised in the face of “juicy offers.” To avoid its supervisors and invigilators being compromised, Osarenren admonished WAEC to ensure proper remuneration for them.

He should not compromise in the face of juicy offers by principals and school administrators who are interested in having boasting rights of ‘our school is always making 100 per cent.’ How are they always making 100 per cent? “Once the teacher supervisor compromises that becomes a problem. We have to be extremely careful to ensure that we don’t run into such problems. “Don’t select and appoint people we cannot vouch for their credibility. It is going to create problems for the examination process.” She said stakeholders must ensure that nothing happens to WAEC. She called for improved welfare for supervisors and invigilators as this would help to enhance the sanctity of WAEC examinations. “The onus is on us as stakeholders to ensure that nothing happens to WAEC. Seventy years is huge, it has come and WAEC will continue to be there even though some of us may not be here,” she added.
