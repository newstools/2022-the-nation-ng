Foremost music show presenter and showbiz executive, Dayo ‘D1’ Adeneye, has said that his recognition by the Afrobeat Hall of Fame is well deserving. D1 made this known in a chat with The Nation after he was inducted into the Afrobeat Hall of Fame with his longtime friend and partner, Kenny Ogungbe. D1 further said it was only right to be recognised for their efforts in making the genre an international export. “We thank God that some people sat somewhere and recognized our small contributions to what is now Afrobeats through our radio, TV and our musical record label then.   K1 will continue to be celebrated for uncommon skills at 65     Ex-BBNaija housemates Teddy A, BamBam welcome second child     Tit bits from Davido’s UK concert at O2 arena   “So it feels good that we are recognized for our contribution and we will continue to do so. Those things that we learnt in America we decided to come back to Nigeria and implement and the result is what you are seeing today, now we are exporting them back,” Adeneye said. On his decision to join politics, the former Commissioner stressed that every Nigerian youth must contribute to native national growth by participating in politics. He said: “I’ve always told myself I won’t sit at home and join people who complain that Nigeria is bad, that is why I joined politics. That is what our youths need to do; they form 65% of the population. We have the old men in office because our youths are busy on social media. I did it because I wanted youth people to be inspired, that’s what we need more of. “It’s a lifelong thing that I am committed to, it took me a while to decide to go into it and like I said, it’s not about winning but to participate. If you don’t contribute you cannot have your voice heard.”
