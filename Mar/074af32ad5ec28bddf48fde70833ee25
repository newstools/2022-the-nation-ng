Mayorkun, who is signed under Davido’s record label, DMW in an interview with Chude Jideonwo, revealed he met Davido at the time he really needed intervention since he was having problems with his banking job.

The video caught Davido’s attention who reached out to him on Twitter, set up a meeting in his house and the rest was history.

When we got there, we stayed outside and was eventually taken inside,” Mayorkun began. “When we got inside, there were so many persons and we were like, ‘look at someone’s person’. It was like a club. People were just having fun. “We met Davido, we spoke and went straight to the studio. He asked me if I was gonna go to the club and I said, “Uh hun! It wasn’t club that brought me here.’ “So, we went to the studio and I recorded my first song, “Eleko”, that same night.”
