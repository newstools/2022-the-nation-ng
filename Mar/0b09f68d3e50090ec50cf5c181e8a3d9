Olympics long jump bronze medalist Ese Brume will aim to become only the third Nigerian athlete to win medals in all three global athletics championships including the Olympics. Brume, who will be competing in her first World indoor championships has won medals at the World outdoor championships (bronze in 2019) and the Olympics (bronze in Tokyo) and is now hoping to join Glory Alozie and the late Sunday Bada as athletes who have won medals at the world athletics championships indoors and out as well as the Olympics. Alozie won silver at the World Indoor championships in 1999 in Maebashi (60m hurdles) and at the outdoor version later that year in Seville Spain (100m hurdles) before going to win another silver medal at the Olympics and in the process became the first Nigerian to win medals in all three global sporting fiesta. Bada followed suit a few days later after helping the men’s 4x400m relay team to win gold at the Sydney Olympics in 2000 to add to the three World Indoor championships medals he won (1993,1995 and 1997) and a 4x400m relay bronze at the World outdoor championships in Gothenburg, Sweden in 1995.

The 25 year old will however hope to shake off rustiness as she has not competed indoors this year and the towering figure of home girl, Ivana Vuleta (nee Spanovic) who is the pre-championships undoubted favourite. The 31 year old Vuleta is not only coming to the championships as the defending champion but also the world leader in the event with the 6.88m she jumped at the World Indoor Tour Silver meeting in Belgrade last week. Vuleta also jumped 6.83m three times in that competition, a mark none of her rivals have hit this year. A medal for Brume will also make her the third Nigerian long jumper after Paul Emordi (silver in 1987) and Chioma Ajunwa (silver in 1997) to make the podium in the history of the championships.
