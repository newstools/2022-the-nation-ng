Ade Sun-Basorun, the Chief Executive Officer of FoodCo Nigeria, a leading omni-channel retailer with interests in supermarkets, quick service restaurants and manufacturing, has called on operators within Nigeria’s formal retail sector to integrate digitisation into their operations in order to achieve scale and position the sector for optimised service delivery. Sun-Basorun, who spoke during a recent meeting with senior Editors, harped on the importance of using digital technology to improve efficiency and reduce operational costs. He further stressed that digitisation was key to closing the deficit gap between the supply of modern retail and demand for the service among the country’s rapidly growing young, urban and sophisticated population. He said: “The global retail industry has been transformed by digitisation and it is expected to continue to evolve in the coming years ahead. For instance, Walmart, the biggest retailer in the world is significantly upscaling its brick and mortar operations to integrate digitisation and Amazon, the world’s most valuable retailer is already a digital native. Here in Nigeria, Jumia, the retailer with the highest Gross Merchandise Value (GMV), is also a wholly digital layer. So, we can see that digitisation has a critical role to play in the future of retail both in Nigeria and the wider globe.

A 2019 Omnisend Research showed that integrating technology into marketing campaigns led to a 90% customer retention rate and 250% higher engagement and purchase rates. While the organised retail sector has made progress in the area of leveraging technology to drive growth across digital sales channels, there still remains huge opportunities in customer service, planning, forecasting, pricing, assortment selection amongst others. The benefits will be manifold if we get it right.”
