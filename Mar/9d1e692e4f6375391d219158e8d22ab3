The need to imbibe family values will be the focal point in a new television show titled ‘Family Fame’ which is set to hit major television stations in Nigeria. Chief Executive Officer of Auxilia Media, producers of the pre-recorded show, Mrs. Olufunke Fajusigbe, described the show as the outcome of her commitment to seeing that Nigerians enjoy the best content in family unity. She added that the weekly show is tailored-fit for Nigerian households and designed to promote family unity. According to her, the show is different from others because of the great deal of values, pure entertainment, fun and originality it offers. “What makes a Nigerian family unique is the value. Everything is pulling families away and we felt we needed to do something to ensure the family is brought back together. Anything that will bring the family together will be a good venture economically and mentally.
