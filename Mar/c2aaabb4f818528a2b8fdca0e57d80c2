MIKEL Arteta has hinted Alexandre Lacazette’s Arsenal future could depend on where they finish in the Premier League this season. Arsenal are currently sitting fourth in the table and they are in the driving seat to qualify for the Champions League. Lacazette, however, faces an uncertain future as he is out of contract in the summer and Arsenal won’t start talks until then. And speaking about the striker’s future, Arteta hinted that which European competition the Gunners are playing in next season could have an impact.

The decision, we agreed, is to do it in the summer and we’re going to do it as soon as the season is finished. “We have to make decisions and we made that decision to finalise that at the end of the season. That’s what we’re going to have to do.” Arsenal are ready to back Arteta in the transfer market this summer, but Champions League football will affect their budget. “There are two things: the number of games that you have to play and the number of players you need in the squad,” said Arteta.
