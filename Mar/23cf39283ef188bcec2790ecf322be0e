Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, on Sunday, felicitated his Enugu State counterpart, Gov. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, on the occasion of his 58th birthday. Makinde, in a statement in Ibadan, by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Taiwo Adisa, described Ugwuanyi as a bridge-builder and a detribalised patriot with strong belief in the Nigeria project. He prayed to God to grant Ugwuanyi more years to serve his people and humanity at large. Makinde said the Enugu state governor, like his other colleagues in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), had shown that there is still hope for Nigeria. “And it is important to celebrate him and pray for long life and more grace for him.
