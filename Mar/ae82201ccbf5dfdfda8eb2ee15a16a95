The marriage of Olusoji, son of Nollywood veterans Olu Jacobs and Joke Silva, to his wife Blessing has ended. The union produced a child Oluwasoromidayo Atarah Jacobs in April 2019. It is unclear what led to the issues in their marriage. But Blessing, in now-deleted posts while answering questions from her followers via her Instagram Stories, disclosed her marital status. “Are you still married? my bro who is in the UK is madly in love with you,” a follower inquired. The UK-based mum responded with an emphatic no. “No. He will have to register for an interview o,” she stated.

Another fan then asked if there is any possibility of the pair coming together again. She said: “What God cannot do does not exist. However, there are some things that we don’t want God to do. You get it? If not, forget about it,” she added. Olusoji tied the knot with Blessing in July 2018. The spitting image of his famous dad is the General Manager of Lufodo Group, a company owned by his parents. His estranged wife is a public speaker and mental health advocate.
