World leaders should mount more pressure on Russia to end hostilities in Ukraine, Lagos State All Progressives Congress (APC) Secretary Sunmi Odesanya has said. In a statement in Lagos, Odesanya, a lawyer, said: “The Russian Federation, on February 24, 2022 chose the path of war with neighbouring Ukraine. Particularly enraged by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation’s (NATO) expansion towards Ukraine, and which it considers a clear national security threat, Russia invaded Ukraine in what marked another round of armed confrontation.   Fed Govt grants waiver for pre-departure quarantine…     Russian forces pummel Ukraine’s urban areas as convoy nears…     Crisis raises anxiety over energy flows, says OPEC   “The resumption of hostilities between Russia and Ukraine is very unsettling, not least because two close neighbours – or brothers if you will call them – are at war, which has resulted in human and material costs to both sides. “In what is similar to their 2014 armed conflict, hundreds are already killed with death toll expected to rise should both parties fail to agree to a ceasefire and an end to all hostilities in the interest of peace.” To prevent further escalations and bloodshed, Odesanya called on international community, as led by the United Nations (UN), to mediate between the warring countries and also ensure that the causes of the conflict are truthfully addressed in the interest of both parties.
