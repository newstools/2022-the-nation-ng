Nigeria international Sylvester Igboun has become the first African footballer to leave the Russian Premier League as a result of the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine. The 31-year-old forward has taken advantage of a Fifa rule allowing foreign players to leave the country, and has terminated his contract with FK Nizhny Novgorod. Igboun, whose deal expires at the end of the season, only joined Nizhny Novgorod last month after leaving Dynamo Moscow by mutual consent. “Sylvester has cancelled his contract because of the ongoing problem between Russia and Ukraine,” one of Igboun’s advisers told BBC Sport Africa.

Last week world governing body Fifa announced that foreign footballers playing in Russia can suspend their contracts and temporarily leave the country. The move came after Russian football clubs and national teams were suspended from all competitions “until further notice” by FIFA and UEFA.
