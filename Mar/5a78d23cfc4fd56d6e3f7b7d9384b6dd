The non-service of the application by the Attorney General of the Federal (AGF) on the suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Abba Kyari stalled hearing on Wednesday before a Federal High Court in Abuja in the extradition proceedings against Kyari. At the mention of the case on Wednesday, lawyer to Kyari, Nureini Jimoh (SAN) told the court that his client was not yet served with the extradition application filed by the AGF. AGF’s lawyer, Pius Akutah, the Head of the Central Authority Unit (CAU) at the Federal Ministry of Justice, confirmed that the applicant was yet to effect service on the respondent.   Defection: Court fixes April 11 for judgment in suit seeking…     2023: Ortom, Ishaku, Ugwuanyi, 34 others in PDP zoning…     Tambuwal meets IBB, Abdulsalami, says zoning won’t…   Akutah said the applicant could not serve before now because of Kyari’s involvement with the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA). He assured the court that the applicant would effect service on the respondent (Kyari) by March 24 and prayed the court for an adjournment. Jimoh, who did not object to the application for adjournment, said he was entitled, under the court’s rules, to 14 days, from the date of service, to file a response. Justice Inyang Ekwo has adjourned till April 27 for hearing.
