According to him: “The abductors were eight in number and came on foot with sophisticated weapons. They struggled to speak Hausa language to us but their language of communication is Fulani. “I think informants are the ones causing these incessant kidnaps because it seems their main target was the customs officer who arrived home from his duty post, just a day earlier.” The village head of the area, Muhammadu Nazifi, said: “Those kidnapped include his son, Jamalu, Muawiyya Gambo Turaki, a customs officer, who arrived home from his duty post just yesterday and his son Khalifa. “They also kidnapped a woman, Jamila Usman and another boy also called Khalifah. However, about four of them later escaped and returned home.”
