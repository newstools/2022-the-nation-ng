The Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) has apologised to passengers stranded when its train on the Lagos-Ibadan Standard gauge suddenly stopped on the way. It said the stoppage was as a result of “technical hitches” on the diesel- propelled locomotive engine and not due to lack of or insufficient fuel. Deputy Director Public Relations Mamood Yakub told The Nation the breakdown was due to technical fault on the fuelling system of the locomotive. This, he said, made the engineers to initially think of procuring more fuel until the fault was rectified.
