Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson on Thursday warned U.S. not to undermine China’s legitimate rights and interests in handling ties with Russia, otherwise, China would make firm and resolute responses. Spokesperson Zhao Lijian was responding to a query about recent claims by a few countries including the U.S. which said China has not made concrete measures to help resolve the conflict in Ukraine, nor has it coordinated with the West to impose sanctions on Russia. “For those accusing China of ‘looking on unconcerned’ on the Ukraine issue, they should first ask themselves what role they have played in the crisis?” Zhao asked. On the Ukraine issue, Zhao said China has always adopted an objective and fair attitude, made judgments independently based on the merits of the matter itself, and played a constructive role in promoting peace talks.   Russia no longer wants to work with Council of Europe     Ukraine crisis: Damage to EU worse than COVID-19 pandemic –…     U.S. House approves Ukraine humanitarian and military aid   “We hope the relevant sides can keep calm, restrained, encourage and support all diplomatic efforts conducive to the peaceful settlement of the Ukraine crisis, so as to jointly help cool down the situation.’’ Zhao said it has been proven by practice that sanctions would not solve problems, on the contrary, they would lead to new problems. He added that sanctions will not only result in two or multiple economic losers but also disturb the process of a political settlement, which was “not constructive at all. According to Zhao, in handling ties with Russia, U.S. side should not impose the so-called sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction on Chinese enterprises and individuals, or damage China’s legitimate rights and interests, otherwise China will make firm and resolute responses.
