The Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited at the weekend said it sold 1.39billion litres/day amounting to 46.31million litres/day in September 2021. The figures were contained in the September 2021 NNPC Monthly Financial and Operations Report (MFOR), according to Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division Malam Garba Deen Muhammad. He said: “in the Downstream sector, to ensure uninterrupted supply and effective distribution of petrol across the country, a total of 1.39billion litres translating to 46.31million litres/day was supplied for the month of September 2021.” NNPC also announced a trading surplus of ₦37.50billion for the month of September 2021 representing a 352% increase from the ₦8.29billion surplus in August 2021. The record indicates that the rise in trading surplus was largely due to the increased earnings of NNPC’s Upstream subsidiary, the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC). Trading surplus or trading deficit is derived after deduction of the expenditure profile from the revenue in the period under review. Thus in September 2021, NNPC Group’s operating revenue as compared to August 2021, reduced by 29.87% or N191.90billion to stand at N450.45billion.
