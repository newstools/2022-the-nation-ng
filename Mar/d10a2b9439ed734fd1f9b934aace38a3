The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on Wednesday night released former Anambra State Governor Willie Obiano on administrative bail. The EFCC had initially refused to release Obiano on administrative bail last weekend but reversed its decision on Monday when it granted the former governor bail with stringent conditions. Unable to meet some of the conditions, Obiano was held by the EFCC while his friends and associates made efforts to secure his release. Obiano finally met the conditions on Wednesday night, after which he was released to members of his family.
