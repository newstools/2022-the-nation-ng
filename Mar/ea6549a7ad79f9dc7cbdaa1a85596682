The national grid collapsed on Monday at 10:40 am according to the Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC). The breakdown in transmission came not up to 24 hours after the electricity Generation Companies (GenCos) accused the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) of inefficient management of the grid. A statement by the AEDC Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Donald Etim in Abuja notified the company’s consumers that the grid collapse caused the general outage in its franchise areas.
