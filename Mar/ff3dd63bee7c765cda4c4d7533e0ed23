A 45-year old man, Franklin Ebuka, is on the run after he allegedly poured hot soup on a food vendor identified as Akenom Israel. Sources said Ebuka reportedly committed the offence when he met his wife and the victim in an argument over a missing phone. Ebuka’s wife and the victim sell food near a popular hotel along Oba Adesida road, Akure. Akenom, who spoke while receiving treatment, said he was shocked when Ebuka poured the soup on him without provocation. “After we were done at about 1.00am, my wife asked her sister for the phone. But the lady told her that one Sola, a commercial motorcyclist came and snatched it from her, thinking that he would soon bring it back.
