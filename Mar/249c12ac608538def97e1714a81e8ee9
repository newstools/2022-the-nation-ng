The Lagos State Parks and Gardens Agency (LASPARK) has distributed free tree seedlings to guests at the 25th Convocation Ceremony of the Lagos State University (LASU), at the Buba Marwa Auditorium, Ojo. According to its General Manager, Mrs. Adetoun Popoola, the exercise was in furtherance of the agency’s awareness and sensitisation drive aimed at stimulating and awakening the consciousness of residents to plant trees for the protection of the ecosystem.

We are giving out free plants and educating the audience on how to plant a tree,” she added. The general manager acknowledged that the sensitisation exercise afforded the agency the opportunity to interact and have one-on-one conversations with some of the visitors to know their disposition towards planting, stressing that feedback generated would help reinforce the organisation’s advocacy programmes.
