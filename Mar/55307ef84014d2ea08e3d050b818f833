Female enthusiast and philanthropist extraordinaire, Funke Felix-Adejumo has taken the challenges of African women to the global centre stage stressing the need for more realistic gender inclusion. The author of “More than a woman,” was at the concluded Commonwealth Africa Initiative in London, England where she extolled the virtues of African women and raised other issues affecting the productivity of women. At Plenary Session 6 with the theme: Commonwealth women in leadership during the COVID-19 role in building back better, Felix-Adejumo, with leading African voices such as Southern Africa’s Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma and Fatimah Mohammed Habib, Founder/Executive director of Advocacy For Humanity, advocated for a more inclusive policy that will engender women participation in policymaking, religious circles, health, education, among other critical subjects.

She encouraged women placed in positions of leadership by God to not pay attention to noise-making because there will always be criticism. She cited the Wright Brothers, the pioneers of aviation who suffered grave criticism from critics as a case in point, saying, women and everyone will always be criticised but they must be determined to forge forward. Felix-Adejumo was decorated with a prestigious Commonwealth Award for her contributions to women’s empowerment. The woman crusader was with Councillor Trish Fivey, The Worshipful the Mayor of the London Borough of Sutton, who was in attendance.
