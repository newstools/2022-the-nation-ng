Six-time Olympian Olufunke Oshonaike returns to the international scene from today at the qualifying round of the World Table Tennis (WTT) Singapore Smash 2022 alongside compatriot – Edem Offiong as they both compete in the Women’s Singles of the $2m prize money championships. Oshonaike’s last outing at any international tournament was at the September 2021 African Championships in Cameroon, where she was beaten in the knockout stage by Egyptian teenager Hana Goda. In the Women’s Singles qualifying draw, it will be a tough ask for Oshonaike when she meets Singapore’s Koh Kai Xin Pearlyn. The hometown crowd will look to carry Koh over the line, but the experience of the former African champion may be the winning ingredient. Also, Offiong who remains Nigeria’s best-ranked female player in the world will face Turkey’s Ozge Yilmaz and former African champion Cameroon’s Sarah Hanffou will also be up against Serbia’s Andrea Todorovic as Africa looks to make its mark at the year’s biggest event.   22 injured at Mexican football match     Firm to unveil football fund for investors     Joshua picks new head trainer for Usysk rematch   Expected to start campaigns from the main draws are Quadri Aruna and Egyptian contingent led by Omar Assar, Dina Meshref, Ahmed Saleh, Yousra Helmy.
