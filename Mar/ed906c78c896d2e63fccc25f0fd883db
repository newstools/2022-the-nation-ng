Russia on Thursday warned the U.S. that Moscow had the might to put the United States in its place and accused the West of stoking a wild Russophobic plot to tear Russia apart. Dmitry Medvedev, who served as president from 2008 to 2012 and now deputy secretary of Russia’s Security Council, said the United States had stoked “disgusting” Russophobia in an attempt to force Russia to its knees. “It will not work, Russia has the might to put all of our brash enemies in their place,” Medvedev said. Since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, the United States and its European and Asian allies have slapped sanctions on Russian leaders, companies and businessmen, cutting off Russia from much of the world economy.

Ukraine says it was fighting for its existence and that Putin’s claims of genocide are nonsense. The West also said claims that it wants to rip Russia apart are baseless. Russia added that in spite of sanctions it can fare well without what it casts as a deceitful and decadent West led by the United States. It said its bid to forge ties with the West after the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union was now over and that it would develop ties with other powers such as China. (Reuters/NAN)
