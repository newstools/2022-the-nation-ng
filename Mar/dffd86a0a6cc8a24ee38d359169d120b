The Maria Assumpta Cathedral Catholic Archdiocese, Owerri, Imo State, on Sunday night went up in flames. An eyewitness said the fire started around 11:48 pm and affected only a section of the main church building and many equipment. A Catholic Priest, who pleaded anonymity, said that it was caused by an electrical fault. “The fire was not that much. It was as a result an electrical fault. It started from a room in the church where most of the wire connection was done. It damaged so many things. You know there was no how a fire will not damage something. “By God’s grace, the fire did not go far, with the efforts of other people in the church and passersby it was put off. So it’s just an electrical fault,” the priest said.
