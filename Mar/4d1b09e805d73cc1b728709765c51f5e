Fifty Abia State students studying in universities and polytechnics across the country have been selected as potential beneficiaries of the annual educational scholarship organised by the Dr. Alex Otti Foundation. The students were shortlisted after screening by a foreign consultant. Speaking in Umuahia, the Abia State capital, the Executive Director, Alex Otti Foundation, Mr. Chinedu Ekeke, said the selected undergraduates were students of Abia origin living outside the state and those in the state. Ekeke, who disclosed that the students were in their second year in institutions across the country, said the aim of the foundation was to produce people capable of becoming leaders of tomorrow. He said the students must maintain CPGA of 3.5 for universities and 2.8 CPGA for polytechnics throughout their studies to enjoy the scholarship. Ekeke said the N150, 000 per academic year would be a financial relief for parents.

It is a way of giving back to the society. It is a way of raising scholars and leaders of tomorrow. “The scholarship is for the downtrodden; people whose parents cannot afford to pay their school fees, but are brilliant. “They are going to be screened by a panel comprising people from professional background. “The successful ones will be contacted and invited to a banquet with the founder of the foundation, Otti, where their cheques will be presented to them. “It is of international standard, as there was no human interface before or during the selection process. The current consultant is doing something for the World Economic Forum. Another is a lecturer at Manchester University, United Kingdom. So, it has a transparent process. “We had 35 beneficiaries last year and if these 50 people make the final list, they will be taken in.”
