Nigerian international Terem Moffi is reportedly a major doubt for Lorient’s crucial Ligue 1 clash at Clermont Font on Sunday. Moffi has been sick since the beginning of the week after going down with the flu. The former Kortrijk star netted Lorient’s only goal as they fell to a crushing 4-1 defeat to Lyon last weekend. That strike was Moffi’s fourth league goal of the season for struggling Lorient, a tally well below his incredible 14-goal haul in his debut campaign. Still, the 22-year-old remains one of Lorient’s biggest stars, making him vital to the club’s survival hopes.

A victory over Clermont at the Stade Gabriel Montpied, Clermont-Ferrand, could lift Lorient to within one point of 15th -place Clermont and out of troubled waters, if other results go their way. Despite his poor returns in front of goal, Moffi is still Lorient’s leading goalscorer and his presence could swing the game in his side’s favour. However, the Super Eagles striker, according to Ouest-France, has not joined team training this week, with his club boss still unsure if he can count on a match-fit Moffi.
