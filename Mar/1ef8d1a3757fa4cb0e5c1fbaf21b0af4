UNITED Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation ( FAO) has begun a project to boost catfish production and unlock the potential of sustainable fisheries and aquaculture in Nigeria. The project, FISH4ACP, is an initiative of the Organisation of African, Caribbean and Pacific States ( OACPS) contributing to food and nutrition security, prosperity and job creation by ensuring the sustainability of fisheries and aquaculture value chains in Africa,  Caribbean and the Pacific. The project, it said, would allow Nigeria to benefit from the African catfish value chain, worth $625 million. Speaking at the FISH4ACP Validation Workshop and Value Chain Task Force Meeting in Abuja yesterday, FAO Representative in Nigeria Fred Kafeero said the FISH4ACP project would pay attention to small and medium-sized businesses.
