The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) yesterday said it had launched an investigation into a viral video of corps members dancing at a yet-to-be identified orientation camp. In the video that has now gone viral on social media, one female corps member is seen giving a lap dance to a male counterpart. The video also shows the corps members engaging in an erotic dance.
