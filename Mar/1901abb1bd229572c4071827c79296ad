Vice-President and facility sub-committee Chairman of the Nigeria Cricket Federation, Oyewole Obalola, has said that the newly upgraded Tafawa Balewa Square Cricket Turf in Lagos will be a good test for the national women’s team, when the 6-nation invitational tournament gets underway later in the month.  “The campaign to have better Cricket playing facility is one of the cardinal goals of Federation and, we are glad that our prime facility, the Tafawa Balewa Square Oval is now at par with international standard,” Obalola said He further explained that the lack of top-grade cricket turf wickets has been one of the limiting factors for developing top cricket talents in the past, adding the current spate of development of facilities across the country will help relegate that to the background. He said: “Before now, we usually plan a training tour for our teams to go have a go at some turfs wickets in some countries, as part of our international event’s participation procedure, which is additional cost, time and resources to us and to cap it all up, most of the time, we gain little for to help us take on the more experienced sides.”   And Tiger wept!
