Robert Lewandowski could be a shock target for Barcelona, according to reports in Spain. The Bayern Munich striker has one year left on his current contract at the Allianz Arena and is yet to pen a new deal with the German giants.

Catalan newspaper Sport is reporting that Barcelona are prepared to take advantage of the contract stalemate by offering the Polish international a four-year deal to move to the Nou Camp. The paper reports that Lewandowski might be seen as an alternative to Erling Haaland who may prove too costly a purchase. Despite his age, Barca apparently believe Lewandowski can keep performing at the top level for a further two years.
