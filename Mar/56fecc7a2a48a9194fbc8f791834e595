Super Eagles interim manager Augustine Eguavoen would expectedly be checking on William Troost-Ekong today as he provided an update on the Watford defender’s injury after he was included in the Super Eagles’ squad for games against Ghana later this month. The centre-back has not played a minute of football for the Hornets since returning from the African Cup of Nations earlier this year. That has been a result of the improvement seen in defence under Roy Hodgson, with Craig Cathcart and Samir keeping other options out of the starting XI.

But Eguavoen has reportedly said they were not panicking about the injury and that they expected the defender to be fit again soon, hopefully in time for their World Cup play-off matches against Ghana on March 25 and March 29. “We will find out. I spoke with Troost-Ekong some three days ago and he’s going to have a look at it and then I’ll call him again tomorrow to determine the extent of the injury,” Eguavoen told allnigeriasoccer.com.“Three days ago he told me it isn’t that bad so let us not push the panic button. “He told me he was going to miss the Arsenal game, I said I’ll speak with him after the Arsenal game, I have not done that yet. I will speak with him tonight or tomorrow.”
