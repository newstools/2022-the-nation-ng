Simba TVS, tricycle (Keke) distributor in Nigeria, has unveiled the TVS King Deluxe Plus iTouch, the latest version of its innovative three-wheeler vehicles at two impressive launch ceremonies in Enugu and Asaba. These latest launches come on the heels of a very successful national launch held in Lagos in December last year and is in furtherance of the organisation’s efforts to enhance last-mile commute for Nigerians and boost earnings of keke operators.   Okorie emerges winner at 9mobile FutureCEO initiative     ‘Being homeless in UK spurred my humanitarian side’     VAT war: how far can FG, states go?   Speaking at the ceremony in Enugu, Rana Sandeep, Regional Business Manager, South-East at Simba Group, revealed that “PLUS” means more convenience, more comfort, more earnings and more security, stressing that the TVS King Deluxe Plus iTouch will ensure operators maximize their earning with more than 10 additional features added to the keke such as the iTouch start for smooth silent staring of the keke, strengthened chassis, longer and more convenient driver seats, triple filter and so much more. According to him, “The TVS Deluxe Plus iTouch comes with the patented Integrated Starter Generator (ISG) Technology, the very first time in the 3 wheeler segment. The ISG or iTouch has several benefits such as: the feather-touch start and stop which is noiseless and smooth, fewer parts to worry about with the removal of the starter motor which reduces cost of maintenance, next gen technology for fuel savings especially when starting and stopping multiple times in traffic.” Also speaking at the event, the Divisional Head of Marketing for Simba TVS, Mr. Taiwo Akinpelu, in his welcome address, said Simba TVS has remained committed to bridging the gap of last mile transportation for passengers and goods in Nigeria adding that three-wheelers play a tremendous role in the mass transit scheme as they fill the last-mile gap, taking passengers and goods from major bus stops to their final residence.
