Former Nigeria’s international football players have commended All Progressives Congress National Leader, Asíwájú Bola Tinubu, for his contributions to democracy and good governance as well as sports development in the country. They made the commendation when they visited Tinubu on Saturday in Lagos to congratulate him on his 70th birthday which comes up on March 29. The ex-Super Eagles players included former Eagles’ goalkeepers, Peter Rufai, Ike Shorunmu, and Dosu Joseph, ex-Eagles’ captains Austin Jay Jay Okocha, and Nwankwo Kanu, defenders Taribo West and Uche Okechukwu, Obafemi Martins, Tijani Babangida, Victor Ikpeba and Mutiu Adepoju. Lauding Tinubu, particularly for his achievements in Lagos, Okocha said the former Lagos governor is the reason why he usually calls Lagos home.

Pastor Taribo West prayed for Nigeria to be blessed with more kind-hearted people like Asiwaju while wishing him well in the presidential race. Mentioning their names one by one with their nicknames while playing for the country, Asiwaju Tinubu thanked them for their exploits on the field of play, for putting smiles on the faces of many, and for helping to put Nigeria’s name on the global map. He said the former players gave Nigerians a sense of immense pride and a source of inspiration, particularly the young ones.
