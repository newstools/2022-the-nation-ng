Super Eagles Assistant captain, William Troost Ekong, has assured Nigerians that he is fit and ready for the 2022 World Cup playoffs against the Black Stars of Ghana with the first leg slated for the Baba Yara Stadium in Kumasi tomorrow.  Initially reported to miss out of the World Cup playoffs , the Watford defender rued the miscommunication during a press conference to herald the Friday’s tie. “I think there were some miscommunications in the press concerning the length of my injury recovery. I had a small injury but I have recovered,” Ekong said. “I am back fit. If I wasn’t fit I won’t be here today because I know we have other quality players that could replace me. I feel good now and I have been training for two weeks now.”   Eguavoen defends inclusion of Bonke, Noble     Chukwu tips Eagles to overrun Black Stars     “33” Export Lager charges Super Eagles to soar in Kumasi   The former Udinese defender also expressed his delight at the choice of the MKO Abiola Stadium, Abuja for the return leg on Tuesday, adding the Super Eagles would approach the two games with the hunger and desire to pick the World Cup ticket. “It is very good.
