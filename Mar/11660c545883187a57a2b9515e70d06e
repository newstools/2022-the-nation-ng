Premier League games will not be shown on Russian television after it suspended its agreement with broadcast partner Rambler (Okko Sport). The decision was made at a shareholders’ meeting in London on Tuesday as the governing body continues to react to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The Premier League will also donate £1million to support the people affected by the war. A statement read: “The Premier League and its clubs today unanimously agreed to suspend our agreement with Russian broadcast partner Rambler (Okko Sport) with immediate effect and to donate £1million to support the people of Ukraine.  “The League strongly condemns Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. We call for peace and our thoughts are with all those impacted.

The statement added: “This message of solidarity was visible to fans around the world across Premier League digital channels and via match broadcasts.  “This is in addition to the numerous ways in which clubs continue to display their support.” The Football Association has also suspended its partnership with Russian broadcasters over rights for the FA Cup with immediate effect. The government has endorsed the Premier League’s decision, with sports minister Nigel Huddleston saying Russian president Vladimir Putin must remain a “pariah”.
