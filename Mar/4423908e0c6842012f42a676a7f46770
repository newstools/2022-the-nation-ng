Former Ghana Football Association [GFA] chairman, Dr Nyaho Nyaho-Tamakloe has urged the Black Stars to shed blood on the pitch in order to pip the Super Eagles to the Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup ticket. The first leg of the decisive play-off ties hold tomorrow at the Baba Yara Stadium in Kumasi with the reverse fixture coming up at the Moshood Abiola Stadium in Abuja next Tuesday. But Nyaho-Tamakloe according to mordernghana.com has pleaded with the Black Stars players to show eagerness and hunger against Nigeria in the 2022 World Cup playoff games, adding they will have the needed support from the country. “This game is not about the Ghana Football Association or the technical team, it is about the players,” he said on Asempa FM. “The players must be prepared to die on the pitch against Nigeria. We know what goes into such games. “I don’t know any of the players but I believe when they show on the pitch that they are ready to sacrifice, they will surely have the support from Ghanaians,” he added.
