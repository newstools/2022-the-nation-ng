The Central of Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is seeking increased private sector participation in dairy to position the industry for  growth and    economic growth. A representative of the apex bank, Garba Aminu, who spoke during the opening of a  Milk Collection Centre (MCC) in Kano, established by Outspan Nigeria Limited, the dairy business unit of Olam Food Ingredients (ofi), reiterated  that the bank would support investors to  help   dairy processors   meet  growing demand for local  milk products. Aminu  emphasised CBN’s  commitment to providing the necessary assistance to businesses and smallholder farmers in a bid to fast track the attainment of food production self-sufficiency in the country. Also the Doguwa communities where the project is sited  applauded Outspan Nigeria Limited, for its expansive investment in the area, targeted at achieving large-scale development of the local dairy value chain.

The Chairman,  Doguwa Local Government Council,Mamuda Hudu,  was delighted by the prospect of local dairy farmers and the women in the area gaining access to new markets and opportunities to sell their milk to large industrial off-takers instead of trekking to distant towns to peddle their products. “Outspan Nigeria Limited is making an impactful investment in our communities by building a milk collection centre in Doguwa LGA. The collection centre will enhance the economic activities of our local dairy farmers and help our young people get jobs in the dairy value chain,” Hudu said “Our women who previously trekked miles to sell their milk in distant markets can now stay home and look after their children with the assurance that the milk collection centre would help preserve and transport their raw milk to larger off-takers who are ready to pay them accordingly.”
