Akwa Ibom State Governor Udom Emmanuel has appealed to beneficiaries of compensation paid to clear the Right-of Way at the Nsit Ubium-Eket axis of the Eket-Etinan Road to vacate. He spoke at the weekend at a funeral service held in honour of a prominent Akwa Ibom indigene, Pastor Benjamin Bassey, at Afaha Atai in Eket Local Government. “If you have been paid compensation, please vacate in peace. We are a government of peace. Those compensations are based on professional evaluation. “We don’t like chasing people out, but please don’t take us for granted. We have given money; some people have collected the compensation and refused to leave.

So, let those people peacefully give us the Right-of-Way so that we can finish the work in time. “I have just approximately one year for my administration to end. We are determined to tidy what we are doing in the state as soon as possible,’’ Emmanuel said. He hailed the pace of work by the Chinese company building the Eket-Etinan Road. The governor sought the cooperation of all to expedite the completion of a dual thoroughfare from Nsit Ubium across Okon axis to Eket Roundabout. He commiserated with the bereaved family of Pastor Bassey and praised all that organised the befitting funeral.
