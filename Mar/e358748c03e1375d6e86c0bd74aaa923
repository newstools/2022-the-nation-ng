The Northeast Development Commission (NEDC) has held a consultative meeting with interest groups in Adamawa State for inputs into the development of its proposed 10-year plan to develop the Northeast. At its Consultative and Engagement Meeting with stakeholders on the Northeast Stabilisation and Development Master Plan (NESDMP) Project yesterday in Yola, the NEDC explained that it was developing a regional master plan to correct the damage done to the Northeast by the Boko Haram terrorists. “The master plan will identify the needs of the region and spell out strategies and immediate and long-term interventions for the recovery, stabilisation, renewal and sustainable development of the region,” the NEDC Managing Director, Mohammed Alkali explained.

Mohammed Alkali, who was represented during the meeting at the Fombina Ambassador Royal Suits in Yola by Prof. Bobboi Umar, said the proposed master plan is part of the main objectives of setting up the NEDC. Noting that the NEDC was established by President Muhammadu Buhari as a direct response to the devastation that the Northeast went through in the hands of Boko Haram, the NEDC chief executive said the commission is charged with the responsibility to recover, stabilise and develop the region.
