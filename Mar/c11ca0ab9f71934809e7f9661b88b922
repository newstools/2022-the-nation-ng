BudgIt revealed that the Federal Government (FG) only commits N3,453 to the health of each Nigerian in its budgetary allocations. It said that although Nigeria is a signatory to the Abuja declaration which places all West African countries on the pedestal of committing 15% of their budget to health care, Nigeria has never met hers.
