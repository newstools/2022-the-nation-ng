Barcelona advanced to the Europa League quarter-finals last night as they came from behind to secure a 2-1 victory over Galatasaray in Istanbul. The hosts took an early lead through a Marcao header, but the Blaugrana staged a fine comeback with goals from Pedri and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. The first major chance of the game fell Barcelona’s way after 10 minutes, as Frenkie De Jong found himself one-on-one with Inaki Pena, but his shot went just wide of the far post. Galatasaray took the lead after 28 minutes, as an out-swinging corner was met by Marcao, who powered his header home. Barcelona were level nine minutes later courtesy of a stunning Pedri strike. Ferran Torres found the 19-year-old with a delightful reverse pass, and the youngster sidestepped two slide tackles before coolly slotting home.

The game then descended into a bitty affair, with Barcelona dominating possession and pinning Galatasaray back, but were unable to increase their lead. That said, the home side did have a couple of opportunities. Mohamed flashed a shot just off target, before Kerem got in behind the Barcelona defence and raced towards goal, but his cross to Morutan was too far ahead of the player. Barcelona looked to have wrapped up the tie in added time as Ferran Torres found himself in space in the box, but his chipped effort came back off the bar, before the assistant referee’s flag went up to indicate offside. However, Xavi Hernandez’s side had done enough, and will be in the Friday’s draw for the of the Europa League last eight.
