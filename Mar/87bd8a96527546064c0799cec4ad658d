The London-based Nigerian singer, Daayuur describes the new effort as a love rendition that is aimed at appreciating the female folks. “My new single, You Bad, is a love song that is never seen before. Maybe I should not say never before because there is no new thing under the sun, but I can say for sure and you can take it to the bank that it is a different thing. The message of the song is basically to appreciate the female folks out there. Their virtue as well as their beautiful physical appearance.
