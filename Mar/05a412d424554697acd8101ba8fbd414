He explained that the NGA is focussed on seven thematic areas in its bid to drive gas development in the country. ” The most important area is that gas must provide power and electricity for Nigerians (Gas for Power). We are also keen to see that gas is used for cooking (Gas for homes).Gas must drive Nigeria’s industrialisation. And Nigeria must play in the international markets with regards gas” he said.
