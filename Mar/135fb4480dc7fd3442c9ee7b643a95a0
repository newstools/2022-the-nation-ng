Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, on Sunday described the national convention of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) held in Abuja on Saturday as “peaceful, successful and historic.” Ganduje, who chaired the Protocols Sub-committee for the convention, disclosed that the peaceful and successful conduct of the APC national convention was because the governors and key stakeholders heeded President Muhammadu Buhari’s advice that the party should go on consensus arrangement in getting its national officers, which led to Senator Abudullahi Adamu emerging as national chairman. “It wouldn’t have been that easy and peaceful if we had not listened to the president’s advice,” the governor stated in a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary (CPS) Abba Anwar.

To effectively comply with his advice, we undertook a lot of consensus in the exercise. “In areas where consensus did not work, they had to go into election with all the proper procedures for election. “You can see that they counted votes and some announcements were made. All winners who emerged were announced and there were no protests,” he said. Governor Ganduje appreciated that at the end of the exercise two things were achieved: “We have come up with a new brand leadership. And secondly, this exercise has made us more united and stronger. And we are sure we are equal to the task in 2023.”
