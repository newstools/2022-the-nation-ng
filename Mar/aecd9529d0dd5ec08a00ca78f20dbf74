Peter Okoye aka Peter Psquare or Mr P has opened up on the possibility of the P-Square hosting a concert at the highly coveted London O2 Arena. Following Davido’s successful sold-out musical outing where he utterly ‘shut down’ the O2 arena, Mr P has hinted they are most likely the next Nigerian music stars to keep the arena on lockdown He argued others may have had a ‘shutdown’ show but theirs will be distinct as they’ll be ‘closing down’ the arena instead. The singer, via his Twitter handle, asked fans to choose between the O2 arena or Wembley Stadium but noted the former is calling the P-square group.
