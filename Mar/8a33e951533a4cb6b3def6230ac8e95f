Its National President Mr Dike Ifeanyi, who spoke in a statement in Abuja, called on the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) to encourage the donkey business in the country. He said the NCS should encourage development of ranches and support breeding of donkeys,which Nigeria Agricultural Quarantine services (NAQS) has mapped out as solution to the depleting population of donkey in Nigeria.
