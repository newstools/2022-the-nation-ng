The international community is united in its support of Ukraine and is taking “unprecedented” measures, Kishida said He said Japan would also continue to support these efforts. Earlier, Kishida had told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that his country would provide Ukraine with humanitarian aid worth 100 million dollars.
