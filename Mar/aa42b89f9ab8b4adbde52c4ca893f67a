AFEX Commodities Exchange has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Niger State Ministry of Agriculture and the Niger State Commodity and Export Promotion Agency (NSCEPA) to improve productivity and livelihoods of Niger State farmers and to empower the youths in the state. The partnership will see AFEX developing processing facilities including a sesame cleaning center in Lapai/Agaie. It will also include the deployment of operations that will enable financial inclusion for Niger State farmers alongside the provision of storage and extension services that will facilitate crop standardization and protection. As a party in the MoU, AFEX will also deploy its Agric Service Provider model in Niger State, which would include supporting, training, and financing other commercial agriculture service providers in the state.

According to him, “infrastructure shortfalls are mostly related to the unavailability of adequate and affordable storage for farmers, among other things,” he explained, adding that “limited financing also has an effect on the value chain from a demand and supply standpoint.” Balogun indicated that with the partnership with the Niger State Ministry of Agriculture and the Niger State Commodity and Export Promotion Agency, things are about to change positively for the Niger State farmers. “We are on a mission to increase the productivity and livelihoods of farmers in Niger State,” Balogun said.
