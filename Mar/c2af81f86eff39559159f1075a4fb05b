An Islamic cleric, Dr. Sheikh A.A. Usman has advised religious leaders to desist from false prophecies especially the ones that have to deal with politics. In a recent chat with The Nation, the cleric noted that prophecies that have to do with politics would always put ‘Men of God’ in bad light amongst the populace. According to him, most of the prophecies by the so-called men of God usually turn out to be fake, or just a mere prediction of events that are naturally bound to happen, in any case.

Sheikh Usman therefore, warned that he would be on the lookout for prophets regardless of their religion, who would still be coming out to issue political prophecies as he would begin to challenge them openly. This, he said, is because apart from causing confusion amongst the people, they are also giving the religions of God a bad name for their selfish interest which true men of God should rise up against. “Why did they not see kidnappers, ritualists, criminal herdsmen, and spiritual problems afflicting even some of their own family members and pray to avert them?” He asked rhetorically; before calling on people to always disregard political prophecies from ‘Men of God’ because such prophecies are usually fake.”
