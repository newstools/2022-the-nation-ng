With the spiraling number of obstacles in the Aviation Industry, Nesto Aviation Services Limited (NestAv), the aviation arm of the Obijackson Group, has restated its capability to surmount industry challenges and plans to expand the business operations in its areas of focus through its fleet of helicopters and Jets. The General Manager, NestAv, Mr. Ehis Uadiale who is also an Oil and Gas / Aviation expert, said the company is focused on consolidating its business plans, increasing its market share in the industry while working on its fleet expansion plan. He called for a consolidation of airline operators to enable capacity building in delivering premium value to its target market. “We need to have consolidated efforts in the industry where people with the same business idea, come together to achieve the required capacity to ensure operators deliver on promised frequencies without fail,” he said.

This, he added, would eradicate scheduled flight operators’ inability to airlift passengers and cancellations. He also called for a closer synergy between regulating agencies. He added that a huge challenge for airline operators is the high foreign exchange rates which affect the cost of fleet maintenance and the cost of procuring aircraft spare parts. “The government needs to look at fiscal policies that would help to stabilize the Nigerian currency. The fluctuating exchange rate compounds the cost of operating in Nigeria and this is in addition to the aviation fuel scarcity which is the reason a lot of airline operators cease operations” Uadiale added.
