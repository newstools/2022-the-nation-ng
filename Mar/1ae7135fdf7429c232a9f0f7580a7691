Meanwhile, Lagos State chapter of the Sports Writers Association of Nigeria (Lagos SWAN) has urged the Federal Government to immortalize the late doyen of Sportscasting in Nigeria, Fabio Lanipekun. The Chairman of the most vibrant chapter of the association, Debo Oshundun stated this in a statement shortly after the demise of the highly revered journalist on Sunday. According to him, late Fabio’s feat in sports writing and development in Nigeria deserves all commendations and be accorded all respect.

We appeal to the Federal Government and the Lagos State government to immortalize Fabio, just as they did with ace commentators, Ishola Folorunsho and Ernest Okonkwo by naming a section of the Teslim Balogun Stadium after them.” Despite dropping his pen at the ripe age of 80, Oshundun commended the veteran sport journalist’s contributions saying his advice will be missed in the pen pushing profession. “Pa Fabio was one of those we ran to for advice and now that he’s gone we are going to miss him deeply. “He left a big shoe that’s very difficult for anybody to step into but we pray for the repose of his soul and also pray for the family at this difficult time,” Oshundun added.
