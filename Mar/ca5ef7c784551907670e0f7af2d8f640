Music superstar D’banj has revealed how Kennis Music record label boss, Kenny Keke Ogungbe ignored him as an upcoming artist before he met Don Jazzy. D’banj made this revelation during a recent performance, where Ogungbe and his business associate, Dayo D1 Adeneye were guests. Narrating his experience, D’banj told the audience how he saw Ogungbe while somewhere around Isolo, Lagos, and stepped out of his 1990 Golf car to introduce himself but the label owner didn’t pay him desired attention. He noted that he eventually gave his demo CD to Ogungbe who threw it on his seat and zoomed off.   Lady Donli: Sacrifice I made for my music     Onos Morgan goes for gold in Italy     Yoruba films give more fame, Alesh   D’banj said: “I was in Isolo going to LASU in my 1990 Golf, I was driving on the other lane, before God and man, Baba Keke passed, I did what any young entrepreneur would do, I turned my car and followed him. I parked my car and came out with my CD – that time I never meet Don Jazzy oh – I rush go baba car and knocked on the window looking like a traffic thief. I don’t even know my name then.” He continues: “I kept knocking until he wound down the glass and I gave him my CD which he threw on the seat. Although, I got some calls later but shortly after, I got my visa to the UK where I met Don Jazzy and the story became history. But for even seeing him inspired me. “Now that I get such requests, I kind of understand his reaction then but at that time, I no understand oh.”
