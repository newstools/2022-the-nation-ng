I got a beautiful breakfast. On my birthday, this person was hosting the red carpet and then we had another presenter though he wasn’t popular then so I told her once you interview celebrities, pass to this guy. Guess what? They are married now with twins.” He further revealed that he is currently nursing a recent heartbreak. “The last breakfast that just happened to me was on Valentine’s Day. I had done all the rounds and arranged for Valentine’s Day to be special with lots of gifts and when I like, I’m a hopeless romantic. I always tell people, love is like war, easy to begin but hard to end. I’m in a process of heavy heartbreak but I will deal with it. That’s why I distract myself with so much work.”
