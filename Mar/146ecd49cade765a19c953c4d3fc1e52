Following Russia’s suspension from the Council of Europe, the country no longer wants to participate in the work of the body, the Russian Foreign Ministry in Moscow says. “Russia will not participate in the transformation of Europe’s oldest organisation by NATO and the EU, which obediently follows it, into another platform for Western domination and narcissism. “They should have fun communicating with each other, without Russia,” a statement said. The exit from the Council of Europe also entails the exit from all mechanisms,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said.

Russia repeatedly complains of alleged discrimination. The council had reacted to the Russian attack on Ukraine by suspending it. This decision was considered historic. Russia temporarily lost its representation rights in the Strasbourg-based organisation. Meanwhile, the country will formally remain a member until the end of the financial year, Russian politicians in Moscow emphasised. (dpa/NAN)
