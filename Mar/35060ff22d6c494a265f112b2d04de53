Hearing on the alleged murder of a Master’s student of Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ile-Ife, Timothy Adegoke, began yesterday before a High Court in Osogbo, Osun State presided over by Chief Judge of the state, Justice Oyebola Ojo. Three prosecution witnesses were scheduled to testify against Hilton Hotel owner, Dr Rahmon Adedoyin and six other staff members. The three witnesses, identified as Adenike Adewoyin (PW1), Bolatito Adegoke (PW2) and Gbade Adegoke(PW3), were led in evidence by the prosecutor, M O. Omosun. Adewoyin, a serving National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) member, told the court that the late Timothy was her cousin, and that she reported his disappearance to Edunagbon police station after his widow, Mrs Bolatito Adegoke, informed her that she was unable to reach him on the phone since November 6, 2021.

Defence counsel, Adekunle Adegoke, pointed out to her that, according to her telephone conversation with her husband before his death, Timothy was ill and she was urging him to use his drugs. Another defence counsel, K. K Eleja, SAN, pointed out to Gbade, elder brother to the deceased, that while he was giving evidence before the court, he claimed that he saw bloodstains on the wall of Room 305 allocated to his younger brother and observed that the room door was broken but refused to mention that in his statement to the police, which shows inconsistency in his account. Justice Ojo refused to admit the suspects to bail and adjourned the matter till March 8.
