That is the first principle of post-election management. “One must therefore not be taken aback to see how BAO has been able to sustain the pre and post-primary atmosphere resulting in massive support and endorsement by party faithful and well-wishers.” While he expressed confidence that more endorsement will spring up, Olajide vowed to mobilise his supporters across the length and breadth of Ekiti State towards ensuring a total victory for BAO. He assured Ekiti people that Oyabanji’s government would be people-oriented, adding that, BAO will never deviate from the transformational agendas of Fayemi that are focused on building capacities among people. He urged Ekiti youths to see Oyebanji as a rallying point for them, noting that, he remains confident that BAO’s administration when elected will prioritize the interest of youths through capacity building and right empowerments.
