Super Eagles coach, Austin Eguavoen has spoken about the Nigerian midfielder he’s looking to bring in to solve the team’s midfield problems. Eguavoen, speaking with Elegbete TV said he identified a Nigerian midfielder in Belgium and asked his friend to help him check the player out as he plans to approach him later.

You know Belgium is my home as well,” the coach said. ”There’s a midfielder in FC Antwerp. I’ve told people to help me check him out as well. To help me get his contact, but I only saw him on TV. I have to travel to Antwerp when the time is right and we will sit down and discuss. Because of the qualities I said I’m looking for, one of my friends Mark, a Belgian citizen, has helped me check the boy out and the boy has that quality that I said I want,” Eguavoen revealed. The Super Eagles coach recently revealed that he wants a player in the mould of Mutiu Adepoju or Thompson Oliha to be in the midfield for Nigeria but he’s been unable to find one. With Yusuf’s name mentioned and the player looking to have qualities for the position, the midfielder could be looking ahead to earning an invitation into the Nigerian national team.
