The zoning arrangements of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) ahead of the March 26 National Convention may have collapsed at the zonal levels, The Nation investigation has revealed. The micro-zoning of the Non-National Working Committee and zonal positions earlier agreed upon in some regions are now been jettisoned and all zonal positions were thrown open to all aspirants. A hard hit in the disagreement is the North-West zone where aspirants from Kano and Kebbi States refused to abide by the micro-zoning arrangement for the office of the National Organising Secretary.   ‘Why NASS should have listened to Buhari on section…     Who is afraid of Tinubu?     2023: Why PDP cannot zone presidency to the South –…   Also, the office of National Vice Chairman South-South is now been keenly contested by both Bayelsa and Rivers States, as aspirants from the two states refused to abide by the micro-zoning arrangement. Party chieftain from South-South who spoke in confidence said the presidential ambition of the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi is responsible for the disagreement between the two Niger Delta states. “The moment Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) released the zoning arrangement, party leaders in South-South micro-zoned the National Vice Chairman to Bayelsa state but the presidential ambition of Rotimi Amaechi is pushing Rivers State to reject the zone arrangement. “The truth is micro-zoning arrangement has since collapsed in South-South and some other regions. Consensus candidacy too is done with, even at the NWC level. That is why we have the like of Abdullaziz Abubakar Yari from the North-West zone vying for National Chairman when the position is zoned to the North Central zone.
