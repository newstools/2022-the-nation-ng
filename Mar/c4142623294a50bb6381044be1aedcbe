Nollywood star, Rita Dominic has shared some professional insights on how she gets in and out of emotional scenes during movie production. The thespian, who has been in the industry for over 23 years, on an Instagram live session, shared her experience saying, “If I am about to shoot an emotional scene, I have different things that help me get there. What I do is, I picture what the character is feeling, you know, I connect deeply with the character and put myself in the character’s shoes, which is why it is important when you’re going on set that you are creating that environment for your actors to be able to deliver what you want them to deliver if it is a very emotional scene you need the set to be quiet because you are going deep into that space. Even though you have been one with the character, at that particular point you are bonding with that character, there is no way that you have done all your work before coming on set that by the time you get on set you will not feel that emotional depth from the within”, she said.

So, creating La Femme Anjola, or creating Anjola with the help of the director, it was quite tasking because this woman was very unpredictable, dark, you don’t even know where she was coming from so I struggled a lot with her especially getting out of character. “I remember when we finished the Lagos shoot my co-producer who happened to direct it as well took me and the lead actor, we had to go away to a beach house and we had to stay there for like two days, just to get out of the whole thing(character) so sometimes methods like that work. Spa, beach, film you know sometimes helps me, you know doing the things I normally love to do afterward helps me get back to being Rita,” she said.
