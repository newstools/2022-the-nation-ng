Barcelona take on German side Eintracht Frankfurt, the only remaining team in the last eight to have won this competition, after beating Galatasaray in the last 16. David Moyes’ side overcame a first-leg defeat to knock Sevilla out of the competition in the previous round, while Lyon defeated Porto to reach the last eight. Giovanni van Bronckhorst’s side eased past Red Star Belgrade to set up a quarter-final tie against Braga, who knocked French side Monaco out on their way to the quarters. “I think it’s a good draw,” the Rangers boss told Sky Sports News. “We are going to prepare as well as possible to go through to the next round.

The Europa League quarter final first-leg ties will be played on April 7, with the second legs scheduled for April 14.
