Yes, some people might complain about the contents, that the lyrics focus on women, money, and alcohol. It’s not new. It’s been there for a long time but you pick whatever you want to listen to enjoy and digest.” Baba Keke, as he’s fondly called by his numerous fans, described the Nigerian music industry as a phenomenon. “Nigerian music has gone global, it has already blown and it will continue to get more expansion. Look at the way, our youngsters are churning out songs every day to attract international artistes and investors – that’s to tell you that what we are doing is right. “The industry needs more supports, though the government is not looking, we are not saying they should assist because when we started then, they never helped but they should be aware that young people are doing great things for themselves,” Ogungbe said.
