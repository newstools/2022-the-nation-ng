An internationally acknowledged election observer, Osa Osaghae, has hailed President Muhammadu Buhari for assenting to the Electoral Act. The move, he said, would chart a new direction towards credible electoral process in the country. The global election observer also hailed the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for further entrenching and deepening the nation’s electoral process. In an interview, Osaghae, who is also the Secretary General of Polling Unit Ambassadors of Nigeria (PUAN), said the new Electoral Act is a huge step in the right direction towards changing the “business as usual” slogan that has bedeviled the country and its election processes for several years.

We cannot say for sure that it would usher in free and fair elections from the onset. “There is so much work to do by the operatives and various stakeholders within the electoral system so that we can begin to set precedence that will stir our electoral processes in a positive direction. “It may not be rocket science but it is a collective resolution to enthrone good, transparent and accountable leaders in all strata of our political inclination,” he said.
