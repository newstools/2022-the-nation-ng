Former Kano State Governor Musa Rabi’u Kwankwaso has dumped the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). There were speculations last night that he might join the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP). In his letter of resignation from the main opposition, Kwankwaso cited “irreconcilable” differences as the reason for his departure from the PDP. The letter, addressed to his ward chairman, reads: “It is with a deep sense of responsibility that I write to notify you that as a result of some serious and irreconcilable differences, I have reached the conclusion that my continued stay in the PDP is untenable.   Lawan: APC disappointed naysayers with successful national…      ‘$14b lost annually to farmer-herder clashes’     2023: PDP groups clash over zoning   “Therefore, from today, Tuesday March 29, 2022, I have withdrawn my membership from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).” Kwankwaso was first elected governor of Kano State on the platform of the PDP in 1999, lost re-election in 2003, but staged a comeback in 2011 on the platform of the then ruling party. He dumped the party and joined the change agenda of All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2014, but returned to the PDP in 2017 over irreconcilable differences with APC.
