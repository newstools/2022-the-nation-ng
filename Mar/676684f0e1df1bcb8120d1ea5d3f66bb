Ifako-Ijaiye Local Government Area of Lagos has empowered 120 people in aquaculture and laundry services. The start-up grants followed an intensive two weeks training in fish farming and dry cleaning service at the council secretariat. The initiative, in collaboration with GIZ, saw 100 people graduated in fish farming and the remaining 20 in dry cleaning. Chairman of the council, Prince Usman Hamzat said the skill acquisition scheme was part of his H.E.E.D.S agenda to empower the youths, women and the aged. The gesture, he said, would also reduce unemployment rate.   ‘We must restrategise to rescue Nigeria’     ASUU shuns inauguration of panel on 2009 pact renegotiation     Confusion in APC over caretaker boss Buni’s fate   He urged the graduands to utilise materials received judiciously. He cautioned not to misuse the equipment given to them as start-ups. “It is expected that after this training, you will expand the aquaculture business, which will amount to economic growth and development in our council,” he said. Prince Hamzat promised to step up his developmental agenda to move the council forward. Each of the fishery graduands went home with 250 fingerlings, fish feeds and collapsible canopy pond, while each of the drycleaners got washing machine, fumigation machine, ironing board and a pressing iron for start-up. A beneficiary, Nephew Rasheed thanked Hamzat for the rare opportunity given to him and others and promised to return in few months’ time to showcase their achievements.
