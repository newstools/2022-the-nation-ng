PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi is being investigated by UEFA after his post-match antics following the Parisians’ painful defeat to Real Madrid on Wednesday evening. The aggregate loss, which appeared unlikely until the last quarter of the two-legged contest, consigned them to more Champions League disappointment after years of focused attempts to lift the trophy. In an edgy first leg, Kylian Mbappe’s stoppage-time winner ensured PSG travelled to the Bernabeu with a one-goal advantage. The French sensation continued terrorising Los Blancos on away turf, finding the net three times, although only one of them counted. It was not until the hour mark that Carlo Ancelotti’s men got going, but once they hit their stride they did so to devastating effect as Karim Benzema rattled in a 17-minute hat-trick.

The Athletic claimed that after the final whistle, Al-Khelaifi marched to the referees’ room with sporting director Leonardo by his side. The duo was furious that a foul on goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma had not been given in the build-up to Benzema’s first strike. UEFA have subsequently opened proceedings against the pair, with a decision expected from the Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body in due course. Wednesday night’s encounter was spiced up even further by Mbappe’s sizzling performance and the fact he is broadly expected to swap Paris for Madrid at the end of the season.
