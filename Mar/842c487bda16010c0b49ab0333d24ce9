We acknowledge the efforts of federal, state and local governments in providing quality education for our children. Government cannot do it all alone. That is why private organisations, such as Ikeja Electric, throw their weight behind initiatives that support government and drive development,” she said. Lagos State Commissioner for Education Mrs. Folashade Adefisayo, represented by Dr Funke Oyetola, director of Policy, Planning, Research and Statistics in the ministry, thanked IE for contributing towards improving the facility and adding value to the school.
