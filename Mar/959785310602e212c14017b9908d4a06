Oluwafunso Asiwaju, the estranged wife of movie marketer Kazim Adeoti, has reacted to the media tour of Mercy Aigbe and her new “boo”. She alleged Mercy Aigbe had been sleeping with Kazim Adeoti when her son was five-month-old. Adeoti and Mercy Aigbe married recently, fuelling speculations they had been seeing before. In the interview with Media Room hub, Adeoti had said his religion permits him to marry more than one wife and he was proud of the step he took. He, however, noted that although things didn’t go well at the very start with his family everything was under control. Reacting to the interview, Oluwafunso Asiwaju, on her Instagram page wrote: “Let’s get the record straight here. This post is regarding an interview recently going around by Media Room Hub with my soon-to-be ex-husband in one of his numerous lies.

I will not stoop to your level of rubbish and stupidity.” Denying Mercy Aigbe’s claim that they were never friends, the mother of four said: “As for you Mercy, let’s cut the crap. We were friends but the shame and your glam lifestyle will not let you admit it. “You were a constant friend of mine back then. I brought you close as a friend because I liked you but you repaid me by sleeping with my husband, Kazim “You were a problem in my marriage for YEARS. Now I’m happy to let you know this is only the beginning of the end for you.”
