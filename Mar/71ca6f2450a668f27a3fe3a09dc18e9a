K1 gave the advise in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos. He urged the artistes not to allow drugs and other social vices to derail them from God’s purpose for their lives. According to the ‘Ade Ori Okin’ crooner, staying away from drugs and violence will also earn them more respect from their fans. “I don’t smoke, but the issue of drugs goes beyond mere smoking. Today, people inject and sniff all sorts of things, but we must all teach artistes about the consequences of the usage of drugs. “It is not true that it is only after the use of drugs that they will give a good account of themselves on stage; It is all about education.

On the issue of artistes throwing shades at their colleagues in order to test their popularity, he told NAN that the trend is universal and not peculiar to the fuji genre of music. “We used to listen to foreign music a lot when we were young, but many people don’t pay attention to the fact that even those foreigners abuse themselves in the songs,” he said.
