Lagos State Commissioner for Agriculture Ms Ruth Abisoye Olusanya has advised stakeholders to work together to ensure that the conflict in Ukraine does not worsen the food crisis in the country. She warned that bread prices would soon get of the reach of the common man. Speaking at a newsconference on the International Day of Forests in Lagos, Olusanya alerted that the situation was already exacerbating the already-rising food prices and deepening poverty. Without concerted action to address the supply and affordability of wheat, she noted that the conflict risks worsening the bread situation. She noted that agriculture and forestry can improve food security, adding the state was determined to promote a more positive interaction to build a sustainable production system.   ‘Easy cash access to SMEs vital’     NGMC signs $50m contract to deliver gas to NDPHC     ‘Edo deepens investment in tech, infrastructure’   Notwithstanding, he indicated that the government was applying sanctions to reduce illegal cutting down of forests to produce more food. To enforce level of governance in forests across Lagos, she said there was better cross-sectoral coordination of policies on agriculture, forestry, food and land use, as well as stronger involvement of local communities. According to her, there was the need to strengthen the economy and support job creation. She said the Federal Government can make revenue by increasing forest sector business activity by working with local industry to expand production and diversify wood products. She reiterated that government was ready to work together with forestry industry partners to build a better future for themselves, their families, and communities.
