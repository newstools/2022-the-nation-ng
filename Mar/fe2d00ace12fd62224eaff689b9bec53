The main thing was to hit the target, beat the keeper – and it turned out to be the goal we needed,” Iwobi told the club’s official website. “Dominic also did very well to stay composed and wait for me to overlap. I have to give credit to him for assisting me and I was able to slot the ball in the corner. “It was an amazing feeling to see our fans like that. We want more of this feeling. From minute one until the end the fans were right behind us. If they believe in us, we can only believe, too. It’s great for us.” “We need to go into the final Premier League games and keep showing that fighting spirit, not easing off. Hopefully, now we can kick on. The main thing is to remain consistent. That is the aim.”
