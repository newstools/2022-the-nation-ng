Multiple award-winning pop star Davido stated his two daughters, Imade and Hailey Adeleke have begun probing about their mothers and living spaces. The 30BG boss, who recently had the O2 arena on lockdown for a second time with his sold-out concert, disclosed this in an interview with BBC. The father of three explained as the girls grow older, they’ve developed the habit of asking tough questions bothering on why they have different mothers and residential homes. Davido said: “My two oldest daughters, my son is still a baby. Like as they are getting older, they keep asking, why are their moms different? Stuff like that. Why don’t we live with you? Stuff like that.”   Olamide teases new song with Wizkid     Mark Owi grows stronger in middle-belt Nigeria     Miracle Nduka breaks new grounds   The “E Choke” crooner, however, didn’t state the response he gives his daughter each time they come up with such ‘unsettling’ questions.
