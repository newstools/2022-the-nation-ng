Dr. Adedeji Adeleke has gifted his son Davido, a landed property on the highbrow Banana Island. Davido made this known in a tweet on Monday. “Woke up to another land from popsi in banana again! Such a dope father! Love u pops,” he tweeted. The gift is coming after the singer held a six-hour-long sold-out concert in the 20,000 capacity event centre, O2 Arena, in London, United Kingdom. Davido’s announcement further proved that this is not the first property Dr. Adeleke has given his talented son on Banana Island.
