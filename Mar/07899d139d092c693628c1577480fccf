President Muhammadu Buhari has called for broader global efforts to make the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) record more successes in tackling environmental issues. The President said this yesterday in his congratulatory message to mark UNEP’s 50th anniversary. In a statement in Abuja by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, President Buhari said: “As we celebrate the 50th anniversary of UNEP’s existence, we laud the efforts of UNEP and encourage broader action to overcome climate change, biodiversity, rising levels of pollution and waste, being three major crises threatening our planet. “Notably, desertification and drought are threatening lives and livelihoods, which further underscores the need to boost biodiversity in ecosystem restoration.
