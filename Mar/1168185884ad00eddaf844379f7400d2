Super Eagles defender Williams Troost-Ekong has said that the Black Stars players were scared of in-form Victor Osimhen during the first leg of the Qatar 2022 World Cup Play-off in Kumasi. “I think it’s also a great work from Ghana that they figured it out, the defenders, the wings as well, Troost-Ekong said. “But I think everyone was quite scared of Osimhen. They were two against one most of time,” he added. “But we have learnt from today and we will try to exploit the defense in a different way.”   Two suspects excrete 165 wraps of cocaine     33 Export Lager urges Eagles to seal ticket     Musa rallies Eagles on “crucial 90 minutes”   “We must be clinical and against a good team like Ghana, you might get two or three good chances and you have to score otherwise you can’t win a game against them,” the Watford star said. Former Super Eagles captain Austin Jay Jay Okocha has said Super Eagles have no business to be at the Qatar 2022 World Cup if the team is unable to beat Ghana in Abuja tomorrow. Ahead of the clash, Okocha has charged the team to overcome Ghana in front of the home fans. “If we cannot win our match at home, then we don’t deserve to be at the 2022 World Cup,” Okocha warned. “We must win to qualify. And we will be playing in front of our fans. What other advantage do we need?” he added.
