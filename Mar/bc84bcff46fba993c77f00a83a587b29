THOMAS Tuchel is hoping Chelsea can find a solution to allow their fans to attend the Champions League quarter-final tie against Real Madrid. The German described the draw as: “A tough one. The challenge cannot be much higher than playing in the Bernabeu with spectators. It is a big challenge but big excitement around this fixture. We know what is coming and we are excited.” The two sides, who met in the semi-finals during Chelsea’s march to the title last season, were paired together at this morning’s draw.

The Blues, who host Madrid on April 12 or 13, are unable to sell tickets for the tie due to restrictions in place, but if a new owner came in before then, that would change. “It would be a disadvantage [to play without fans],” said Tuchel. “But in general this game is for the spectators and hopefully we find a solution. “Everybody at board level will fight for a chance, the game is a different game when the crowd is in the stadium so hopefully we can make it happen.”
