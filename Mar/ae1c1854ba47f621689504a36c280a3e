Actor Ugezu J Ugezu has argued most ladies who pose with their backside while taking pictures are classless and likely have nothing to offer. The actor said this in a post on his social media handle recently. Ugezu said that standing elegantly would actually depict feminine beauty but most ladies rather opt for the backside pose. He further said that one would be disappointed in their intelligence if engaged in a chat with most of the ladies who take pictures in that manner.   2022 AMVCA: Larry Gaaga, others battle for N1m prize, Best…     Chocolate City’s signee, Noon Dave debuts with Brunch     AMAA partners StarTimes to reward filmmakers at 2022 short…   “Majority of the ladies who take pictures with their backside instead of standing elegantly like a lady to showcase the superclass of a feminine beauty does not have anything upstairs. “They are convinced that their backs will open all doors.
