Oleksandr Usyk has thrown his rematch in doubt with his latest comments, saying he’s unsure when he will be stepping into the ring again. After Russia invaded his native Ukraine, the 35-year-old flew back to help with the defense effort. Usyk is due to meet Anthony Joshua this summer in a rematch of September’s world title fight, where he defeated the Brit to become the unified heavyweight world champion. He was in discussions with Joshua’s camp over a potential rematch date, but he has recently said to CNN: “I really don’t know when I’m going to be stepping back in the ring. My country and my honour are more important to me than a championship belt. “The bombing around is crazy,” Usyk added. “They just bombed the city of Mariupol, one of my friends got a rocket in his roof. [The Russians] are not playing games.”   Minister, Lagos SWAN laud Lanipekun at 80     Ojeagbase: Shaibu mourns ‘distinguished Nigerian’     Sevilla beam searchlight on Umar Sadiq   It comes after Eddie Hearn, Joshua’s promoter, said last week that he did not think the fight would be delayed further than the summer and had hoped for an official date in the coming weeks. Social media images surfaced of Usyk having joined the Kyiv Territorial Defense and strapped with an assault rifle in Ukraine. He previously denied that he had remained in the UK for so long prior as to escape the growing conflict in the country. “Dear Ukraine and dear Ukrainians, some wrote about me running away. Not true, I had a work trip and now I’m back. I’m home,” Usyk said in a video. “Friends, we need to unite together and overcome this, because we are faced with exceptional difficulties. “I’m very overcome with emotions and I’m very concerned for my country and for our people. Friends, we must stop this war and we must do it together.”
