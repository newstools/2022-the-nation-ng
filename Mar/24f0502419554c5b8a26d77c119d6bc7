In the absence of some key players, Rangers defender Calvin Bassey could well make his Super Eagles debut in the epic World Cup playoffs against arch-rivals Ghana. However, former Eagles defence ace Ifeanyi Udeze has warned playing Bassey in such crucial matches could back fire because the Rangers star has not yet been exposed to African football.  “Bassey has done well for his club in Scotland, but I still have my fears about playing him in the matches against Ghana because he has yet to play a match, friendly or official, against an African team,” Udeze argued.

Left-footed defender Bassey has been flying with Scottish champions Rangers this season, while direct rivals like William Ekong, Chidozie Awaziem and Leon Balogun have struggled at their respective European clubs.
