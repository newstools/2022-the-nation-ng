In some of the most scintillating dramatic storytelling ever, Makinde who also directed and wrote the very successful Awo will weave a suspense filled and penetrative theatre extravaganza that will throw up a nostalgic feeling in the audience as they get inspired by the vision that made Alhaji Jakande’s foray into education, housing and health a signpost of visionary leadership. Meanwhile, a command performance of Babakekere, which is expected to host Mr. Sanwo-Olu and his cabinet, would be taking place at the Glover Hall Marina with the larger Jakande family led by Hon Deji Jakande in full attendance.
