American rapper Kanye West has been officially banned from Instagram for 24 hours. The rapper’s suspension comes after his posts towards his ex-wife Kim Kardashian were reported to have fallen short of the hate speech, harassment and bullying policy of the platform. A statement by the photo-sharing app said it would take ‘additional steps’ if it saw further violations of its policies. “We often take additional steps against accounts that repeatedly break our rules by placing restrictions on their account,” said the statement. The parent company for Instagram, Meta also said its policies on harassment had been violated, adding that it had also ‘deleted content’ from Kanye’s account.

The comedian commented West during an episode of the satirical news show which he hosts, ‘The Daily Show.’ “You may not feel sorry for Kim because she’s rich and famous,” he said. “But what she’s going through is terrifying to watch and shines a spotlight on what so many women go through when they choose to leave.” Reacting to Noah’s comments, Kanye, in a now-deleted post shared a screenshot of a Google search for the comedian on his Instagram account, accompanied by the lyrics to ‘Kumbaya, My Lord’, which he changed to include a racial slur.
