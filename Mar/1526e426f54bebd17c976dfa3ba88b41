The Federation of Muslim Women’s Association of Nigeria (FOMWAN) and Sisters of Jannah (SOJ) have sunk boreholes and wells in some parts of the country. This, they said, was to ensure people have access to clean water. The gesture, FOMWAN said, was to mark the World Water Day, an annual event celebrated every 22 March all over the world to raise awareness on people living without access to safe water. FOMWAN said it sunk 12 boreholes across Lagos State while the same project is also carried out in other states across the federation including Abuja.

At a briefing to commemorate the day, the Chairperson, FOMWAN National Committee on Community Development and Humanitarian Services, Alhaja Khairat Sodique, said: “One of the core humanitarian services of FOMWAN is developing communities. We provide communities with their essential needs and one of them is provision of water. This project is one of our community development and humanitarian services.” She added that a trophy, Aisha Lemu Cup, is usually given to the state that sank the highest number of boreholes. “Last year, the trophy was awarded to Lagos state FOMWAN for sinking the highest number of boreholes. Lagos State also won the best state in community development and humanitarian services,” she said. FOMWAN Lagos Chapter Amirah Dr Halimah Egberongbe, said the association embarked on the project to ensure everybody gets clean water.
