Crystal Palace starlet Tayo Adaramola has described his first senior start in the FA Cup against Stoke City last Tuesday, as a great feeling. The match ended 2-1 in favour of Palace with the 18-year-old, who is eligible to play for Nigeria and Republic of Ireland. The defender said: “It was an amazing feeling. A feeling I’ll never forget. I’m just happy I could do this with my family and friends around me too. It’s a happy moment for me and a happy moment for the Academy as well. Adaramola noted that he enjoyed the support of Palace midfielder Jairo Riedewald who prepared him for the step-up to the first-team. “Jairo – what a great guy. He took me under his wing as soon as I came here so I’m really happy for him. He went through the Academy in Ajax so he knows how it can be for a young player when they come up.

It was enjoyable. “The conditions were perfect football weather. The rain was getting in my eyes – my hair products were getting in my eyes, that was the only problem! It was good football weather.”
