Pandemonium erupted in Onitsha, Anambra State following a clash between Police and illegal revenue collectors in the commercial city. The administration of Governor Chukwuma Soludo had banned the collection of revenue in the State. But the touts swooped on tricycle operators plying around Ochanja Central Market, Roundabout and some parts of Fegge, demanding for money. This led to the withdrawal of services of tricyclists as early as 7 am, compelling some traders and workers to trek distant places to get to their destinations. The tricycle operators later returned following the deployment of policemen from Fegge Divisional Police Station.

He said: “We will not spare anybody who try to challenge or flout government directive. Fegge has zero-tolerance for lawlessness. “We will deal mercilessly with anybody who tries to flout the government’s directive. They can try it elsewhere but not in Fegge.” Some tricycle operators, who spoke to reporters later, said they had to withdraw for fear of attack by the revenue collectors. They alleged the invading revenue collectors brandished machetes, knives, daggers to threaten them to part with their money. “The revenue collectors were using all kinds of dangerous weapons to force us to part with various sums of money, boasting that no government will stop them from collecting revenue,” said one of them Uzoma Okoye.
