I don’t think Olaiya is my agemate, Eddy Okonta, Zil Onya, Roy Chicago, whom do I mention in Nigeria? I am their oldest but I thank God and I am only sharing tears, my colleagues left me behind. If I bring my drum here, I go call your name, tell me where you come from, I go praise you. Those days in Lagos, they call us kobo kobo but we keep  doing music to keep their souls happy but today I thank my musicians. They buy good cars, marry, give birth to children, and build good houses. May God help all the musicians. I will not die now, I will live beyond 100 because my hands are clean,” he said. Odili, whose musical footprints span over 79 years, has performed with bands like Bobby Benson’s Jam Session, Roy Chicago and Rex Lawson amongst many others.
