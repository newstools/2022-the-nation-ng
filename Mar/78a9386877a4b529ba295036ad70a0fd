Tijani was arrested after one Moroof Ayinde reported the incident at Mowe Divisional Headquarters. Ayinde told the police the suspect, who lives in the same house with him, poured petrol on her daughter and set her ablaze. He alleged the woman got annoyed because the girl took a phone she seized from one of her children where she kept it and gave it back to the owner.
