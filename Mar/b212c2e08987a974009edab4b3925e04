The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) on Wednesday said it has launched an investigation into a viral video of corps members dancing at a yet-to-be-identified orientation camp. In the video that has now gone viral on social media, one female corper was seen giving a lap dance to a male counterpart. The video, which has attracted condemnations from Nigerians, also showed the corpers engaging in an erotic dance. A male corper was also seen hitting his organ against the female’s own with a corper heard saying, “give am well.”   Electricity: National grid restored, says Minister     Residents, scavengers clash as FCTA demolishes shanties     BREAKING: APC Reps caucus endorses Tinubu for President   NYSC in a statement by its Deputy Director, Press and Public Relations, Emeka Mgbemena, said an investigation into the video was ongoing. The statement reads: “The attention of NYSC Management has been drawn to a video currently trending on the social media showing Corps Members supposedly in NYSC Orientation camp in very compromising actions that pushed beyond the boundary of decency. “Management hereby restates that the Scheme is founded on discipline, patriotism and youth-reorientation and will never condone such irresponsible behaviour. “Investigation is currently ongoing, and anyone found culpable will be treated in accordance with the bye-laws of the Scheme.”
