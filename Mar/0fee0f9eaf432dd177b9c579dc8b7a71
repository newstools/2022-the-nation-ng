Leicester City manager Brendan Rodgers will not be able to count on his star striker Jamie Vardy for tonight’s UEFA Europa Conference League fixture against French opponents Rennes. The former England international faces at least three weeks on the sidelines after suffering a knee injury during the win against Leeds United last weekend. Kelechi Iheanacho came on for the injured Vardy in the 61st  minute against Leeds United and made an impact by providing the match-winning assist six minutes after his introduction. Rodgers has two other attacking options in the absence of Vardy, with either Iheanacho or Patson Daka in contention to replace the number nine for the meeting with the Ligue 1 side.

We had the same with JJ (James Justin). “We have to deal with the setbacks and hopefully Wesley will be okay for the weekend, with a bit of luck, and we’ll keep monitoring Vards. We’ve got other guys who will step in and give their very best.” Iheanacho has been involved in six of the eight games the Foxes have played in Europe this season, registering four assists in 388 minutes of action.
