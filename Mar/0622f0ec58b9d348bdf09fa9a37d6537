Georgia Arnold, Executive Director at MTV Staying Alive Foundation, has expressed delight at MTV Shuga’s new leap. Arnold expressed that the foundation is thrilled that the Shuga series will be getting new audiences now that it runs on Netflix. “We’re thrilled that Netflix is taking the full MTV Shuga series. Not only does it give the Netflix audience the chance to see some of the biggest actors across the continent – including Lupita Nyong’o and Thuso Mbedu – starring in several MTV Shuga series; but it also allows us to reach a brand new and wide audience with our proven behaviour-changing content for the continent’s youth”, said Arnold. Netflix recently announced that the MTV Shuga full library is now available for streaming on their digital platform.
