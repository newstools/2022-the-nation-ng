A yet-to-be-identified dispatch rider in Lagos State has been apprehended with a baby found in his courier box. The undated video sighted by The Nation has since gone viral. The suspect was said to have been caught in the Sangotedo area of Lagos. Checks conducted by The Nation showed that the Sangotedo axis, comprising Ajah, Abijo and Lekki environs, are some of the areas notorious for criminal activities in Lagos. The incident occurred amid the outrage over the murder of a 22-year-old fashion designer, who went missing after boarding a BRT bus in the area last week.
