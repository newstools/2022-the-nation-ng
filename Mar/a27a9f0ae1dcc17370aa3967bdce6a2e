He added that the agency had also discovered a new Shisha flavoured pen, whose flavours contained cannabis oil, usually used by teenagers. He stated that five shops were sealed  and four people were arrested for selling the pen with 9,932kg of the exhibits seized. The commander urged parents to pay attention to their wards by observing the things they consumed or used and the friends they mingled with, to avoid drug abuse. “As you can see, this new Shisha flavoured pen looked like a regular pen and it is rechargeable, so it would be difficult to identify it as Shisha; apart from that the flavours contains cannabis oil. “Some of our youth don’t even know that it is dangerous to consume, which is why parents and guardians need to be on alert about any new thing or item their wards bring home,” Adoro said.
