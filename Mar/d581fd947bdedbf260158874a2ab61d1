Norwegian superstar Erling Haaland is keeping his options open for a summer move, according to Jose Felix Diaz of Marca. Diaz, who covers Los Blancos for the Madrid daily, said that they were in a position to ‘assure’ that Haaland hasn’t made a decision on his future yet.

The latest on the matter is that Real Madrid will have to convince Haaland with their project rather than money, following an astronomical offer from the Manchester side. They also noted that whatever decision Haaland takes, his agent Mino Raiola likes to ensure his clients have an escape clause. The saga of the summer started several months early and there might not be an end in sight. Raiola and Haaland have no set date by which they wish to make a decision. His current club, Borussia Dortmund, are hoping the deal will be concluded as soon as possible in order to begin working on a replacement.
