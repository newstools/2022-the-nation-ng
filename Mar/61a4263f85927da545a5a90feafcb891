Popular singer Timaya has cleared the air on the hit-and-run allegations levelled against him recently. The music star explained on his Instagram that he didn’t hit the lady in question. Rather, he said he only hit the bumper of her car and was open to fixing it until he saw she was in the company of four suspicious-looking guys. Their look, he said, was what made him run away. According to him: “When I got back yesterday, I told my people to go back to the hospital to get things under control. So I went to the husband’s house early this morning; they already made a police statement and all that.
