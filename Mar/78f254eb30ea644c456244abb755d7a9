THE Mining Cadastre Office (MCO), an agency under the Federal Ministry of Mines and Steel Development, has rejected  15,483 of the over 34,000 mineral title applications submitted since its  inception. 4,997 approved titles were subsequently revoked by the MCO while 6,588 titles are still active. Explaining the reasons for rejection of title applications, the Director-General, Engr. Obadiah Nkom, said an application for a mineral title may be refused where an individual is under the age of 18 years or has otherwise been declared bankrupt under any written law or has been convicted of a criminal offence under the act or regulations. The DG told journalists in Abuja that the agency generated the highest revenue it had ever produced in 2021 in the sum of N4.3 billion. “On revenue generation, in 2019, N2.580 billion was generated for the federation account, while for 2020, which was the period of the pandemic, MCO surprised everyone by generating N2.303 billion, despite the lockdown. Though the agency has been generating revenue for the government but at a time when everyone was battling the effects of Covid-19 pandemic, the agency generated that much.
