Chairman Senate Committee on Sports and Youth Development, Senator Obinna Ogba, has described as very painful and disheartening the failure of the Super Eagles to book a ticket to the forthcoming World Cup championship in Qatar. Ogba said: “Nigerian flag will not fly in Qatar. It is unfortunate. We want to carry out a holistic investigation to what exactly happened. “I need to look into the details of what happened. You don’t expect me to start apportioning blames like others. “So many things are involved. The area I’m disappointed in is the board room politics. It seems we didn’t get the board room right. We have not gotten it right.

Within four years they will age out. “The best thing we will have to do is for us to go back to our local leagues  and start building our local league. We need to start looking at the younger players. “We need to invest in grassroots development. Because when we focus on all these ready-made. The whole system needs to be reorganized. “Government property destroyed, it’s really a pity. That stadium cost a lot of money to bring it back,” he noted.
