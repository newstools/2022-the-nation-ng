RALF Rangnick says Cristiano Ronaldo will return for what the Manchester United interim manager admits is a must-win match against Tottenham in the top-four race. This has been another difficult week around Old Trafford after Premier League leaders Manchester City dished out a humbling 4-1 derby defeat at the Etihad Stadium last Sunday – a match Ronaldo missed through injury. The loss leaves the fifth-placed Red Devils a point behind Arsenal – who have three games in hand – in the final Champions League berth, heightening the importance of the seventh-placed Spurs’ trip to Old Trafford on Saturday evening.

We have to win that game. We are fully aware of that. “We had a good week of training, the players are also fully aware about the importance of the game. The focus is there, the togetherness was there in the training sessions.”
