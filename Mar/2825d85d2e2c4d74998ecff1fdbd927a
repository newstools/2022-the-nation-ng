Federal lawmakers have been urged to expedite work on all women-friendly bills before the National Assembly. The Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP) made the call in a statement to mark this year’s International Women’s Day in Abuja. While re-emphasising its call to end all forms of gender-based violence, the CUPP also charged the lawmakers to further enlarge the space for public participation of women in the economic and socio-political aspects of the nation’s daily life. Spokesman of CUPP, Ikenga Ugochukwu, expressed sadness over the decision of the All Progressives Congress (APC) led National Assembly leadership to slap women a few days to international women’s day celebrations by rejecting bills that would have opened the political space for more women participation.
