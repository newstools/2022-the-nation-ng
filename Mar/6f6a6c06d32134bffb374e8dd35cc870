The Director-General, Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), Dr. Bashir Jamoh, yesterday said the $195 million Deep Blue Contract attracted a 10 per cent management fee of $19.5 million. Jamoh stated this when he appeared before the House of Representatives’ Committee on Navy probing the project awarded to HLS International company, which was implemented by NIMASA. He said NIMASA had paid the contract sum and the contractor had completed the supply of the platforms, except some that still remain at Onne Port, because they were unable to pay the contractors. He however said they  had received approval one and a half months ago from the Federal Executive Council (FEC) to settle the contractor and get the remaining items, which would be received within the next two weeks. The DG also refuted claims that NIMASA handed over its platforms to the security agencies.

The Committee Chairman, Yusuf Gagdi, questioned the procurement and custody of military equipment by the agency. “We don’t have a coast guard. Why are you procuring military equipment and keeping them in your custody preempting that you would have the coast guard to hand over to them. Do you think it is safe for this country to keep the military equipment in your custody with the sole aim of establishing an agency, predetermined that Mr President would approve the establishment of the coast guard. What would be the consequent effects of keeping the equipment in your custody?” he queried.
