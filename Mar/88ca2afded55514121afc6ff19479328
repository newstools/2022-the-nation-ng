In an interview with The Beat 99.9FM, the singer who preaches ‘s3x over love’, said he isn’t in any relationship because he’s yet to find a lady who shares his idea of love which he noted revolves around polygamy. “I’m not in any relationship. I’ve not found anybody that agrees with my idea of love. My idea of love revolves around polygamy. I don’t have it in me to love one woman,” the 26-year-old singer began.

I used to think something was wrong with me and people will just tell me you’ll find true love. But enough time has passed for me to realise that this is who I am. “It is not like I don’t care about people genuinely but the moment I get boxed in and it feels like this is the only person I’m supposed to be me, like my whole system doesn’t agree with that. And it just ends up ruining everything.”
