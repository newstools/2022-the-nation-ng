US-based Nigerian artist, Olusegun Osaniyi aka Lord of Ajasa, has recalled how he pioneered the Yoruba rap genre in Nigeria. Lord of Ajasa, who hails from Akure, Ondo State, claimed that although a lot of people try to deny the fact that he pioneered the now popular genre, there is no record of Yoruba rap music in Nigeria until he released his first Yoruba language rap track years back.   Don Jazzy’s Mavin celebrates over 50 women for…     Holy hypocrisy     Appointment of VC: an ethical issue   Ajasa, who called in on Jahbless’ live podcast from the United States, narrated how he became the first artist to do Yoruba rap in Nigeria. He said, “I released four songs many years back while three of them were sung in English and the fourth was in Yoruba, the radio stations all accepted the Yoruba rap and started playing in but the English songs never saw the light of the day, it wasn’t as if the English songs were bad but people loved the Yoruba songs better and never wanted to hear me sing in English or Pidgin. A lot of people in the industry know this but they will never say it, but if there’s anyone who had done a Yoruba rap before me, let them come out.”
