A former House of Representatives member, Abdulmumin Jibrin, has said former Lagos State governor, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo (SAN) are “inseparable”. Jibrin recalls that Osinbajo’s eulogy to Asiwaju Tinubu during yesterday’s celebration of his 70th birthday showed that they maintain mutual respect. “I believe Tinubu and Osinbajo are inseparable. I love the messages they sent to each other on their respective birthdays and I believe that irrespective of politics and speculations, it came from their hearts.   National Assembly transmits 44 Constitution Review Bills to…     Reps summon AGF, minister, others over unimplemented police…     Kwankwaso dumps PDP   “You cannot love any of them more than the love they share for each other,” Jibrin said on his verified Twitter handle. While Asiwaju Tinubu has declared his intention to become the next President of Nigeria, Osinbajo has kept mum on his intention. The Vice President served Asiwaju Tinubu’s administration as Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice between 1999 and 2007. In a birthday message he personally penned to Asiwaju Tinubu, the Vice President also recognised the role of the All Progressives Congress (APC) stalwart in electoral reforms, thereby further enriching Nigeria’s democratic experience.
