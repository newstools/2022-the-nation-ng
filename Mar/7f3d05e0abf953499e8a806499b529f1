The family of Bamise Ayanwola, the 22-year-old whose body was found on Monday after she boarded a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) vehicle on February 26, has demanded autopsy on her corpse. Brother of the deceased, Pelumi Ayanwola, told The Nation on Wednesday that the family would be following legal advice as regards the next line of action. Pelumi said: “We want to be guided by the lawyer, so we are awaiting the next steps on the autopsy.” He however noted Lagos Government was yet to physically commiserate with the family since Bamise was gruesomely murdered. “I can authoritatively tell you that no one has contacted us from the governor’s office or the state government to visit or condole with the family,” The deceased brother told The Nation. The Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) resumed its operations across Lagos State on Wednesday.

The lead counsel to the family, Ayo Ademiluyi in an interview with The Nation on Wednesday, asked the Lagos State government to direct the Chief Pathologist of the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), John Obafunwa, to conduct coroner inquest on the deceased. He said: “We are going to have a press conference on Friday, and we are going to take legal steps to get justice for the deceased. “We have demanded for autopsy to be conducted and we have demanded that Chief Pathologist of Lagos State must conduct the autopsy.” Ademiluyi also questioned why the State Government was yet to visit the family since Bamise’s death was made public. The State Government was yet to react as of the time of report.
