Super Eagles Chief Coach, Emmanuel Amuneke will arrive Nigeria on Saturday ahead of the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 play-off round against the Black Stars of Ghana. The former Barcelona winger will work with interim Technical Adviser, Augustine Eguavoen as Nigeria battle their West African neighbours over two legs to earn one of Africa’s five slots to the 22nd FIFA World Cup finals, scheduled for 14th November – 18th December this year. Nation Sports reliably gathered that Amuneke will finalise his contract situation with the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) next week before the Super Eagles depart for Ghana.

The World Cup winning Coach with the Golden Eaglets trusts in the players as he already managed some of them at age-grade competitions. The first leg of the crucial World Cup qualifier was initially slated for the Cape Coast Stadium but Ghana’s Independence Day celebrations two weeks ago left the pitch in a deplorable state, and some facilities were damaged which led to the rejection of the venue. Now, the Confederation of African Football (CAF) has approved the Ghanaian Football Association’s request to move the game to the Baba Yara Stadium in Kumasi. The first leg will be played on Friday 25th March, while the reverse fixture is set for the Moshood Abiola National Stadium, Abuja on Tuesday, 29th March.
