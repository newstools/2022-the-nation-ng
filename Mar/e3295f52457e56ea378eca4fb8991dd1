The Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry (NESI) has said it lost $743,490,000 in 2021 to the failure of Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) to wheel 743,490 megawatts (MW) to 11 Electricity Distribution Companies (DisCos). Each megawatt, according to energy experts, costs not less than $1 million. Thus, $1 million multiplied by the 743,490MW that the company could not transit, translates to $743,490,000 loss in the period under review. This energy production data is contained in the “Power Sector Data 2021: Energy Generated and Sent Out,” of the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The Nation obtained the document yesterday in Abuja. The document shows that the Electricity Generation Companies (GenCos) produced 36, 639,920MW in the year under review. It stated this in its document, titled: Power Sector data 2021: Energy Generated and Sent Out, by NBS.

One gigawatt equals 1,000MW. A breakdown of the document also shows that electricity generated in the First Quarter (Q1) of 2021 was 9,717.81 (GWh), indicating 0.5 per cent increase, compared to Q4, 2020, which recorded 9,668.16 (GWh), while electricity transmitted under the same period was 9,519.75 (GWh). According to the bureau, in Q2, 2021, electricity generated stood at 8,917.81 (GWh), which shows a decline of 8.23 per cent, compared to Q1, 2021. Besides, electricity transmitted recorded 8,728.87 (GWh) in Q2, 2021. The bureau said electricity generated in Q3, 2021 decreased by 2.62 per cent, recording 8,684.50 (GWh), while under the same period, 8,510.84 (GWh) was transmitted. According to the document, electricity generated in Q4, 2021 rose by 4.53 per cent with 9,077.80 (GWh), compared to Q3, 2021, while 8,894.97 (GWh) was transmitted.
