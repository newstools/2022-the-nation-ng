The Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) yesterday said gender equality plays a critical role in the prosperity of the nation, especially in the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in poverty alleviation, education, and health. Its NDIC Managing Director, Mr. Bello Hassan, noted that attention towards reducing the effects of climate change would uplift the well-being of women and girls. Speaking during the International Women’s Day (IWD) in Abuja, with the theme: “Gender equality today for a sustainable tomorrow – breaking the bias,” Hassan stressed that women remained the corporation’s greater asset to achieve its mandate.

Without gender equality, a sustainable future, and an equal future, remains beyond our reach. “In NDIC, we are proud of our women who are well represented at all levels of the organisation.
