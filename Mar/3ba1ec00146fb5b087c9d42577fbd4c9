Continuing, Bakassi said, “Another one will be to encourage people to be a bit original and responsible in how they carry on this special art form because if you ask me in the entertainment industry stand up comedy is the toughest art form in the business. It is you, the microphone, and the audience. There is little margin for error. With music, you can have instrumentalists correct you, with movies and acting, there is editing, with sports, there is teamwork. Stand-up comedy is you, the microphone, and if you are having a bad day, God help you.”
