THE nationwide epileptic power supply sparked by the March 15, 2022 collapse of the power grip is yet to subside three weeks after. Although the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) claims to have delivered 3,749.6mw to the 11 Electricity Distribution Companies (DisCos) on 23rd March, 2022, reports from different parts of the country yesterday showed that power supply remained erratic. About 1100 megawatts had been lost when the grid packed up on March 15 for the 108th time since the power sector was privatized in 2013. The TCN in its Operational Report of 24th March, 2022, put the Peak Generation of the day at 3,920mw and the Lowest Generation at 3,478.7Mw. The TCN General Manager, Public Affairs, Mrs. Ndidi Mbah, declined to respond to inquiries from The Nation on the continued low power supply. Power Minister, Abubakar Aliyu, said during the week that issues of Right of Way (RoW) were largely responsible for the delay in the implementation of about 32 power transmission projects worth $137 million.

Most of the projects, according to him, are stalled or delayed because of gaps in implementation of RoW resolutions being handled by state governments. He had also spoken of ongoing measures to add 2,500mw to the national grid. Confirming the implementation of one of the steps, the Special Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on Infrastructure, Mr. Ahmed Zakari, said the Nigerian Gas Marketing Company (NGMC) has signed $50million contract to deliver 125 to 250mmscf of gas to the gas plants of the Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC). The contract will add 800mw to the national grid, said Zakari. The Electricity Generation Companies (GenCos) have blamed poor power in Nigeria on alleged  weak transmission capacity and over N1.6 trillion debts allegedly owed them by the Federal Government.
