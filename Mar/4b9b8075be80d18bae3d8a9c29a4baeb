COMEDIAN Gordon has lamented the continuous recycling of campaign promises by Nigerian politicians. Gordon said that while other countries have moved past basic amenities as their campaign promises, Nigerian politicians are still in the business of promising the same thing since 1960. He expressed sadness over the situation of the country while blaming the electorates for indulging the politicians.   Filmmaking is where I find peace, says Omeche Oko     Olu of Warri receives Duke of Shomolu     Stan Nze highlights common mistakes made by upcoming actors   “Right from 1960 till date you people have been deceiving us with the road, light, and education promise when other nations have moved past these levels. If you think I’m lying, watch American elections, they will not be talking about road, food anymore, they will be talking about aircraft they are designing that will transport people from point A to point B anywhere in the world within one hour. “They can are talking about doing Nanotechnology, they have moved on, they no longer campaign with the basic things of life. It’s a shame that right from 1960 till date even from then verdict in 1983 our politicians keep campaigning with these things, nobody got the conscience to say let me just be done with roads so that we will not campaign with it again. “If you think I’m kidding watch out in 2023, pay attention, they will campaign with these things, in 2027 they will campaign with these things till even 2035 and nobody talks about it. People are embezzling with no conscience even those that we thought will be the head of security to prevent this they too fall into the same trap and at the end of the day we blame boys for doing the wrong things to get money.”
