Operatives of the Police Special Fraud Unit (SFU), Ikoyi, have arrested a man, Ewere George Osas, 62, and his wife, for alleged N51.9 million cyber fraud. The suspects, police said, conspired to hack business emails, diverted funds paid for such businesses and converted them for their own use. A statement by SFU spokesman, Eyitayo Johnson, said the couple was apprehended following a petition to the Commissioner of Police in charge of the unit by a law firm alleging diversion of N51,974,999.99 during Inter-Bank wire transfer of the funds. He said the couple and members of their fraud syndicate allegedly targeted, compromised the email accounts of businesses that frequently made wire payments, adding that they waited for the right time to substitute the original account that should receive the money. Johnson said the suspects confessed that the hack was done sometime in February by spoofing the victim company’s email account/website which makes it possible to carry out slight variations to the legitimate email address of the company in order to fool the victim into thinking the fake accounts are authentic.
