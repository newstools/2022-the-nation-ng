FCT Football Association Chairman Adam Mouktar Mohammed has commended President Muhammadu Buhari, sports minister Sunday Dare as well as Aliko Dangote for ensuring the Super Eagles returned to play at the MKO Abiola National Stadium in Abuja. The Eagles last played an official game in Abuja in 2011. The pitch of the stadium has since been reworked through a public-private initiative involving wealthy businessman Dangote and supervised by the sports minister.

The FCT FA boss has therefore urged the fans to pack the 60,000-capacity arena and cheer the national team to an all-important victory. “The fans are the 12th  man and so we urge them to troop out to the stadium and cheer them all the way to the World Cup in Qatar,” Mouktar Mohammed said. “The team did well to draw the first leg in Ghana, who enjoyed great support from their own fans in Kumasi, and now they should finish the job with the total support of the fans in Abuja.”
