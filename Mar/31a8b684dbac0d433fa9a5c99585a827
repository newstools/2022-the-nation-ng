Reality TV star Ifuennada has threatened to expose men who send her photos of their private part. The former BBNaija “Double Wahala” housemate, in an Insta story post, decried how grown men continually send her photos of their nudes. She also wished she could share photographs of these men on her Instagram page so everyone could see them.

The media personality wrote: “”This needs to stop. Grown men who send unsolicited dick photos, please what is wrong with you all? I wish I could do more than block you, idiots. “I wish I could post your pictures alongside your dick so your family, friends will know that you are a potential rapist but that’ll be making my own page violate the rules of this platform. This nonsense needs to stop.”
