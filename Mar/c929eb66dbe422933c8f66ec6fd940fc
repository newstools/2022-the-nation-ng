ELTEE Skhillz, one of the sons of veteran Nollywood actor, Jide Kosoko, has revealed why he chose not to follow in his father’s shoes as an actor. Skhillz told The Nation that unlike his dad and other siblings who have chosen a path in the make-believe world, he has been a lover of music and dance at a very young age.

You might see something that has to do with acting from Eltee real soon but my primary goal is to sing and dance,” said Eltee Skhillz. Further speaking, the ‘ODG’ singer said that unlike popular belief that attaining stardom was easy for him, it took him nine years to have a hit song. He said:” I’m grateful to God, my team and my fans out there supporting the boy. I’m just glad that finally my hard work is paying off and the respect I am getting now is what I have always wanted. The stardom wasn’t fast, I put out my first single in 2009 and officially kicked off my career in 2013 which makes it 9 years now of dropping music consistently. It has been hard work back to back, consistent shows and single until I finally put out a project last December and it is one of the songs on the project that became this hit.”
