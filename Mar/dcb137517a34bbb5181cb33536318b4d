A High Court in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, has sentenced four people to death by hanging for killing one Mrs. Esther Edomobi at her residence in Cocaine Estate, Obio-Akpor Local Government Area of the state. The convicts, Zakariah Dauda, Inah-inah Edet, Sunday Pius, and Isaac Marcus, have been standing trial since 2008 for conspiracy, armed robbery and murder. Zakariah, the first accused person, worked as a gateman to the victim, before he took part in her murder on May 24th, 2008. The trial Judge, Justice Weli Chechey, found the four defendants guilty as charged, for conspiring to murder the deceased and cart away her property and cash worth millions of pounds.
