In April, 2021, the FIRS issued Notices of Assessment and Demand Notices in the sum of N1.82 trillion on the company. MultiChoice, which disputed the assessments, approached the Tax Appeal Tribunal (TAT), which led to series of cases at both the TAT and the Federal High Court. With the agreement and the resumption of the Forensic Systems Audit, it is expected that the dispute will be resolved very soon.
