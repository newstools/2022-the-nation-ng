Over 100 children have been killed since the Russian attack on Ukraine began, according to Kiev. “Today, a tragic bloody line was crossed,” the Ukrainian Defence Ministry tweeted on Wednesday, referring to the figure. “Russia will be held to account and will pay for everything,” the ministry said. Ukraine’s prosecutor general later said that 103 children had been confirmed dead so far and another 100 were wounded.
